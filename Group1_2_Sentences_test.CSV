day 1 of a worse internet  slate screeches;763469243;1;5;1;0;1;1;1;5;1;1
does it ever do anything else;763469243;1;5;1;0;5;1;1;1;1;1
but when push comes to shove it cant identify how the internet has changed or gotten any worse;763469243;5;1;1;0;1;5;1;1;1;1
there are a lot of projections and possibilities;763469243;3;1;3;3;1;3;1;1;1;1
like the time a canadian isp blocked a union website it was negotiating with;763469243;1;1;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
when your really scary threat involves a canadian isp you know youre reaching;763469243;5;1;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
there was an internet before net neutrality;763469243;3;1;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
and theres one after it;763469243;5;1;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
and the rash of state laws will probably make the question irrelevant anyway;763469243;5;1;3;3;1;1;1;1;1;1
its not clear that net neutrality had any practical effect on the internet;763469243;5;1;1;5;1;3;1;1;1;1
like so many government regulations it created lots of business for lawyers and bureaucrats;763469243;5;1;3;5;1;5;1;1;1;1
but didnt do anything else;763469243;5;1;3;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
the internet is still dominated by a handful of service and content monopolies google facebook amazon netflix who only keep getting bigger and more monopolistic;763469243;5;1;5;1;1;5;1;1;5;1
not only wouldnt net neutrality have checked their power but they were its cheerleaders;763469243;5;1;5;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
meanwhile big cable companies are also converging and becoming content providers;763469243;5;1;5;5;1;5;1;1;3;1
and eventually theyll buy up and merge together leaving us with comcastnetflix amazondisney and googlespectrum or some other collection of monstrosities;763469243;5;1;5;1;1;3;1;1;5;1
net neutrality was a useful weapon for the likes of netflix against cable companies;763469243;5;3;5;1;1;1;1;1;3;1
but the idea that it protected users was googleamazonnetflix propaganda;763469243;5;3;5;5;1;3;1;1;5;1
the internet is still what it was corrupted broken swelling consuming our culture and discourse turning over the marketplace of ideas to a handful of megacorps while the media cheer it all on;763469243;5;5;5;5;1;5;1;1;5;1
it would not be an overstatement to say the washington post is proimmigration even toward persons of nonlegal status or unfriendly cultures;764375550;5;1;5;1;1;3;1;1;3;3
so the prodiversity editors must have been truly alarmed on tuesday to frontpage an ms13 story about junior gangsters endangering a maryland middle school;764375550;3;1;5;1;1;5;1;1;3;1
it is a shocking idea to contemplate preteens attending a school where gang fights are a neardaily occurrence and some fellow students are pledged to a group whose motto is rape control kill;764375550;5;3;1;5;1;1;5;1;1;1
but this is what happens when open borders allow the worst criminals on earth to come to america;764375550;5;1;5;1;1;5;1;1;5;5
a maryland middle school has junior versions of these characters  as mark krikorian wrote last february about the ms13 resurgence  under the obama administration in broken windows immigration policing;764375550;1;1;3;1;1;1;1;1;3;3
then came the obama administration which prohibited ice agents from taking into custody any illegal aliens even known gang members for minor offenses or immigration violations;764375550;3;3;1;3;1;3;5;1;3;3
ice officers were no longer permitted to arrest and remove foreign gang members until they had been convicted of major crimes;764375550;1;5;1;5;1;3;5;1;3;3
gang arrests by ice dropped by twothirds from 2012 to 2014;764375550;1;5;1;1;1;3;1;1;3;3
at the same time the obama administration facilitated a huge influx of central american teenagers across the border whom it released into the united states;764375550;5;1;1;1;1;3;1;1;3;3
the result;764375550;5;1;1;0;1;1;1;1;3;3
beginning in 2015 law enforcement agencies across the country began to express concerns about the renewal of ms13 activity in a number of locations;764375550;5;1;1;1;1;1;5;1;3;3
among the locations experiencing the scourge of a revived ms13 are the washington dc area and long island ny;764375550;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;3;3
obama did enormous damage this country by unleashing immigration anarchy and one place where the human cost can be seen is william wirt middle school in riverdale maryland;764375550;5;1;3;1;1;5;1;1;5;5
heroic working class 1 percenter bernie sanders continues to fight for working class americans by…;766752266;5;5;1;3;1;1;1;5;5;5
1 renaming post offices;766752266;1;3;1;0;1;1;1;1;5;1
2 buying a third home;766752266;1;1;1;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
2 going on his i hate capitalism give my corporate masters moolah tour of america;766752266;5;1;3;0;1;3;1;1;1;1
and its really paying off;766752266;5;3;3;5;1;1;1;1;1;3
so far the bernie sanders campaign has helped precisely zero people who arent members of the sanders grifter clan despite media fake news about bernie sanders refusing to endorse his biological son the sanders campaign has been a gold mine for members of his wifes clan but boy has it done wonders for the champagne socialist;766752266;5;5;5;3;1;5;1;1;3;5
for the second year in a row sen  bernie sanders income topped seven figures;766752266;1;3;1;3;1;1;1;1;3;1
only in america;766752266;5;1;1;3;1;5;1;1;3;5
or maybe cuba;766752266;5;1;3;3;1;5;1;1;3;5
a recent financial disclosure report shows the junior vermont senatormade nearly 106 million in 2017;766752266;1;1;1;3;1;1;1;1;1;1
most of his income   885767   came from advances and royalties according to the report filed in may;766752266;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;5;1;1
the 2016 presidential bid catapulted him to national prominence and paved the way for lucrative public speaking and publishing opportunities;766752266;1;5;3;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
but wealth hasnt changed bernie;766752266;3;5;5;3;1;1;1;1;1;3
he still puts on his solid gold pants one leg at a time;766752266;5;5;5;1;1;1;1;1;1;5
jeff weaver the senators senior political adviser said in an interview with vtdigger that questions about whether sanders newfound wealth undermines his message about wealth inequality were ridiculous;766752266;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;5;1;1
that was a pretty funny question anne  weaver said;766752266;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;5;1;1
bernie sanders continues to fight for working class people across this country so i think its a pretty ridiculous question;766752266;1;1;1;1;1;1;3;1;1;1
he does;766752266;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;3;1;1
every day bernie sanders is fighting so working class people like him can afford a third home and earn over a million a year advocating for socialism;766752266;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
im confused;766832903;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
i thought donald trump was the one threatening to delegitimize elections;766832903;5;1;3;1;1;1;1;1;1;3
then hillary clinton lost and after a brief flirtation with the purple began delegitmizing the election;766832903;1;5;1;3;1;1;1;1;1;1
worse still the seeds of that delegitimization were sown far earlier when her campaign produced what is known as the clintonsteele dossier thats been the basis for all the russia conspiracy theories;766832903;5;1;3;1;1;1;1;1;3;1
arguably hillary clinton had been plotting to delegitimize the election all along;766832903;3;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1;5
but here she is in dublin proving that the snakes were never successfully banished from ireland receiving a doctor of laws degree ironic for a woman who never follows them while preaching piously about delegitmizing elections;766832903;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
these problems are exacerbated by an administration set on waging war on the rule of law delegitimizing elections undermining truth and reason perpetrating shameless corruption rejecting the idea that our leaders should be public servants who put the common good over their own personal and political interests;766832903;1;3;1;5;1;1;5;1;1;1
thats a breathtaking set of accusations from the mistress of the clinton foundation dedicated to putting her own personal interests over the common good not to mention the breathtaking corruption of the clinton crime family turning the lincoln bedroom into a motel room pardoning criminals for cash and oh yes going on a world tour to delegitimize an election that she lost;766832903;1;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
and speaking of undermining truth hillary forgot to mention the time she tried to claim credit for bringing peace to northern ireland;766832903;5;1;3;1;1;1;1;1;1;5
i helped to bring peace to northern ireland hillary clinton;766832903;1;5;1;3;1;1;5;1;1;1
undermining truth and reason hillary clinton;766832903;1;5;1;5;1;1;5;1;1;1
you want the truth;766957682;1;3;1;0;5;1;1;1;3;1
you cant afford the truth;766957682;5;1;5;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
the courageous crusaders of the new york times have a new way for you to show your identification with the forces of true fake news;766957682;1;1;1;3;1;1;1;1;1;1
just buy a 300 shirt;766957682;1;1;1;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
really;766957682;1;5;1;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
the gray lady teamed up with very popping japanese brand sacai for a collaboration of graphic tshirts in the name of its ad campaign for the trump era the truth is;766957682;1;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;3
the black and white tees bear such slogans as truth its more important now than ever  on the front and the truth is rarely simple  and the truth doesnt take sides  on the back;766957682;1;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
theyre also 300;766957682;1;5;1;3;1;1;1;1;1;1
yes its a 300 tshirt;766957682;3;3;3;3;1;1;1;1;1;1
because if youre stupid enough to believe what the new york times publishes youre stupid enough to pay 300 for a tshirt;766957682;5;1;3;0;1;3;1;1;5;1
its the perfect demo;766957682;5;1;3;0;1;1;1;1;5;1
stupid rich hipsters desperate to virtue signal their political purity on bumble;766957682;5;1;5;5;1;5;1;1;5;3
and now they can get a tshirt that says lets discuss paul krugmans new york times column on trumps impeachment and chill;766957682;1;5;1;5;1;3;5;1;1;5
also this is a helpful reminder of  1 why most of the country hates the media  2 the fact that the media is currently being subsidized by a class of political parasites who are also destroying the country  3 the venn diagram of leftist politics unearned wealth and sheer stupidity;766957682;5;3;5;5;1;1;1;1;5;3
thats the truth;766957682;5;3;5;0;1;1;1;1;5;1
its more important now than ever;766957682;5;1;5;0;1;1;1;1;5;1
and for only 500 more it comes in straitjacket form;766957682;1;1;1;3;1;1;1;1;1;1
httpswwwlewrockwellcomlrcblogrequestionsforthenextsupremecourtnominee  i am getting very interesting feedback from lrc readers on my earlier blog concerning national security questions to be asked to the next supreme court appointment of president trump;768390330;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1;5
which is precisely why we must move now to raise these crucial questions for the supreme court nominee before hearings are held;768390330;5;1;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1
we must organize in our neighborhoods and families in our clubs churches and with colleagues from work pressing hard the media and our elected officials cutting across all ideological and demographic divisional lines of left or right of race and class as a broad national referendum on what america has become and what we want her to be for the future;768390330;5;1;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;5
this informal coalition of interest could serve multiple purposes but it should primarily bring into the sunlight the nature and origins of the national security state and the spurious props and fallacious notions which have continued to foster its cancerous growth;768390330;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1;5
lew rockwell once said that all governments would be totalitarian if they could get away with it;768390330;1;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
ours  is definitely trying;768390330;1;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
with an imperial presidency an acquiescent congress a complaisant and compliant judiciary an officious and intrusive bureaucracy and a national security state that is making us less secure at home by its reckless interventionism abroad plunging us toward tyranny and civilizational collapse;768390330;1;5;1;5;1;1;1;3;1;1
their solemn oaths to uphold and defend the constitution were either hollow empty words they mumbled with their fingers callously crossed behind their backs or uttered with an arrogant hubris they misbelieved to be patriotic zeal regarding the true meaning of duty honor and fidelity towards that decaying parchment document at the national archive and what it stands for;768390330;5;1;5;0;1;3;1;1;3;1
851 pm on june 29 2018  the best of charles burris;768390330;1;1;1;0;5;1;1;1;1;1
heres whos coming to the muslim congress conference islam religion of hope  at the hyatt regency orlando international airport;770093354;1;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
asad jafri another scheduled speaker at the conference has promoted safeguarding islamic terrorists and called for israels destruction;770093354;1;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
at a rally in toronto he implored leave isis alone leave al qaida alone leave al nusra alone leave boko haram alone  down with zionism  he also threatened you will see the destruction of israel very soon;770093354;1;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
im feeling hopeful about islam;770093354;5;1;5;0;1;3;1;1;3;1
how about you;770093354;1;1;1;0;5;1;1;1;1;1
dont expect the media to talk about this in light of the pulse massacre in orlando;770093354;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1;3
even though its taking place a hotel less than a half hour from the pulse memorial;770093354;5;1;3;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
islamic bigotry and violence is one of those subjects we cant discuss;770093354;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
unlike the terribleness of jews and christians a subject that the media can never get enough of;770093354;5;5;1;5;1;3;1;1;1;1
the muslim congress conference is also scheduled to feature sheikh hamza sodagar who endorses killing gays and in excruciatingly horrific ways the punishment for homosexual men  the easiest one maybe is to chop their head off;770093354;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
second burn them to death;770093354;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
third throw them off a cliff;770093354;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
fourth tear down a wall on them;770093354;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
fifth a combination of the above;770093354;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
coexist;770093354;1;1;1;3;1;1;1;1;1;1
also theres a holocaust denier coming to the hyatt regency orlando international airport;770093354;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
according to hyatts corporate responsibility statement its in the business of caring for people so they can be their best;770093354;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
no doubt the leave isis alone guy appreciates it;770093354;5;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
in the medias frantic downhill race to outrage each other over trump theres no bottom;772313810;3;1;5;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
charles m  blow the cory booker of media columnists desperately tried to justify his job with this ridiculous column aimed right at the nerve center of the resistances id;772313810;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;3;1
its subtle title is trump treasonous traitor;772313810;3;1;3;5;1;1;5;1;5;5
thats like a parody of a column like this;772313810;3;1;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
in it blow declares whether or not trump himself or anyone in his orbit personally colluded or conspired with the russians about their interference is something mueller will no doubt disclose at some point but there remains one incontrovertible truth in 2016 russia a hostile foreign adversary attacked the united states of america;772313810;1;5;1;1;1;1;5;1;1;1
trump should be directing all resources at his disposal to punish russia for the attacks and prevent future ones;772313810;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
but he is not;772313810;5;1;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
americas commander wants to be chummy with the enemy who committed the crime;772313810;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
trump is more concerned with protecting his presidency and validating his election than he is in protecting this country;772313810;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1;5
this is an incredible unprecedented moment  america is being betrayed by its own president  america is under attack and its president absolutely refuses to defend it;772313810;1;5;1;1;1;1;5;1;1;1
simply put trump is a traitor and may well be treasonous;772313810;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1;5
remember when the new york times wasnt a complete joke;772313810;5;1;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1
still is this what the left wants as the new metric;772313810;5;1;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;5
its incontrovertible that islamic terrorists attacked america but obama insisted on being chummy with iran the taliban and the muslim brotherhood all of whom had plenty of american blood on their hands;772313810;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1;5
this goes beyond a failure to cooperate with detention information its a refusal of aid to federal law enforcement officers;776086642;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1;3
in short this is secessionist and should be treated as such;776086642;5;1;3;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
and if the portland police refuse to do their job thats what national guardsmen are for;776086642;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
eisenhower set a precedent in this regard;776086642;5;3;1;3;1;1;1;1;1;1
portland oregon police refused to respond to at least two 911 emergency calls from us  immigration and customs enforcement ice employees inside their offices where violent protesters held weeklong demonstrations;776086642;3;3;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
the national immigration and customs enforcement council a union representing ice employees wrote a ceaseanddesist letter to mayor ted wheeler asking him to ensure the police enforce the law equally and protect innocent people;776086642;5;5;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
your current policy forbidding portland law enforcement agencies from assisting employees of the immigration and customs enforcement agency who request law enforcement assistance while at or away from work is a violation of the united states constitutions equal protection clause  the letter says;776086642;3;3;3;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
demonstrators some affiliated with the domestic terrorist organization antifa set up a city of tents outside the ice offices;776086642;3;5;3;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
after setting up camp they became violent and incited violence several times;776086642;3;3;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
when political terrorists like abolishice are backed by city and state governments thats civil war stuff;776086642;1;5;3;3;1;1;1;1;1;1
and it has to be dealt with along those lines;776086642;3;5;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
the obama administration ironically enough insisted that federal absolutely trumps state on immigration now secessionist dem judges have begun insisting the exact opposite;776086642;1;3;3;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
but they cant insist that the police have a right to refuse to answer calls from ice personnel;776086642;5;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
though no doubt some obama judge will insist as much;776086642;5;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
if dems insist on cultivating a state of anarchy in their territories it will take troops to restore order;776086642;3;1;1;3;1;1;1;1;1;3
trolling is not cyberwarfare;776967677;5;3;3;3;1;1;1;1;1;1
comparing spam and trolling to a war let alone pearl harbor and 911 and urging swift government crackdowns is creepy and totalitarian;776967677;5;1;3;1;1;1;1;1;3;1
and the media which constantly whines about a war on the press is the loudest in inciting a crackdown;776967677;5;3;3;3;1;1;1;1;1;1
take this utterly bizarre ap story;776967677;5;1;3;0;1;1;1;1;3;1
please;776967677;5;1;5;0;1;1;1;1;1;5
campaigns on their own as cyber threats roil midterms new york ap   kamala harris has been the target of social media misinformation campaigns since she became a us senator;776967677;5;1;3;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
every month for the last 18 months her office has discovered on average between three and five fake facebook profiles pretending to be hers according to a harris aide;776967677;5;3;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
its unclear who creates the pages which are often designed to mislead american voters about the ambitious democratic senators policies and positions;776967677;3;1;3;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
this is not cyberwarfare;776967677;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1;3
or a cyber threat;776967677;5;3;5;3;1;1;1;1;1;1
it isnt roiling the midterms;776967677;5;5;5;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
people create fake profiles for a variety of reasons ranging from spam to parody to political hostility;776967677;3;5;3;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
its not a threat;776967677;5;1;5;1;1;1;5;1;1;1
the aide spoke on the condition of anonymity like more than a half dozen campaign officials contacted for this story for fear of attracting unwanted attention from adversaries or scrutiny on the senate offices evolving cybersecurity protocols;776967677;3;1;3;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
for fear of what;776967677;5;1;1;0;5;1;1;1;1;1
fake profiles;776967677;5;1;1;0;5;1;1;1;1;1
the ap is creating a paranoid atmosphere over…fake profiles;776967677;5;1;3;1;1;1;1;1;1;3
in the case of california sen  harris who is considered a 2020 presidential prospect her office plans to continue rooting out fake social media profiles on its own;776967677;1;3;5;3;1;1;1;1;1;1

selena gomez is ‘crazy in love’ with justin after reuniting she’s ‘light  joyful’;113zzz;5;1;5;5;1;1;5;1;3;1
if selena gomez seems like she’s living her best life since reuniting with justin bieber — she is we’ve got the exclusive that sel’s in ‘love’ and happy to be back with biebs;113zzz;5;1;5;5;1;1;5;1;1;1
are selena gomez 25 and justin bieber 23 the new beyonce and jayz;113zzz;5;1;5;5;5;1;1;1;1;1
to sel they are because like jay and bey a selena insider exclusively tells hollywoodlifecom that she’s “just so crazy in love with justin”;113zzz;1;1;5;3;1;1;5;3;1;1
aww;113zzz;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
how sweet;113zzz;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
jelena may not cover bey and jay’s iconic 2003 hit “crazy in love” anytime soon but selena’s living the song 247 she’s even changing the minds of doubters and haters all with the power of her love;113zzz;5;1;5;5;1;1;5;1;1;1
“as much as people around her are worried that she’ll end up heartbroken all over again it’s hard not to be happy for her” the source tells hollywoodlifecom;113zzz;5;1;5;1;1;1;5;1;1;1
“she tried her best to put things with him behind her and for a long time it seemed like she had but it’s obvious now that she was carrying a heavy weight around with her this whole time now that she’s back with justin that weight has lifted she just seems very light and joyful”;113zzz;1;5;5;3;1;1;5;1;1;1
it seems that justin feels the same way as he’s reportedly working on being a “better person” for selena;113zzz;5;3;5;5;1;1;5;1;1;1
justin who notoriously left selena’s heart broken in two in the past is reportedly changing his ways to make her happy which in turn makes them both happy;113zzz;5;3;5;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
he’s even supposedly considering settling down with selena in the future;113zzz;5;5;5;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
of course before he could even consider getting down on one knee selena needs to convince her family and friends that he’s legit;113zzz;5;1;5;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
considering the biebs was absent from the selena gomez family thanksgiving he may have a ways to go on that;113zzz;5;3;5;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
selena gomez? reacts to the weeknd? going on a dinner date with katy perry?;113zzz;1;5;3;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
plus selena’s fans may need to find their chill over this jelena reunion;113zzz;5;1;5;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
justin reportedly “unliked” a photo of selena’s blonde makeover which caused selenators to demand she dump him;113zzz;5;1;5;5;1;1;5;1;1;1
gasp;113zzz;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
high treason kidding;113zzz;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
yeah calling for these two split seems a bit harsh for a social media slipup right;113zzz;5;1;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1
considering how much selena is “in love” with justin perhaps her fans could relax a bit;113zzz;5;1;5;1;5;1;5;1;1;1
do you think justin and selena are going to last hollywoodlifers;113zzz;5;1;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1
do you think these two will get hitched or will they end up breaking up again;113zzz;5;1;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1

jennifer aniston 47 has dreamed of becoming a mom for a long time  is she finally getting her wish;003zzz;1;3;1;1;3;1;1;1;1;1

but are jen and justin actually about to become new parents;003zzz;1;3;1;1;5;1;1;1;1;1
the answer may surprise you;003zzz;3;1;3;3;1;1;1;1;3;1
shes pregnant a reported friend of the couple revealed to intouch magazine;003zzz;1;5;1;1;1;1;5;1;1;1

however we have spoken to jennifers rep directly and weve been told that jennifer is not pregnant and the entire story is fabricated;003zzz;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
aw we cant say were not disappointed though;003zzz;3;5;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
jennifer and justin would make fantastic parents;003zzz;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;3;1
but nonetheless while vacationing in the bahamas on a romantic getaway jennifer and justin allegedly looked like the perfect couple;003zzz;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
flaunting their pda the two definitely seemed more in love than ever  talk about the perfect vacay justin was also allegedly super attentive to his wife aw;003zzz;1;5;1;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
the baby has turned him from a guy who didnt seem like he was meant for marriage into beyond supportive the mags insider dished;003zzz;1;5;1;1;1;1;5;1;1;1
he was by jens side as she dealt with the death of her mom and hes been waiting on her hand and food in the early days of the pregnancy;003zzz;1;5;1;1;1;1;5;1;1;1
and while we know now that jennifer is not actually pregnant we still love seeing this couple get along;003zzz;1;5;1;3;1;1;1;1;1;1
it seems like their romantic trip is helping them get closer than ever  and we are all for that;003zzz;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
witnesses did claim that jennifer refrained from drinking alcohol and smoking while on the island;003zzz;1;5;1;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
shes dealing with exhaustion and experiencing morning sickness the magazines insider gushed;003zzz;1;5;1;1;1;1;5;1;1;1
shes put on about 10 pounds so far;003zzz;1;5;1;5;1;1;5;1;1;1
but honestly peoples weights have a tendency to fluctuate  so just because jennifer may have gained some weight doesnt mean shes pregnant;003zzz;3;1;3;0;1;1;1;1;3;1
tell us hollywoodlifers  do you wish jennifer really was pregnant let us know;003zzz;5;5;5;0;1;1;1;1;3;1
this is what justin bieber did instead of going to the grammys;023xxx;5;5;5;5;1;1;1;1;3;1
despite earning four nominations for his album purpose justin bieber had no plans to attend the grammy awards this year;023xxx;1;5;1;3;1;1;1;1;1;1
rather than sitting at home alone however he decided to go out for sushi and took fans along for the ride on his instagram story;023xxx;1;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
other bystanders captured a few snaps of him walking into the restaurant as well for a full 360degree look at what its like to have dinner with justin;023xxx;1;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
of course this move is a statement and not a subtle one at that tmz reportedly spoke to a source that said justin doesnt think the grammys are relevant or representative especially when it comes to young singers;023xxx;1;5;1;1;1;1;3;5;1;1
regardless choosing not to show up to an award show for which you have received multiple nominations and then to highlight that fact by doing something so overtly casual is pretty suspect;023xxx;5;1;5;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
however this wasnt the only questionable act that went down on justins instagram live feed this weeknd;023xxx;3;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
he also posted a video in which you hear someone ask him favorite song at the moment;023xxx;1;5;1;1;3;1;5;1;1;1
he pauses and then replies starboy by the weeknd before bursting out into laughter making it clear that the comment was sarcastic you then hear the second voice in the video say weve gotta end it now that was too funny;023xxx;1;5;1;1;1;1;5;1;1;1
but we beg to differ especially as its not the first time justins taken a swipe at his fellow artist  and its that consistency that is concerning;023xxx;3;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
this past january he called the weeknds music whack so we already knew he wasnt exactly a fan;023xxx;1;1;3;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
its a significant comment mostly because it appears to be a bitter snide from an ex as we all know selena gomez has been spotted with the weeknd and though their relationship hasnt been officially confirmed theres enough evidence – justins response included – to speculate that the two are an item;023xxx;1;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
dissing a fellow artist for no reason and especially when the question posed was openended and positive  isnt cool doing it to your exs new partner is as petty as petty gets;023xxx;5;1;5;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
if nothing else its shown us that justin has more feelings about the situation than we realized;023xxx;5;5;5;5;1;1;1;1;3;1
aid worker claims angelina jolie adopted son maddox using fake details;025xxx;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
a cambodian aid worker is making extraordinary claims about angelina jolies 2003 adoption of eldest son maddox joliepitt;025xxx;1;5;3;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
mounh sarath 51 told britains the sun on sunday that he signed official papers in cambodia claiming he was maddoxs father in order to help speed along the boys adoption all those years ago;025xxx;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
he also claims he still has legal power of attorney over the nowteenager and showed the sun on sunday the adoption document filed with a court in cambodias battambong province in august 2003 to back up his claims;025xxx;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
he explained the lie telling the paper she had to change his name so the only way was for me to do it i said hes my son;025xxx;1;5;1;1;1;1;5;1;1;1
in court documents maddox is still my son he said;025xxx;1;5;1;1;1;1;5;1;1;1
she never cleared this up;025xxx;1;5;1;1;1;1;5;1;1;1
despite his claims there is no evidence that either angelina 41 or thenhusband billy bob thornton 61  who was also involved in maddoxs adoption before he and angelina divorced  knew what mounh did;025xxx;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
according to mailonline angelina has previously said she went to great lengths to ensure maddox did not have a living birth mother in cambodia and that she would never rob a mother of her child;025xxx;1;5;1;1;1;1;5;1;1;1
maddoxs adoption took place at a time when the united states was imposing tougher restrictions on adopting kids from cambodia because of trafficking concerns;025xxx;1;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
lauryn galindo  the adoption agent who handled angelina and maddoxs case  spent time in prison after reportedly falsifying the names birth dates and birth places of cambodian children who were adopted by americans;025xxx;1;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
she denied this at the time telling abcs 2020;025xxx;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
i have never been involved or charged with anything other than paperwork errors and thats what i pled to thats what im going to go to prison for;025xxx;1;5;1;1;1;1;3;1;1;1
while making his serious claims mounh  who met angelina through charity work  also revealed he and the star have since fallen out;025xxx;1;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
i would be happy if cambodia didnt see her again he said;025xxx;1;5;1;1;1;1;5;1;1;1
angelina was in cambodia in february to promote first they killed my father a movie she directed for netflix about the khmer rouge and cambodian genocide maddox worked on the film;025xxx;1;5;1;1;1;1;3;1;1;1
neither angelina nor soontobe exhusband brad pitt who legally adopted maddox after settling down with angelina have commented on the claims;025xxx;1;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
in addition to maddox the former couple are also parents to son pax 13 who was adopted from vietman daughter zahara 12 who was adopted from ethiopia and biological children shiloh 10 who was born in namibia plus 8yearold twins knox and vivienne who were born in france;025xxx;1;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1

mom actress anna faris didnt want to let the tabloids get to her but when rumors swirled last year about husband chris pratt cheated on her with passengers costar jennifer lawrence she felt vulnerable;026xxx;1;5;1;5;1;1;1;5;1;1
chris and i we talk about this a lot faris 40 said about gossip on her podcast anna faris is unqualified thursday;026xxx;1;5;1;1;1;1;5;1;1;1
we grapple with a lot of the ideas of being a public couple;026xxx;1;5;1;1;1;1;5;1;1;1
even though she wanted to brush it off she couldnt;026xxx;3;5;3;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
i just remember feeling so hurt in a way that bothered me because i didnt want to think of myself as somebody who could be affected by  tabloid st faris recalled;026xxx;1;5;1;1;1;1;5;1;1;1
it was a combination of things that bothered faris;026xxx;3;3;3;5;1;1;1;1;1;1

it made me feel incredibly insecure even though the rumors werent true;026xxx;1;5;1;1;1;1;5;1;1;1
its not the first time faris talked about the rumors she opened up to  us weekly at the august tca stars party;026xxx;1;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
that stung a little bit harder than i thought it would faris admitted about lawrence 24;026xxx;1;5;1;1;1;1;5;1;1;1
i thought maybe there is a kernel of truth to that;026xxx;1;5;1;1;1;1;5;1;1;1
but faris was able to make light of the situation she joked about being jealous of pratts jurassic world costar blue the dinosaur;026xxx;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;3;1;1
honey what if im the littlest jealous of blue i mean shes hot smart and you clearly adore herthoughts she tweeted in june 2015;026xxx;1;5;1;1;3;1;5;1;1;1

she split from him the next day;030zzz;1;3;1;0;1;1;1;1;1;1

too big for your designed sneakers kanye;068zzz;1;1;3;1;5;1;1;1;3;1
during a recent power lunch at the beverly hills polo lounge the hip hop star demanded answers from vogue editorinchief anna wintour to the question why did she judge girls star lena dunham as being cover worthy for the famed fashion bible while his fiance kim kardashian has long been overlooked;068zzz;1;5;1;1;3;1;1;1;1;1
kanye 36 insisted to the britishborn fashion icon that kim is just as talented as lena if not more so one source revealed to radar;068zzz;1;3;1;1;1;1;3;1;1;1
kanye thinks that kim has a much bigger fan base and appeal than lena said the insider;068zzz;1;5;1;1;1;1;5;1;1;1
to kanye its insulting that his friend anna is still refusing to even consider putting kim on the cover of vogue he thinks anna is listening to a bunch of knownothing corporate haters as he put it hes upset that anna isnt willing to do him this personal favor and put kim on the cover;068zzz;1;3;1;1;1;1;5;1;3;1
kanye knows that its always been a huge dream of kims to be on the vogue cover and kanye wants to make it comes true if nothing else kanye is persistent;068zzz;1;5;1;1;1;1;5;1;1;1
photos celebs who have slammed the kardashians;068zzz;1;3;1;1;1;1;1;1;3;1

the fatherofone may still has some work to do however;068zzz;1;3;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
last may in a fashion slap heard around the world vogue editors cropped kim out of its best dressed gallery when she appeared with west on the met ball red carpet in manhattan wearing the now infamous and universally panned floral print ensemble;068zzz;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1

whats more during kanyes recent concert tour stop in brooklyn wintour chose not to sit next to the e starlet despite being in the same vip box;068zzz;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
anna is no fan of kim or any reality star appearing in the pages of the magazine one spy previously told radar;068zzz;1;5;1;1;1;1;5;1;1;1
there is one consolation for the keeping up with the kardashians star wintour is open to the idea of having kardashian 33 appear on the cover of the french or italian edition of the magazine a source confirmed;068zzz;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
she hopes that will get kanye off of her back said the insider;068zzz;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
there would still be some backlash if anna allowed that to happen but not as much if kim were to appear on the us edition;068zzz;1;5;1;0;1;1;5;1;1;1

ellen sticks to vegan fare and practices yoga and its written all over her face;073xxx;3;5;3;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
boosting your intake of antioxidantrich fruits and veggies and cutting out processed foods helps give you that luminous look;073xxx;5;1;5;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
cleanse carefully;073xxx;1;5;1;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
face washes that lather up contain sulfates which can dry your skin and make fine lines and wrinkles look worse;073xxx;5;5;3;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
instead go for a cleansing cream that doesnt suds it will leave skin soft and get rid of makeup and grime;073xxx;5;3;5;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
quench thirsty skin;073xxx;1;5;1;0;1;1;1;1;1;1

smooth on after cleansing and top with your night cream;073xxx;1;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
give powder makeup the brush off;073xxx;1;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
powders can sink into lines so switch to creambased blushes shadows concealers and foundations;073xxx;5;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
as you age your skin loses radiance so give it a boost with sheer hydrating formulas that contain light reflecting particles;073xxx;5;1;5;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
go easy on the eyes;073xxx;1;5;1;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
lots of eye makeup can attract attention to crows feet use neutral shadows and a dab of smudgey liner instead of attempting a comehither smoky eye or garish colors;073xxx;5;1;5;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
choose the right lip look;073xxx;3;5;1;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
tons of super shiny lip gloss can make you look like a teenager while dark matte lipsticks can make lip lines look more prominent;073xxx;3;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
go for something in between i recommend a hydrating sheer lipstick one shade darker than your lip tone;073xxx;5;1;5;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
jennifer aniston and justin theroux made one massive miscalculation while planning their secret wedding;076xxx;3;3;3;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
uncomfortable seating aside it sounded as though jennifer aniston and justin therouxs secret wedding this summer went off without a hitch incredibly details about the malibu nuptials were not leaked to press;076xxx;5;1;5;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
jimmy kimmel did a beautiful job ordaining the ceremony finding the perfect balance between sweet and funny howard stern gave a speech;076xxx;5;1;5;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
and afterward the newlyweds embarked on the fanciest group honeymoon of which weve ever heard;076xxx;1;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
but on wednesday while promoting the new season of hbos the leftovers theroux revealed that the duo did make one massive miscalculation when planning the wedding;076xxx;1;3;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
theroux explained that to keep the wedding belowtheradar he and aniston told different guests different reasons why they were throwing a party at their house this past august;076xxx;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;5;1;1
initially they told most guests it was a birthday celebration for theroux;076xxx;1;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
but when certain people rsvpd no because of busy schedules the couple felt the need to spill the secret to entice them to be there on the special day;076xxx;3;5;3;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
of course that meant that the intheknow guests were dressed like they were attending a wedding while the rest were in jeans and flip flops so that each guest could easily tell who had been trusted with the secret and who hadnt;076xxx;3;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
it was actually a massive miscalculation theroux said of their wedding plan;076xxx;1;5;1;1;1;1;5;1;1;1
afterwards we kind of realized like that was a terrible plan because youre basically telling half your guests youre unemployed and we cant trust you which was of course not the case but we just kind of put it out there and people that said yes to the birthday we didnt tell and then people who said we cant we really put more pressure on them to be at the birthday;076xxx;1;5;1;1;1;1;5;1;1;1
and then of course there were also the friends who during theroux and anistons engagement just got into the habit of dressing in formal wear each time they were invited to the couples home in the offchance that the gettogether would turn out to be the couples muchanticipated wedding;076xxx;3;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
we also have friends who when weve done barbecues and stuff show up like dressed to the nines like this is the thing right theroux said;076xxx;1;5;1;1;3;1;5;1;1;1
and were like no this is actually just a barbecue;076xxx;1;5;1;1;1;1;5;1;1;1
on a happier note though theroux said he is relishing the fact that he is finally able to call aniston his wife;076xxx;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;5;1;1
the first couple days of doing itits a great feeling;076xxx;1;5;1;1;1;1;5;1;1;1
amal clooney is the most influential woman in london;077xxx;5;5;5;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
youd be forgiven for thinking the most powerful woman in london might be the duchess of cambridge or even supermodel kate moss;077xxx;5;5;5;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
in fact its george clooneys new bride who has taken out the top spot;077xxx;5;5;3;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
amal clooney was named 4 in the evening standards the 1000 power list 2014 following british prime minister david cameron scientist steven hawkins and prince harry;077xxx;1;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
other women crowned in the top 20 were designer and un goodwill ambassador victoria beckham at 9 recent nobel peace prize winner malala yousafzai at 12 and legendary performer kate bush at 16;077xxx;1;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
so what is it about clooney that makes her so influential;077xxx;1;5;1;5;3;1;1;1;1;1
she has recently become better known as the well dressed beautiful 36 year old wife of hollywood star george clooney but amal has been making waves as a top barrister specialising in international law for years and describes herself as lawyer activist and author;077xxx;1;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
the british lebanese lawyer perhaps most famously defended julian assange the founder of wiki leaks in his fight against extradition in sweden earlier this year;077xxx;1;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
she also represented yulia tymoshenko the former prime minister of ukraine before the european court of human rights while the latter was detained under the rule of ousted ukrainian president viktor yanukovich;077xxx;1;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
her credentials dont stop there with clooney having previously worked across numerous united nations commissions advising governments across international law;077xxx;1;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
furthermore in may 2014 she met with british foreign secretary william hague to discuss international efforts to respond to sexual violence in conflict zones;077xxx;1;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
so sought after is clooney that she recently had to turn down an offer from the united nations to be one of three people on an inquiry investigating war crimes in gaza stating that i am honoured but given existing commitments  including eight ongoing cases  unfortunately i could not accept this role;077xxx;1;5;1;1;1;1;5;1;1;1
o how did clooney become such an internationally renowned lawyer;077xxx;1;5;3;5;3;1;1;1;1;1
sshe studied jurisprudence at st hughs college oxford where she received an exhibition scholarship and the shrigley award followed by a master of law degree at the prestigious new york university where she gained the jack j;077xxx;1;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
katz memorial award for excellence in entertainment law;077xxx;1;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
since then she has lectured students on international criminal law in london new york and north carolina;077xxx;1;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
having recently returned home to london from a trip to athens advising the greek government it seems amal clooney has taken the world not just london by storm and rightly so;077xxx;3;5;3;5;1;1;1;1;1;1

my client told the organizer they never agreed nor planned to attend the event;078zzz;1;5;1;1;1;1;5;1;1;1
there was no fight that caused them not to attend the charity didnt respond to requests for comment;078zzz;1;5;1;1;1;1;5;1;1;1
ellen recently slammed divorce rumors and reports of arguments on the season premiere of her talk show i had a great summer she said in september i went on a trip with portia my beautiful wife  who i am happily married to but thank you for your heartfelt concern tabloids;078zzz;1;5;1;1;1;1;5;1;1;1

kanye west skipped serena williams’ wedding to avoid ‘awkward’ run in with beyonce;111zzz;1;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
while kim kardashian made it to serena williams’ wedding kanye west was noticeably not her plus one;111zzz;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
we’ve got exclusive details that he wanted to avoid an awkward runin with beyoncé at all costs;111zzz;3;1;3;3;1;1;1;1;1;1
there’s a good reason that kanye west 40 skipped the celebrity wedding of the season when tennis great serena williams married reddit founder alexis ohanian 35 in a lavish new orleans wedding on nov 16;111zzz;1;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
while wife kim kardashian 37 attended the big event he knew that serena’s close pal beyonce 36 was going to be on hand and he didn’t want an awkward confrontation;111zzz;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
especially after he dragged bey and hubby jayz 47 so viciously during a sacramento concert in nov of 2016;111zzz;3;3;3;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
“it was no accident that kanye chose to avoid serena’s wedding kanye is not particularly close with serena or her husband who are more kim’s friends so kanye opted out of what he felt may be an awkward evening for him kanye knew that beyoncé a close friend of serena’s would likely be at the wedding which might make for an uncomfortable situation” a yeezy insider tells hollywoodlifecom exclusively;111zzz;1;5;1;1;1;1;5;1;1;1
“kanye still has a lot of unresolved issues with beyoncé and her husband so kanye told kim that he was going to sit this one out as to prevent causing a scene and risk stealing attention away from serena’s big day which kim agreed was the smart decision” our source continues;111zzz;1;5;1;1;1;1;5;1;1;1
yeezy hasn’t come face to face with bey or jay since his epic concert rants against them and the worst place for that to happen would be at a joyous event like someone’s wedding see pics of guests at serena’s wedding here;111zzz;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
kim played it safe and made it a girl’s trip to serena’s big nuptials bringing along sister khloe‘s bff malika haqq 34 and her sis khadijah haqq 34 as her dates instead of her hubby;111zzz;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
beyoncé also appeared to want to keep the attention on serena and not any beef she or jay might still have with yeezy by leaving her husband at home as well;111zzz;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
kim and beyoncé have never been close and so no one expected any fireworks with those two being in the same room;111zzz;1;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
they were both seated in the front row for serena’s wedding but were separated by bey’s former destiny’s child bandmate kelly rowland 36 and her husband tim weatherspoon;111zzz;1;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
the night belonged to the tennis goat’s  fairytale wedding and not anyone else’s drama;111zzz;3;5;1;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
hollywoodlifers do you think it was wise of kanye to skip a confrontation with beyoncé at serena’s wedding;111zzz;1;3;1;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
blake griffin did he kick his baby mama out for kendall jenner;119zzz;1;1;3;3;3;1;1;1;1;1
its only been a few weeks since the world learned that blake griffin and kendall jenner are dating but it looks as though the lanky couple is moving very fast;119zzz;3;5;3;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
theyve been hanging out in public shes already banned from the staples center;119zzz;1;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
yes theyve checking off items from the new kardashianprofessional athlete relationship checklist at breakneck speed;119zzz;1;3;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
theres just one problem;119zzz;1;3;3;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
neither blake nor kendall was 100 percent single when they met which means theyre both in the process of distancing themselves from their most recent exes as they simultaneously attempt to build a new relationship together;119zzz;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
insiders say kendall was still dating aap rocky when she started hooking up with blake but it sounds like that situation wont present much of a challenge;119zzz;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;5;1;1
“he isn’t the type to settle down or be a good boyfriend so she’s playing the field too one insider said of rocky;119zzz;1;5;1;1;1;1;5;1;1;1
so we imagine he wasnt too torn up about being cut from team kendall;119zzz;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
blake on the other hand is in a bit of a tighter spot;119zzz;3;5;3;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
the la clippers forward has two kids with brynn cameron whom he dated for several years;119zzz;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
though the couple had experienced relationship troubles in recent months and even lived apart during a trial separation sources say cameron was blindsided by the news that griffin was dating kendall;119zzz;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
according to sources close to the couple cameron unexpectedly moved out of the home she previously shared with griffin this week;119zzz;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;3;1;1
and naturally many are claiming that kendall is to blame;119zzz;1;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
both brynn and blake have been staying at rented places since their breakup happened;119zzz;1;5;1;5;1;1;5;1;1;1
it seemed like they wanted to give it time for the dust to settle before disrupting the kids with a big move one insider reveals;119zzz;1;3;3;1;1;1;5;1;1;1
that said brynn feels totally betrayed and mortified that blake has chosen to be so public with kendall and she just wants this whole mess to be over the informant adds;119zzz;1;1;1;1;1;1;5;1;1;1
he’s in clippers training camp now so she figured it was the perfect time to do it;119zzz;1;5;1;5;1;1;5;1;1;1
so it sounds like blake and brynn were headed in the vague direction of splitsville but kendall was what drove them to finally call it quits;119zzz;3;3;3;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
fans are reportedly angry as brynn was a beloved member of the clippers community;119zzz;1;5;1;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
wait until the nba season starts and all the kardashian curse talk comes with it;119zzz;3;5;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
kim kardashian displays shocking hair loss after relying on weaves;126zzz;3;1;3;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
shes left fans green with envy thanks to her incredible postpregnancy weight loss;126zzz;3;1;3;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
but it seems that kim kardashians rush to regain her svelte frame has had an unwanted effect on her hair;126zzz;3;3;3;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
images of the 33yearold with her hair tied up in a high bun while out in los angeles last week show the extent of what appears to be extreme hair loss which the reality star seems to have been attempting to cover up with weaves and hair extensions;126zzz;1;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
and according to hair extension expert tatiana karelina it could be kims rapid weight loss that triggered her hair loss;126zzz;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;5;1;1
tatiana told mailonline it is well known that during the later stage of pregnancy you lose less hair due to hormones making it thicker and lusher but when you have the baby most women find they  seem to be losing a lot more hair than normal;126zzz;1;5;1;1;1;1;5;1;1;1
what with the rapid amount of weight kim lost and dieting in the months after the birth this may have accelerated the hair loss giving sparser looking patches we can clearly see how thin her hair is around the hairline;126zzz;1;5;1;1;1;1;5;1;1;1
thinning out hair extension expert tatiana karelina told mailonline that kims rapid postpregnancy weight loss could have contributed to her thinning locks;126zzz;1;3;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
where the real ends and the fake begins the line of kims extensions could clearly be seen during pregnancy kim showed no signs of any hair loss as she was pictured with her hair scraped back into a ponytail back last may birth and rapid weightloss are both factors that have triggered her thinning hair and made her opt for hair extensions to boost her diminished hair volume;126zzz;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;5;1;1
tatiana added that kims apparent reliance on hair extensions to give her boosted locks have now left her with traction alopecia and that she should have the weaves removed as soon as possible if she doesnt want to damage her hair further;126zzz;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;5;1;1
she told mailonline in spite of giving instant full thick hair weaves put extreme pressure on the hair and scalp often too heavy and tight the pulling and weight often cause severe migraines and traction alopecia and actually aid hair loss rather than help to recover healthy hair regrowth;126zzz;1;5;1;1;1;1;3;1;1;1
top knot trouble kim displayed the hair loss as she wore her hair up in a high bun while out in los angeles last week;126zzz;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
i would not recommend that kim keep the weave in her hair but rather opt for lighter non damaging types of extensions or a simple clipin that can be taken out often to relieve pressure on hair follicles and the scalp;126zzz;1;5;1;1;1;5;1;1;1;1
kim isnt the only star to have suffered after relying on extensions and weaves;126zzz;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
rihanna and naomi campbell are among the other famous faces to have found themselves with damaged hair after boosting their barnets with extensions;126zzz;1;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
kanye west enraged taylor swift referenced kim kardashian’s robbery in music video;136zzz;3;1;3;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
kanye west was emotionally unaffected by taylor swift’s ‘look what you made me do’ video… until she seemingly referenced kim kardashian’s 2016 paris robbery;136zzz;3;5;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
the rapper thinks it was a pretty low thing for taylor to do;136zzz;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
kanye west 40 isn’t too happy that taylor swift 27 targeted kim kardashian‘s paris robbery situation in her music video for “look what you made me do” hl has exclusively learned;136zzz;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;3;1;1
“he was upset that taylor exploited kim’s robbery” a source close to the rapper explains;136zzz;1;5;1;1;1;1;5;1;1;1
“kanye feels like that was not cool because the incident was a very serious and dangerous situation”;136zzz;1;5;1;1;1;1;5;1;1;1
ultimately ye’ “just feels as though it’s something that taylor shouldn’t have mocked”;136zzz;1;5;1;5;1;1;5;1;1;1
as for the rest of the video —;136zzz;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
well kanye could care less he and kim 36 weren’t bothered by the cryptic messages in the video that the internet consumed themselves with trying to dissect;136zzz;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
however it was that one very sensitive topic that had the couple upset;136zzz;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
as you may know kim was robbed of her multimillion dollar 20carat engagement ring at gunpoint in oct 2016 as well as other personal items;136zzz;1;5;1;3;1;1;1;1;1;1
the traumatic experience caused kim longterm emotional struggles which she still deals with to this day;136zzz;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
however she’s admitted that the robbery was “meant” to happen to her “i know this sounds crazy but i know that was meant to happen to me” kim said through tears on ellen april 2017;136zzz;1;5;1;1;1;1;5;1;1;1
“i know that was so meant to happen to me i’m such a different person … i really feel like things happen in your life to teach you things”;136zzz;1;5;1;1;1;1;5;1;1;1
in case for some reason you didn’t watch taylor’s “look what you made me do” music video we can help you decode the whole assumed robbery reference;136zzz;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
at one point in the extremely cryptic video taylor lays in a bathtub filled with diamonds;136zzz;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
when kim was robbed she said she was attacked in her paris apartment and taken to the bathroom after she was tied up and gagged;136zzz;1;3;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
then taylor makes a gunnotion with her hand and pretends to cock it back with her hands;136zzz;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
kim was robbed at gunpoint;136zzz;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
later on in the video taylor along with a group of accomplices all wearing cat masks and hoodies are seen viciously tearing through a closet while stuffing money into bags;136zzz;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
when kim was robbed she described the scene as french men rummaging through her things looking for money jewelry and other lavish belongings of hers;136zzz;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;3;1;1
so was taylor really mocking the traumatic experience kim endured;136zzz;3;5;3;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
you can be the judge of that one;136zzz;3;5;3;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
however we’ve decoded the video seen above to give you a clearer look at tay’s new work;136zzz;1;5;3;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
