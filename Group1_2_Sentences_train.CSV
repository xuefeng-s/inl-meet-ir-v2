kristen stewart not dropping another twilight film talks sexuality;010xxx;5;5;1;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
possible new twilight film can see kristen stewart reprising her role as bella swan with a new report claiming that she did not drop movie plans with former beau robert pattinson edward cullen;010xxx;1;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
some reports say that stewart said no to her reunion project with pattinson as she is busy with the psychological thriller underwater;010xxx;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;5;1;1
twilight fans however can keep their peace as the actress did not reject playing bella once more;010xxx;3;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
reportedly stewart has not dropped the possibility for another film with pattinson because there has been no official plan for the film yet;010xxx;1;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
according to gossip cop the actress casting in her upcoming film does not directly affect the saga should it be revived;010xxx;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;3;1;1
on the contrary it seems the actress hints interest for another twilight film;010xxx;1;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
she previously told press association via metro that she will be among the first to read the continuation of the saga as soon as stephanie meyer publishes it;010xxx;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;5;1;1
i would definitely be the first to read it yeah she said;010xxx;1;5;1;1;1;1;3;3;1;1
there is no official confirmation from meyer yet if she will be releasing a new book anytime soon;010xxx;1;5;1;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
but it looks like it is the only thing that producers are waiting for to start preproduction of a new movie;010xxx;1;3;1;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
meanwhile the actress has opened up about herself with the sunday times;010xxx;1;5;1;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
i didnt talk about my first relationships that went public because i wanted things that are mine to be mine she said;010xxx;1;5;1;1;1;1;5;1;1;1
a previous elle interview shares why she doesnt tend to share much about her personal life;010xxx;1;5;1;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
but eventually stewart realised that she had several eyes on her and that talking about her personal life can benefit someone else;010xxx;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;3;1;1
it was an opportunity to surrender a bit of what was mine to make even one other person feels good about themselves she added;010xxx;1;5;1;1;1;1;5;1;1;1
she was in a relationship with pattinson but the couple broke up in 2013 last year the actress came out as a lesbian;010xxx;1;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
she was in a relationship with visual effects producer alicia cargile;010xxx;1;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
the final twilight film was released in 2012;010xxx;1;5;1;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
since then the actress has appeared in a series of films such as olivier assayas the clouds of sils maria for which she won the cesar award for best supporting actress;010xxx;1;5;1;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
stewart has also played jodie fosters daughter in the thriller panic room in which she got a young artist award nomination for best leading actress in a feature film;010xxx;1;5;1;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
jealous kim tries to steal beyonces baby spotlight;016zzz;3;1;1;3;1;1;1;1;1;1
while the bey hive was buzzing yesterday about beyonces shocking baby news radaronlinecom has learned that kim kardashian was busy with her own plan to steal back the spotlight;016zzz;3;3;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
kim was shocked at the beyonce news and she was totally checking it out and seeing how many people like the post an insider told radar;016zzz;1;3;1;1;1;1;5;1;1;1
then when her friend chrissy teigen started tweeting that she was best friends with beyonce she was actually hurt and worried;016zzz;1;5;1;3;1;1;3;1;1;1
as radar has reported there is a longstanding rivalry between queen bey and kardashian 36 and according to an insider kardashian is not letting it go anytime soon;016zzz;1;3;1;1;1;1;1;5;1;1
thats why she started tweeting the source told radar;016zzz;1;5;1;1;1;1;5;1;1;1
she thinks shes a bigger star than beyonce she is the biggest star in the world;016zzz;1;5;1;1;1;1;3;1;1;1
and it was time to remind her fans;016zzz;3;5;1;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
the first attempt came right after beyonce announced the news;016zzz;1;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
kardashian took to her twitter to share with her fans that she had finally updated her app kim kardashian hollywood;016zzz;1;5;1;3;1;1;1;1;1;1
had to change up my look in kimkardashiangame have you guys seen the latest update kkhofficial kardashian wrote on twitter;016zzz;1;5;1;1;1;1;5;1;1;1
seeing that had not done anything to put a dent in beyonces big news the kuwtk wife of yeezy rapper kanye west tried yet again – by announcing that she and pal chrissy tiegen were starting their own book club;016zzz;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;3;1;1
so guys chrissyteigen  jenatkinhair  i are starting a book club kardashian posted;016zzz;1;5;1;1;1;1;5;1;1;1
sadly no massive celebrations erupted like she was hoping;016zzz;3;3;3;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
but thats not all;016zzz;3;1;1;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
earlier in the day kardashian misled fans to believe that she and west 39 were also expecting another child together;016zzz;3;3;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
when a fan asked it it were true however kardashian quickly shot it down;016zzz;1;3;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
while everyone was tweeting and sending congratulations to beyonce and jay z kim and kanye did not say one word about it on their social media the source told radar;016zzz;1;5;1;1;1;1;5;1;1;1
the fact that beyonce is going to have more kids than kim once her twins are born absolutely drives kim nuts;016zzz;1;3;1;5;1;1;5;1;1;1
kim was totally trying to steal beyonces baby thunder yesterday;016zzz;1;3;1;5;1;1;5;1;1;1
as radar reported kardashian and west – like beyonce and jay z – hit several rough patches in their superstar union this year leading many to believe that the two were headed for a messy divorce;016zzz;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;5;1;1
but it seems that one surefire way to get over a slump is by getting another baby bump;016zzz;5;3;1;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
kim is going to try harder than ever right now to get pregnant because she is constantly searching for a way to one up beyonce the insider claimed;016zzz;1;5;1;1;1;1;5;1;1;1
she seems so jealous that beyonce is more famous than she is it doesnt seem like kim will ever be okay with that;016zzz;1;3;1;1;1;1;5;1;1;1
do you think that kim kardashian should get pregnant so that she can have as many children as beyonce has;016zzz;1;5;1;0;5;1;1;1;1;1
tell us your thoughts below;016zzz;1;5;1;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
kim kardashian nude cookbook on the way;017zzz;1;5;1;1;3;1;5;1;1;1
not everyone is a fan of kim kardashian andor the books she pretends to write;017zzz;5;1;5;0;1;1;1;1;3;1
just the other day some 74year old got arrested after vandalizing six copies of kims selfiebased memoir;017zzz;1;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
but we have a pretty strong feeling the only damage anyone will do to the tome discussed will be to spray ones sticky seed all over its page;017zzz;5;3;3;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
if you know what we mean;017zzz;5;5;1;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
according to one of the funniest radar online stories weve read in awhile kardashian is considering the release of a nude cookbook;017zzz;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
yes a nude cookbook as in a cookbook that features family recipes and photos of kim kardashian nude;017zzz;3;5;1;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
we challenge anyone out there to come up with a better idea that a book that will enable readers to feed both their actual appetite and their sexual appetite at the same time;017zzz;3;3;3;0;1;1;1;1;3;1
a video report on radar claims that kim kardashian has found a new way to line her pockets even when she doesnt have any adding by way of explanation;017zzz;1;5;1;1;1;1;5;1;1;1
the reality tart is pitching publishers on the idea of a cookbook in which she poses nude next to her favorite recipes;017zzz;1;5;1;1;1;1;5;1;1;1
this may seem like a farfetched concept but ask yourself two things;017zzz;3;1;3;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
you dont need to tell us the answer to question numberone we understand if youre a bit embarrassed to admit it;017zzz;5;3;5;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
but the answer to question numbertwo is revealed below;017zzz;1;5;1;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
before you dismiss this idea as pure nonsense allow us to direct your attention to david thorpes rude food;017zzz;5;1;3;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
in that cookbook the late photographer conjures images with subtle juxtapositions of attractive and tastefully nude models along with an astonishing variety of foodstuffs;017zzz;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
via amazon this allowed him to create the ultimate in humerous and safe innuendo;017zzz;3;5;3;3;1;1;1;1;1;1
an anonymous insider tells radar that kardashian is convinced her concept will succeed because she thinks shes in the best shape of her life after having two children;017zzz;1;5;1;1;1;1;3;3;1;1
she does look pretty good at the moment dont you think;017zzz;5;1;5;0;5;1;1;1;1;1
last week the national enquirer also alleged that kim was considering a naked cookbook writing that the wife of kanye west wanted to show the world her generous cupcakes;017zzz;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;5;1;1
by this we assume the publication meant her very large breasts;017zzz;5;3;3;0;1;1;1;1;3;1
for someone who has been out of the spotlight for months ever since that scary armed robbery in paris in early october this would certainly be a way for kardashian to get the world talking about her once again;017zzz;5;1;5;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
she could make the talk show rounds;017zzz;5;5;1;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
she could gain new social media followers;017zzz;5;5;1;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
she could recapture all the attention lost to sister kylie jenner;017zzz;5;3;3;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
we really dont see any drawbacks;017zzz;5;5;3;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
moreover come on would this really be the most ridiculous idea for a book from a member of the kardashianjenner family;017zzz;5;1;5;0;5;1;1;1;1;1
considering the following releases all of which are 100 real it may actually be the best;017zzz;5;1;5;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
donald trump and first lady melania keep separate bedrooms;028zzz;1;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
on march 17 first lady melania trump clad in a belted custom alice roi coatdress gianvito rossi stilettos and gucci sunglasses strode across the white house lawn with her husband donald;028zzz;1;5;1;3;1;1;1;1;1;1
with the press corps photographers snapping away the 46yearold sloveniaborn stunner smiled for the cameras as the billionaire 70 awkwardly reached for her hand and clutched the tips of her fingers;028zzz;1;3;1;3;1;1;1;1;1;1
once the obligatory photo op was complete she donald and their 11yearold son barron boarded marine one potus helicopter which whisked them away to their palm beach florida estate maralago;028zzz;1;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
aboard the chopper  and away from the public eye  melania dropped the act;028zzz;1;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
and donalds hand;028zzz;1;5;1;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
melania a family source alleges in the new issue of us weekly does not keep hidden from everyone around her how miserable she is;028zzz;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;5;1;1
that includes the presi­dent himself;028zzz;1;5;1;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
multiple sources claim that the former fashion model  whos currently living 200 miles away from washington dc in nycs trump tower while barron finishes the school year  refuses to share a bed with donald even on the rare occasions when they sleep in the same city;028zzz;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;5;1;1
they have separate bedrooms says another trump insider;028zzz;1;5;1;1;1;1;5;1;1;1
they never spend the night together  ever;028zzz;1;5;3;1;1;1;5;1;1;1
a third source says the couple do sleep in the same room but keep separate beds its very royal of them;028zzz;1;5;1;1;1;1;3;5;1;1
upset with the former reality star for trapping her in a life she despises melania wants as little to do with donald as possible explains the family source;028zzz;1;5;1;1;1;1;3;3;1;1
she is not interested in donald the presidency or anything involving him;028zzz;1;3;1;3;1;1;5;1;1;1
a rep for melania denies the claims telling us its unfortunate that you are going to feature unnamed sources that have provided fictional accounts;028zzz;1;5;1;1;1;1;5;1;1;1
since assuming the role of first lady january 20 melania has kept an extremely limited official schedule after the inauguration she mostly stayed in her gilded fifth avenue triplex penthouse and didnt set foot in the nations capital again for 21 days and the few official appearances she has made were done so begrudgingly;028zzz;3;1;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
melania escorted akie abe the japanese prime ministers wife around palm beach in february but only because she was going to be at maralago already according to the family source;028zzz;1;5;1;1;1;1;3;3;1;1
she refused to do it in washington;028zzz;1;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1

justin biebers purpose show at barclays center lacks focus;042xxx;5;3;1;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
justin bieber may need to work a little harder on his focus;042xxx;5;3;1;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
sure keeping it together on a massive outing like his purpose tour night after night is tough;042xxx;5;3;3;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
so its understandable that his mic was at his side wednesday night when he was supposed to be singing making it clear that he was lip syncing for at least part of the show;042xxx;5;5;5;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
and there were points when he was standing still while his phalanx of 12 dancers were around him;042xxx;1;5;1;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
but bieber forgot to sing his most recent no 1 single love yourself in the middle of his show;042xxx;1;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
i got a little ahead of myself bieber said as the stagehands rushed to return the sofa they had already removed as well as tuning his acoustic guitar again;042xxx;1;5;1;1;1;1;5;1;1;1
should i skip it;042xxx;1;5;1;0;1;1;5;1;1;1
of course the capacity crowd screamed no and to his credit bieber a little redfaced delivered a strong version of the song;042xxx;1;5;1;3;1;1;1;1;1;1
though bieber pulled his career out of a tailspin with the recent string of three no 1 hits from his album purpose his concert at barclays center wednesday night showed that his career rebound hasnt solved all his problems;042xxx;3;1;3;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
bieber returns to barclays center again thursday much to the chagrin of new york islanders fans whose playoff game is delayed until friday to accommodate the show;042xxx;1;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
the purpose tour is quite the spectacle with its multilevel stage and elaborately choreographed routines but bieber ends up being the center of attention and at times the weakest link;042xxx;3;3;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
he opens the show in a massive glass box and in one of the nights best moments dances in a circular video screen that looks like hes trapped in a cage;042xxx;1;5;1;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
no need for collegelevel performance art classes to figure out what that means;042xxx;1;5;1;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
the show has its moments with the upbeat get used to it seeming primed to be his next charttopper;042xxx;1;3;1;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
bieber looks energized when hes doing flips on a giant trampoline during company;042xxx;5;3;1;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
and the tropicaltinged dance numbers like what do you mean and where are you now hold up well giving his faithful fan base plenty to scream about;042xxx;3;3;1;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
they want him to succeed and most everyone loves a comeback;042xxx;1;3;1;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
but before that becomes a secure possibility bieber needs to find his purpose a little more interesting;042xxx;5;3;1;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
set list mark my words  where are ü now  get used to it  ill show you  the feeling  boyfriend  untitled  home to mama  love yourself  been you  company  no sense  hold tight  no pressure  as long as you love me  drum solo  children  life is worth living  what do you mean  baby  purpose  encore sorry;042xxx;1;5;1;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
justin bieber vacation purpose tour on hold after awards show rant  celeb dirty laundry;042zzz;1;5;1;0;3;1;1;1;1;1
it appears that justin biebers purpose tour is on hold and justin is on vacation with friends justin definitely needs some time off after slamming awards shows as fake and hollow;042zzz;5;1;1;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
the vacation photos started popping up on justins instagram on may 25;042zzz;1;5;1;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
looks as if justin went camping with an assortment of friends;042zzz;5;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
the singer who normally writes very little or nothing at all on his social media posts wrote these are the nights i live for;042zzz;1;5;1;1;1;1;5;1;1;1
while taking some time off justin is jetskiing maybe doing a little cliff diving and just hanging out;042zzz;1;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
justin looks pretty relaxed in the photos;042zzz;5;3;3;3;1;1;1;1;1;1
on may 27 justin posted a selfie on instagram – he appears to be relaxing by the pool with palm trees in the background;042zzz;1;5;1;3;1;1;1;1;1;1
but whats going on with the purpose tour;042zzz;1;3;1;0;5;1;1;1;1;1
checking out justins website all previous concert dates have been removed;042zzz;1;5;1;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
you cant tell for certain if justin scheduled time off or decided at the last minute to take a vacation because hes burned out;042zzz;3;3;5;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
the first signs that justin bieber might need a break came when the singer went on blast telling everyone that just because you buy a cd doesnt mean you are entitled to stop him in the street like hes your bestie;042zzz;3;3;1;3;1;1;1;1;1;1
you buy a cd and thats all youre entitled to a cd not a piece of justin;042zzz;3;3;1;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
next justin kind of snapped after the billboard music awards saying all these awards shows are all fake shallow and meaningless;042zzz;1;3;1;3;1;1;1;1;1;1
yet a few days later justin profusely thanked the teen choice awards for the three nominations he received;042zzz;1;3;1;3;1;1;1;1;1;1
once again justin used instagram to express himself;042zzz;1;5;1;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
the purpose tour resumes on june 11 with several stops in canada and then through the united states through july 19;042zzz;1;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
after two tokyo shows in august the tour resumes in europe in september and runs nonstop through the end of november;042zzz;1;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
a schedule like that might cause any entertainer to put a tour on hold for a couple of weeks;042zzz;5;3;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
hopefully justin will get some much needed rr and put all the controversy behind him when the tour resumes;042zzz;5;3;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
justin bieber was spotted out and about in los angeles california on may 27 2016;042zzz;1;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
he was wearing a sleeveless red and blue checkered shirt with cut off sweat pants by fameflynet;042zzz;1;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1

moving fashion forward brooding tom hiddleston has a new blonde in his life as he poses with dog for suave gucci campaign after taylor swift split;045xxx;1;5;1;3;1;1;1;1;1;1
hes one of hollywoods most debonair stars;045xxx;3;3;3;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
so its little wonder that gucci have recruited tom hiddleston to be the face of their cruise 2017 campaign which sees the star decked out in an array of suave tailoring;045xxx;3;3;1;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
moving forward from his sudden split with taylor swift the 35yearold actor shows of his leading man credentials as he takes centrestage in the retrostyled campaign;045xxx;3;3;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
flanked by a retinue of afghan hounds the highrise star seemingly replaced one blonde with three loyal ones;045xxx;3;3;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
never failing to impress with his sartorial styling on the red carpet the actor only seems a natural choice for the campaign;045xxx;3;3;1;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
cutting a dashing yet suitably brooding figure alessandro micheles vision for the italian fashion houses resurgent menswear collection sees the actor captured in a series of homely tableau;045xxx;1;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1

in another shot tom is seen stood in the midst of three hounds decked out in a dark windowpane check two piece ready for a day at the office  or indeed having just returned home from it;045xxx;1;3;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
the series of colourful yet muted portraits show the thor and avengers actor in his element a subtle yet commanding presence  who looks even better thanks to the tailoring;045xxx;5;3;1;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
the campaign comes just weeks after the his relationship with popstrel imploded with sources close to each of the stars claiming each of them ended it on their own terms;045xxx;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;5;1;1
however last week tom put paid to any rumours of hardfeelings or feuding between the two as he said they had remained on amicable terms;045xxx;3;3;1;1;1;1;1;5;1;1
when asked by people at the emmy awards last week if him and taylor had remained on friendly terms since the split he replied yes;045xxx;1;5;1;1;1;1;5;1;1;1
yes we are with a smile;045xxx;1;5;1;1;1;1;5;1;1;1

the weeknd was spotted holding hands with justin bieber’s ex;133zzz;1;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
if you’re an avid us weekly reader it might appear that there are only about a dozen single people in hollywood as they all date each other;133zzz;5;1;3;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
it’s like six degrees of separation with kevin bacon only for influencers with a penchant for fit tea and waist trainers where scott disick is the connecting factor;133zzz;5;3;1;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
here we prove that theory after selena gomez and the weeknd dated for about a year they broke up and she was spotted back with her exboyfriend justin bieber almost immediately;133zzz;5;3;3;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
now it looks like the weeknd wants revenge and is using his party monster ways to get it;133zzz;5;1;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
while justin bieber and selena gomez have been attending church twice in one day—apparently the new couple has a lot to repent for—the weeknd has been parading models around;133zzz;5;3;3;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
the weeknd was caught canoodling with bieber’s rumored ex model yovanna ventura;133zzz;1;3;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
he was even spotted holding hands with the model which is almost as serious as becoming instagram official;133zzz;3;1;3;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
according to an us weekly source who saw the weeknd in action “he was parading her around;133zzz;1;5;1;1;1;1;3;1;1;1
he was trying to make it obvious that he was with someone they were pretty affectionate and were together the entire night”;133zzz;1;3;1;3;1;1;3;1;1;1
the potential new couple was snapped at a birthday party in beverly hills for french montana who dated khloe kardashian whose sister kourtney kardashian was rumored to have dated bieber—and to make everything more confusing the weeknd previously dated bella hadid a close friend of the kardashianjenner family;133zzz;3;1;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
it’s all very degrassi only drake is slightly less involved—although he’s rumored to be hooking up with hadid and feuding with the weeknd because of it;133zzz;5;1;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
the weeknd and ventura were also seen leaving hyde nightclub together in the back of an suv much like leonardo dicaprio and his model friend 19yearold juliette perkins;133zzz;1;1;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
and there’s another leo link—the weeknd made sure to stop by leonardo dicaprio’s 43rd birthday with model emily ratajkowski;133zzz;1;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
leo’s birthday was held at the highlight room a rooftop club that opened above the dream hollywood hotel in los angeles and currently has two stars on yelp;133zzz;1;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
of course there were plenty of models milling about leaving ample options for the weeknd—but not all of them had been linked to bieber in the past;133zzz;5;3;3;3;1;1;1;1;1;1
it looks like bieber gomez and the weeknd should all start writing for their next breakup albums…or maybe they can all just collaborate on one;133zzz;5;3;3;0;1;1;1;1;1;1

“a lot of you that watch the show know he has dyslexia so school has always been a very big challenge for us in our household” she said;192xxx;1;5;1;1;1;1;5;1;1;1
“so i went to his new school for a parentteacher conference… he’s getting straight a’s and so i broke down crying in the middle of the parentteacher conference”;192xxx;1;5;1;3;1;1;5;1;1;1
the star who us weekly notes is a mom to michael 20 and lola 16 as well joked that the teachers saw her crying and felt the need to reassure her that they just delivered good news;192xxx;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;5;1;1
“i had to wait three kids to hear these words”;192xxx;1;5;1;1;1;1;5;1;1;1
she went on to explain that her son received word of his grades before she did but managed to keep them a secret from her so that she’d be surprised when the big moment came;192xxx;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;5;1;1
however when it did he laughed uncomfortably while she cried tears of joy;192xxx;1;3;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
while the 47yearold host fought back her tears on set seacrest tried to share some inspiring words with her but couldn’t handle seeing her cry;192xxx;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
“i see the way you handle career and most importantly family… and it’s so impressive” he said of ripa and her husband mark consuelos;192xxx;1;5;1;1;1;1;5;1;1;1
“i am inspired by it and anybody who knows you and watches you agrees;192xxx;1;5;1;1;1;1;5;1;1;1
when my mom cries it makes me cry so when you cry it makes me cry… it’s like a trigger”;192xxx;1;5;1;1;1;1;5;1;1;1
this isn’t the first time that ripa has gushed publicly over her son’s academic achievements;192xxx;3;5;1;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
in june she posted a photo of her whole family celebrating joaquin’s graduation from middle school;192xxx;1;5;1;3;1;1;1;1;1;1
the family posed together surrounding the youngster in his green cap and gown;192xxx;1;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
later they celebrated the big occasion with a starstudded party;192xxx;1;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
now it seems that the family has something else to celebrate given joaquin’s impressive performance in high school so far;192xxx;5;3;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1

kate middleton desperate to save prince william marriage cant let go of pampered royal lifestyle  celeb dirty laundry;200zzz;1;3;1;0;1;1;1;1;3;1
kate middleton might be angry with her husband prince william for embarrassing their family with his bizarre dancing and drinking during his ski trip and all of the cheating rumors but that doesn’t mean she’ll be divorcing him anytime soon;200zzz;5;1;5;5;1;1;1;1;3;1
in fact the duke and duchess of cambridge tried to convince everyone that they are still madly in love during their trip to paris this weekend;200zzz;3;1;3;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
prince william and kate middleton rekindled their shared love of art during a visit to the musee d’orsay in paris;200zzz;3;3;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
the duke and duchess first fell in love while studying art history at st andrew’s university in scotland nearly two decades ago;200zzz;1;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
eyewitnesses say that art enthusiast kate middleton asked lots of questions during their tour of the museum with william by her side kate certainly did show the public that she was still angry at her husband as she tried to remain as calm and engaged as possible during their tour;200zzz;1;3;1;1;1;1;1;5;1;1
insiders say that prince william meanwhile looked tired and tense;200zzz;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;5;1;1
judging from the photos that were snapped there is some major tension between the royal couple right now  kate looked absolutely miserable;200zzz;5;1;5;0;1;1;1;1;3;1
there’s a possibility that kate middleton is worried that if she does divorce prince william she won’t have the same privileged lifestyle that she has now;200zzz;5;1;3;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
it’s no secret that the duchess of cambridge makes headlines simply because she’s prince william’s wife;200zzz;5;3;3;0;1;1;1;1;3;1
but if she decides to pull the plug on her royal marriage kate’s life won’t be the same;200zzz;5;5;5;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
she won’t be generating publicity for what she wore or how she looked during her public appearances;200zzz;5;5;3;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
and that’s probably what she’ll miss the most kate middleton loves the spotlight but without the royal family she won’t be in it anymore;200zzz;5;1;5;0;1;1;1;1;3;1
plus royal observers know that if kate middleton forgives prince william for his antics drunken antics now there’s a good chance that she’ll forgive him again and again;200zzz;5;1;3;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
in other words the duchess is turning a blind eye to her husband’s behavior because she probably doesn’t have any other choice;200zzz;5;1;5;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
it’s either this or she goes back to her mother carole middleton’s party favor business;200zzz;5;1;5;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
do you agree;200zzz;1;3;1;0;3;1;1;1;1;1
tell us do you think kate middleton is desperately trying to hold on to her royal marriage;200zzz;3;1;1;0;5;1;1;1;1;1
is she worried about letting go of her pampered lifestyle;200zzz;5;3;3;0;3;1;1;1;1;1

jennifer hudson and kelly clarkson are coming to the voice;214xxx;1;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
on wednesday the “hairspray live” star shared the news with her followers on twitter writing “let’s do this teamjhud” hudson will sit alongside miley cyrus adam levine and blake shelton;214xxx;1;5;1;1;1;1;3;1;1;1
“in tears thinking of what this means and represents to me and knowing and walking the journey” she wrote;214xxx;1;5;1;1;1;1;5;1;1;1
of course hudson knows her way around a singing competition show so we think it’s safe to say she’ll be a great fit;214xxx;5;3;5;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
not only was she a winning coach on the uk version of “the voice” she also got her start appearing as a contestant on the third season of “american idol” despite coming in seventh place she’s hands down one of the most famous “idol” alums;214xxx;3;3;3;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
“jennifer is an extraordinary vocal talent and one of the premier voices of our time she embodies the experience expertise positivity and sheer talent that ‘the voice’ stands for” paul telegdy nbc’s president of nbc’s alternative and reality group said in a statement obtained by variety;214xxx;1;5;1;1;1;1;5;1;1;1
“her exceptional skills as a singer and actress have extended to film television and broadway which makes her an incredible addition and a natural fit for our show”;214xxx;1;5;1;5;1;1;5;1;1;1
later on thursday it was announced that “american idol” og kelly clarkson would also be joining the nbc show where she’ll coach with levine and shelton in season 14 according to variety;214xxx;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
the outlet noted a fourth coach for that season has not yet been confirmed;214xxx;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;5;1;1
“i’m so excited to join ‘the voice’ at nbc” clarkson said in a statement;214xxx;1;5;1;1;1;1;5;1;1;1
“we’ve been going back and forth with them for years on joining their team and the timing hasn’t been right until now;214xxx;1;5;1;5;1;1;5;1;1;1
ever since nbc and i worked together on my christmas special years ago we have established an amazing relationship and i have always loved coming on to either mentor or perform on ‘the voice’ over the years;214xxx;3;3;1;0;1;1;3;1;1;1
i can’t wait to turn my chair and see the faces of up and coming artists that i may be able to help get that push and support they’ve been needing to break into this industry;214xxx;3;3;1;0;1;1;3;1;1;1
watch out shelton… i’m comin’ to win”;214xxx;1;5;1;5;1;1;5;1;1;1
the fact that hudson and clarkson are headed to “the voice” seems like a loss for the team in charge of the “american idol” reboot especially since the two singers are among the competition show’s biggest success stories;214xxx;1;3;1;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
variety reports clarkson was asked to judge on “idol” but it doesn’t look like that’s happening now;214xxx;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1

kris jenner is so angry about her portrayal in caitlyns memoir;215xxx;1;3;1;3;1;1;1;1;1;1
the mother and daughter then talk about caitlyns accusation that kris had been hoarding money for years;215xxx;1;5;1;3;1;1;1;3;1;1
she never paid a bill from 1972 the family matriarch tells kim;215xxx;1;5;1;1;1;1;5;1;1;1
she didnt know how much a gardener was and in the book writes well kris didnt need me anymore all the checks for keeping up with the kardasahians they all went to kris;215xxx;1;5;1;3;1;1;5;1;1;1
she continues how about it went to the mortgage and the insurance and education you start talking about how i was hoarding money when we didnt even have it;215xxx;1;5;1;1;1;1;3;3;1;1
kris also claims caitlyn wasnt truthful about her divorce from exwife linda thompson while they were dating;215xxx;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;5;1;1
she weaves this elaborate story about how she and linda broke up kris recalls;215xxx;1;5;1;1;1;1;5;1;1;1
cait couldve told me the story that she writes about in the book which is…linda got so angry and nasty that cait had to tell her about her gender dysphoria why wouldnt you have just told me what happened with linda so at least i could make my own decision if i wanted to get married to someone who really wanted to be a woman;215xxx;1;3;1;3;3;1;5;1;1;1
kim then chimes with her opinion;215xxx;1;5;1;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
she just literally started three families with three different people and fked everyone over she says;215xxx;1;5;1;1;1;1;5;1;1;1
100 percent kris states;215xxx;1;5;1;1;1;1;5;1;1;1
but she cant handle that negative publicity so im going to be the scapegoat shes going to throw me under the bus;215xxx;1;5;1;5;1;1;5;1;1;1

fka twigs and robert pattinson are reportedly going strong the twilight star and his fiancée attended the 2017 cannes film festival this week;219zzz;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;3;1;1
the couple didn’t look as happy as they are reported to be it’s been months since fans have seen fka twigs and robert pattinson together;219zzz;3;3;1;3;1;1;1;1;1;1
they keep their relationship lowkey for the most part;219zzz;3;3;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
it’s probably because fka twig has to deal with the crazy twilight fans bugging her on social media;219zzz;3;3;3;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
she looked really sour when they went to the redcarpet premiere of robert pattinson’s latest movie good time;219zzz;5;1;1;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
robert pattinson and fka twigs were glowing on the red carpet;219zzz;5;3;1;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
while robert pattinson seemed ecstatic to be there his girlfriend struggled to smile during the event;219zzz;5;3;1;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
fka twigs stood beside him in a busy dior gown that she paired her look with nude fuzzy boots and a black choker with a gold crucifix hanging from it;219zzz;1;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
the daily mail noticed that she kept looking at the floor as she walked out of their hotel to head to the screening robert pattinson kept it classic with his black tuxedo;219zzz;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;3;1;1

tdespite stepping out together at public events they rarely speak out about their relationship;219zzz;1;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
though fka twigs has said that the public attention that she has garnered is “100 percent worth it”;219zzz;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;5;1;1
she told the observer back in 2014 that she is not who she portrays on the red carpet;219zzz;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;5;1;1
she only attends these events to support “the man that i love”;219zzz;1;5;1;1;1;1;3;1;1;1
she also remarked about the media who scrutinizes every move on her red carpet;219zzz;1;5;1;0;1;1;1;3;1;1
fka twigs admits that she looks uncomfortable at red carpet events because they are not her thing;219zzz;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;3;1;1
but that doesn’t stop her from loving and supporting robert pattinson;219zzz;3;3;1;0;1;1;1;1;1;1

robert pattinson finally has successful movie  twilight curse over  celeb dirty laundry;227zzz;1;3;1;0;5;1;1;1;1;1
robert pattinson is elated at the success of his upcoming film “good time”;227zzz;1;5;1;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
the film premiered at cannes film festival and the movie and actor received a sixminute standing ovation;227zzz;1;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
there is also oscar buzz surrounding robert with some speculating he could receive a best actor nomination;227zzz;3;3;1;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
in the gritty crime film robert portrays a criminal named connie nikas who plans a bank heist with his brother robert toned down his usually good looks to the point of being unrecognizable and at one point he sported shaggy bleached blonde hair;227zzz;1;3;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
the star admitted that he was able to shoot scenes in new york without anyone knowing who he was;227zzz;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;5;1;1
when the film premiered recently at cannes not only did it receive a standing ovation there were audible cheers from audience members shouting “bravo” and many came up to robert to tell him what a great job he had done in the movie;227zzz;1;3;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
critics are also raving about the film which is a departure for robert who is used to being ripped by critics and having his films tank at the box office;227zzz;1;3;1;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
of course everyone knows robert’s big break came with the 2008 film “twilight” where he portrayed broody teenage vampire edward cullen and continued with the character for a total of four movies;227zzz;1;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
the “twilight” movies became a billion dollar franchise making robert a household name and the object of desire for teenage girls while he was paid millions to take on the role it pigeon holed him in hollywood and almost ruined his career;227zzz;1;3;1;3;1;1;1;1;1;1
for the past few year robert has starred in a string of box office duds including the sappy coming of age movie “remember me” and mostly forgettable indie films;227zzz;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
some wondered if he would ever see box office success again while some were quick to blame his faltering career on the “twilight curse”;227zzz;1;3;1;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
since the ending of the “twilight” and it’s sequels in 2012 most of the young stars from the movie have failed to see further success;227zzz;1;3;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
taylor lautner was supposed to become the next big action star but after the box office bomb “abduction” he disappeared from hollywood for years before returning to the small screen with “scream queens”;227zzz;1;1;1;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
other actors from the movie franchise nikki reed ashley greene kellan lutz and jackson rathbone have also had trouble finding success after “twilight” with each having a box office dud and now most are seen only in the occasional straighttodvd movie;227zzz;1;3;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
kristen stewart who portrayed bella has continued to work regularly although her career suffered a hiccup when it was revealed she had an affair with her married “snow white and the huntsman” director;227zzz;1;5;1;3;1;1;1;3;1;1
with the positive buzz surrounding his latest film i’m sure robert pattinson is glad his “twilight curse” appears to be over;227zzz;5;3;1;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
prince william and kate middleton moving out of kensington palace  celeb dirty laundry;236zzz;3;5;1;0;5;1;1;1;1;1
prince william and kate middleton are already thinking about moving out of kensington palace;236zzz;3;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
that’s because william doesn’t want his children prince george and princess charlotte to grow up behind palace walls;236zzz;3;3;3;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
instead he wants them to live a life out of the spotlight and as far away from the paparazzi as possible;236zzz;3;5;3;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
in his interview with british gq prince william said that the most important thing for him is knowing that prince george and princess charlotte will grow up in a happy stable secure world;236zzz;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;5;1;1
in other words he doesn’t want his kids to experience the same royal hustle and bustle that he had while growing up behind closed doors;236zzz;5;3;3;3;1;1;1;1;1;1
and while prince william and kate middleton haven’t fully moved in to kensington palace just yet they are already thinking about their next move;236zzz;3;3;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
apparently london is the last place that william wants to be with kate and their kids;236zzz;3;5;1;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
of course if prince william and kate middleton do end up moving from kensington palace royal observers wouldn’t be surprised;236zzz;3;3;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
it’s taken them this long to move back to london after having spent the last several years at anmer hall;236zzz;3;3;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
prince william has made it no secret that he doesn’t want his children to have the same childhood he had while growing up;236zzz;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;5;1;1
ideally the duke and duchess of cambridge would love to move back to anmer hall;236zzz;1;3;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
it was a gift given to them by queen elizabeth;236zzz;1;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
the property boasts a swimming pool and private tennis court and enough room for prince george and princess charlotte to run around in all day and night;236zzz;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
but of course for prince william this won’t be easy;236zzz;5;3;5;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
he can try and live a private life as much as he wants to but at the same time he is the future king of england;236zzz;5;5;3;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
prince george and princess charlotte are going to be in the spotlight whether he likes it or not;236zzz;5;3;5;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
and as much as he would love to return to anmer hall in the future it might not happen;236zzz;5;5;3;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
all of his royal responsibilities and engagements are in london that’s why many royal fans believe that sooner or later william will just have to suck up his feelings and do the job he was born to do;236zzz;3;3;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
in the meantime don’t forget to check back with cdl for all the latest news and updates on the royal family right here;236zzz;1;5;1;0;1;1;1;1;1;1

like i dont get it like i literally dont look like this;240xxx;1;5;1;1;1;1;5;1;1;1
speaking directly to the camera the 36yearold kuwtk star elaborated on her reaction;240xxx;1;3;1;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
im already having this anxiety attack over security and im already just like on high alert and now paparazzis found us its like just the scrutiny that we get all the time we try to avoid that she said;240xxx;1;5;1;1;1;1;5;1;1;1
im doing all the steps to try to be as private and discreet as possible and then you take pictures and if theyre not like perfect people just like bodyshame you  for people to just think thats ok is so frustrating;240xxx;1;3;1;3;1;1;5;1;1;1
kim then goes inside to untag herself in all the pictures that have been posted;240xxx;1;5;1;3;1;1;1;1;1;1
watch the clip which we first saw on e news below;240xxx;1;5;1;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
when the photos first appeared kim had a very different public reaction to the comments about the photos sending a bodypositive tweet that appeared to rise above the criticism she received;240xxx;1;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
although kims initial response was celebrated she was criticized for claiming that the pictures were photoshopped on the view in june in the same interview she said that the photos encouraged her to start working out more;240xxx;1;3;1;1;1;1;1;5;1;1
i saw these awful photos of myself when i was on a trip in mexico and people were photoshopping them and sharpening them and theyre the worst photos she said during her appearance on the tv show;240xxx;1;5;1;1;1;1;5;1;1;1
i definitely was not in my best shape i hadnt worked out in about 12 weeks;240xxx;1;5;1;3;1;1;5;1;1;1
she continued i was already not feeling like myself and then when people were like sharpening the photos and making them look way worse and then those were going around i was like ok im going to get it together;240xxx;1;5;1;5;1;1;5;1;1;1
of course photoshopped or not cellulite is a totally normal part of a womans body as for kims reaction to the pictures well have to wait until the next episode of kuwtk to see more;240xxx;5;3;3;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
keeping up with the kardashians airs sundays on e 9 pm et;240xxx;1;5;1;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
caitlyn jenners memoir reportedly lands movie adaptation rob lowe may play her;244zzz;1;5;1;0;1;1;1;3;1;1
report says that the how to be a latin lover actor is currently in talks to play the reality show star in a possible movie based on her new memoir the secrets of my life;244zzz;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;3;1;1
caitlyn jenner new memoir the secrets of my life reportedly will be adapted into a movie with how to be a latin lover actor rob lowe reportedly in talks to play her;244zzz;1;5;1;3;1;1;1;3;1;1
a source told ok that the actor would be interested to portray the olympianturnedtransgender reality show star;244zzz;1;3;1;1;1;1;1;5;1;1
rob’s been hunting for an awardscaliber movie part this would be a gamechanger for him a source told the magazine;244zzz;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;5;1;1
the insider went on saying that caitlyn had sent rob a copy of her book and that theyve met up a few times to discuss it;244zzz;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;5;1;1
the source added she thinks hes got what it takes to play both her and her former self bruce and now robs throwing his weight behind the project as well;244zzz;1;5;1;1;1;1;5;1;1;1
however gossip cop has learned that the report is simply not true;244zzz;1;5;1;3;1;1;1;3;1;1
a rep for rob tells the site that he hasnt met with the reality star to discuss a potential biopic;244zzz;1;5;1;1;1;1;5;1;1;1
caitlyn simply said in an interview that rob indeed would be a good choice to portray her in a potential film but the idea hasnt been brought into real life yet;244zzz;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;5;1;1
as for the memoir itself there hasnt been any official announcement whether or not it will be adapted into a movie;244zzz;3;5;1;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
caitlyns 320page memoir the secret of my life was published last april and chronicled her life as well as revealed some intriguing truths about her past;244zzz;1;5;1;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
one of them was the claim that her exwife kris jenner actually knew about her gender issue during their thenmarriage;244zzz;1;5;1;3;1;1;1;3;1;1
i tell kris about my gender issues before i make love to her wrote caitlyn;244zzz;1;5;1;1;1;1;5;1;1;1
this will always be a subject of dispute between kris and me as to how much she could intuit about my gender issues;244zzz;1;5;1;1;1;1;5;1;1;1
she insists that she was taken by surprise by my ultimate transition to caitlyni told her i dressed as a woman and she knew i did because i did it several times in front of her after we were married she claimed;244zzz;1;5;1;1;1;1;5;1;1;1
this is the new europe;694303711;5;5;1;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
terrorist attacks like these are not an aberration;694303711;5;3;3;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
theyre the new normal;694303711;5;3;1;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
and the new normal procedure is to bury them as crimes or just the random attacks of random madmen randomly shouting allahu akbar;694303711;5;3;5;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
a man shouting allahu akbar has stabbed two women to death with a butchers knife before being gunned down by soldiers in marseille;694303711;1;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
one woman was repeatedly stabbed in the stomach before were throat was slit while another woman was attacked from behind outside saint charles train station eyewitnesses of this afternoons attack told how a man dressed in black launched himself at the two women who screamed for their lives as others ran for safety;694303711;1;3;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
the assailant was quickly gunned down by police and soldiers who were on patrol inside the station at the time as part of frances ongoing state of emergency;694303711;1;3;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
antiterror officials said they were investigating links to a terrorist organisation and the attempted killing of a public official the identity of which is currently unknown;694303711;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;5;1;1
a police source said the suspect was known to authorities for common law crimes and analysis of their fingerprints came up with several aliases;694303711;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;5;1;1
nothing to do with islam;694303711;1;5;1;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
denial akbar;694303711;1;5;1;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
the authorities and or the media will label him a lone wolf but the tactics are quite familiar;694303711;3;3;3;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
muslim terrorist attacks have repeatedly targeted trains and buses;694303711;1;5;1;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
along with obviously planes;694303711;5;3;1;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
the use of a knife and or car second muslim weekend terrorist attack are also familiar staples of the current wave of islamic terror;694303711;5;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
meanwhile the new normal is soldiers patrolling french cities and shooting terrorists;694303711;3;3;1;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
but its not a war;694303711;5;5;1;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
its just the new normal;694303711;5;3;3;0;1;1;1;1;3;1
go back to shopping and welcome in refugees;694303711;5;1;3;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
the un;697129694;1;5;1;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
what would we do without it;697129694;1;5;1;0;5;1;1;1;1;1
the useless collective of dictatorships which cant find anything amiss in china russia iran zimbabwe or hell is always criticizing our human rights;697129694;5;1;3;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
this latest critique is particularly insane  un experts urged american lawmakers thursday to stop pushing undemocratic antiprotest legislation which they warned breached us and international law ensuring rights to freedom of expression and assembly;697129694;3;3;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
since the presidential election in november lawmakers in at least 19 us states have introduced bills to restrict the rights of protesters the united nations rights experts warned;697129694;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;3;1;1
and since january when president donald trump took office a number of undemocratic bills have been proposed in state legislatures with the purpose or effect of criminalising peaceful protests they said in a statement;697129694;1;5;1;1;1;1;3;1;1;1
by peaceful protests they mean those usual peaceful protest suddenly turned violent and led to the murder of eight police officers thirty bystanders and nine giraffes type of peaceful protests;697129694;1;3;3;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
the un insists that there is also a right to block traffic without being arrested;697129694;1;3;1;1;1;1;1;5;1;1
the experts pointed for instance to an indiana senate bill that would allow law enforcement to use any means necessary to clear the roads of people unlawfully obstructing vehicular traffic;697129694;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
i would be quite interested to see how tolerant the un would be of people blocking its personnel from driving in and out;697129694;5;3;1;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
they also balked at other legislation characterising protests as violent;697129694;1;3;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
there can be no such thing in law as a violent protest … only violent protesters who should be dealt with individually and appropriately by law enforcement they said;697129694;1;5;1;1;1;1;5;1;1;1
that explains how all these peaceful protests suddenly turn violent;697129694;5;5;3;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
a race riot is just a peaceful protest composed of violent protesters;697129694;5;3;5;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
personal liberty poll exercise your right to vote;701533995;3;3;1;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
president donald trump told republican senators this week that hes ready to make good on promises to kick off the uss withdrawal from the north american free trade agreement if mexico and canada arent willing to renegotiate the deal;701533995;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;5;1;3
during a private lunch with senators trump reportedly said he is ready to kick off the sixmonth process to shut nafta down;701533995;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;5;1;3
some lawmakers familiar with the conversation are reportedly worried about what the presidents plan will mean for us  agriculture;701533995;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
as reported by the hill  several senators expressed concerns about the strategy after the meeting particularly those with significant agriculture interests in their states;701533995;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;3;1;1
in response trump asked senators to stay with him as he works toward getting a better agreement;701533995;1;3;1;3;1;1;1;3;1;1
the president said  stick with me hes working on a good deal  said sen;701533995;1;5;1;1;1;1;5;3;1;1
deb fischer rneb;701533995;1;5;1;0;1;0;0;0;0;0
he said he would not let farmers down;701533995;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;5;1;1
sen chuck grassley riowa said he thinks trump is trying to give the united states a better chance to improve the agreement;701533995;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;5;1;3
i think the president is using all the leverage he can in public discussion to hopefully bring about changes that would have to take place  grassley said;701533995;1;5;1;1;1;1;5;1;1;3
hes positioning himself for the strongest position that he can;701533995;3;1;1;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
some lawmakers have expressed worries over the strategy however;701533995;1;3;1;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
senpat roberts rkann chairman of the senate agriculture committee told inside us;701533995;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;5;1;1
trade that even starting a withdrawal would be bad for us  agriculture;701533995;5;3;3;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
if trump starts the nafta withdrawal process congress is likely to act quickly to prop up the trade treaty;701533995;5;3;3;5;1;1;1;1;1;3
already lobbyists are flooding washington to ask lawmakers top preserve nafta;701533995;1;5;1;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
the new york times reported;701533995;1;5;1;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
isis has been beaten;703071951;1;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
its been forced out of city after city;703071951;1;5;1;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
its fighters are dying or have run away;703071951;1;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
its resources are exhausted;703071951;1;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
its over;703071951;5;5;1;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
and yet once again theres blood on the pavement and screams filling the air of a western city;703071951;3;3;1;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
and the note in the bloodied truck links the attack to isis;703071951;3;3;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
we didnt beat isis because its not just an army or an alliance;703071951;3;5;3;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
its an idea;703071951;5;5;5;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
the idea is islam;703071951;5;5;5;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
by declaring a caliphate isis made its existence interchangeable with islam and its manifest destiny;703071951;3;5;1;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
losing so many battles has weakened that identification but there are still plenty of muslims willing to kill for it;703071951;5;3;3;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
and it isnt because isis has radicalized them with some brilliant internet memes but because it promised to fulfill the ideas and beliefs of their religion;703071951;5;3;5;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
isis is popular because it appeared to have come closest to doing what no other islamic group had been able to do in a century resurrect the caliphate;703071951;5;3;5;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
isis was popular because it was islamic;703071951;5;3;5;0;1;3;1;1;1;1
it was popular to the degree that it was islamic;703071951;5;5;3;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
it was popular because it brought back islamic institutions from slavery to mutilating thieves without any apologies or concessions;703071951;5;1;3;0;1;3;1;1;1;1
that is the simple truth that our leaders refuse to deal with;703071951;5;3;5;0;1;3;1;1;1;1
what causes an uzbek immigrant along with pakistanis syrians iraqis afghans tunisians and american converts to islam to be willing to kill and die;703071951;3;5;1;0;5;1;1;1;1;1
they arent killing and dying for isis;703071951;5;5;5;0;1;1;1;1;3;1
but the ummah the global islamic tribe that embodies their honor for the virgins of paradise and for the cry that accompanied their atrocities;703071951;5;3;3;0;1;1;1;1;3;1
the cry of allahu akbar;703071951;3;5;1;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
and until we understand that we wont beat isis;703071951;5;5;5;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
because isis is islam;703071951;5;3;3;0;1;3;1;1;1;1
yesterday turkish hackers took down the times of israel web site for approximately six hours replacing its pages with antiisrael propaganda;704023030;1;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
the obvious joke is how could anyone tell the difference;704023030;5;1;1;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
but thats how yair rosenbergs piece at the tablet on the times of israel hack begins;704023030;5;3;3;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
but the piece largely laudatory toward the leftwing antiisrael site addresses the security risk and the resulting problems that its partner papers suffered in only the most cursory of ways;704023030;5;3;5;0;1;1;1;1;1;5
the key words there that should alert jewish readers are the jewish world;704023030;5;5;3;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
thats because the times of israel now plays host to an array of crucial jewish publications from around the globe;704023030;3;3;3;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
this has given these publications the advantage of a fastloading high quality user interface for their articles;704023030;5;1;3;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
but it has the disadvantage of tying the fate of these publications to a high value target for international hackers;704023030;5;3;3;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
thus when the times of israel went down so did new yorks jewish week new jerseys jewish standard britains jewish news the atlanta jewish times and the pittsburgh jewish chronicle;704023030;5;5;1;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
going forward as more and more local jewish media outlets transition to online only publishing we can expect more papers to partner with the times of israel;704023030;5;3;3;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
which means that the informational security of the times of israel is not simply an israeli issue its a jewish one;704023030;5;3;5;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
does the phrase too big to fail ring a bell;704023030;3;1;1;0;3;1;1;1;1;1
theres no reason for the times of israels flawed website to be a jewish issue;704023030;5;3;3;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
especially since the sites content often makes little secret of its loathing for jews;704023030;5;1;3;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
and this hack should serve as a wake up call for its partner publications;704023030;5;3;3;0;1;1;1;1;3;1
having a pretty page doesnt count for much if anyone can take it down;704023030;5;3;5;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
oh my  you know that the shark has been jumped when lefties start using russia as the defense for just about anything and everything;706277844;5;1;3;0;1;1;1;1;3;3
george takei a former star trek actor now best known as a creepy living internet meme decided to try the russia defense for the sexual assault allegations against him;706277844;1;1;1;5;1;1;1;1;3;1
if it worked for losing a presidential election why not an assault on a male model  a friend sent me this  it is a chart of what russian bots have been doing to amplify the stories containing the allegations against me  its clear they want to cow me into silence but do not fear friends  i wont succumb to that takei tweeted;706277844;1;3;1;1;5;1;5;1;1;1
has there ever been better evidence that the 240 character expansion is a mistake  then takei tried to claim that he had been attacked when he criticized putins antilgbt policies publicly;706277844;1;3;1;1;5;1;1;3;1;1
takeis stupid tweets which he since deleted make the same basic mistake as much of the media spin;706277844;5;1;5;0;1;1;1;1;3;1
russian bots no doubt are pushing up stories about takei;706277844;5;3;5;0;1;1;1;1;3;1
not because putin harbors a grudge for a guy whose entire existence is already a joke but because its a trending story;706277844;5;1;5;0;1;1;1;1;3;1
the whole point of these online influence operations is to be associated with popular material in order to slip in the stuff that russian intel really wants to get in there;706277844;5;1;3;0;1;1;1;1;3;1
and no thats not takei;706277844;5;5;5;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
bots go with trending topics because its the best way to build influence;706277844;5;3;5;0;1;1;1;1;3;1
takei has confused the chicken and the egg;706277844;3;1;1;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
and all he managed to was dig a deeper hole;706277844;3;1;1;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
another brutal murder by an illegal alien brought to you by supporters of open borders;708359966;3;3;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
the proillegal alien lobby claims that opposing open borders is racist;708359966;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;5;1;1
meanwhile their agenda got a latino border patrol agent brutally murdered as breitbart texas reports;708359966;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;5;1;1
border patrol agent brandon judd also president of the nbpc stated what we know is that border patrol agent rogilio martinez appears to have been ambushed by a group of illegal aliens whom he was tracking;708359966;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;5;1;1
our agents reports from the ground say that he was struck in the head multiple times with a rock or rocks;708359966;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;5;1;1
agent judd continued the other agent arrived on scene a short time later and was also ambushed and struck in the head with what is believed to have been a rock or rocks;708359966;1;5;1;3;1;1;1;3;1;1
these disgusting acts and complete disregard for human life need to stop immediately;708359966;5;1;5;0;1;1;1;1;5;1
family members of slain agent martinez will never get to see him come home again all because we have failed to secure our borders from such criminals;708359966;5;1;5;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
president trump has responded to the brutal murder by calling for the wall;708359966;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;5;3;1
president trump on sunday reiterated his calls to build a wall along the countrys southern border after a us;708359966;1;5;1;3;1;1;1;3;1;1
border patrol agent died from injuries he sustained on patrol in texas;708359966;1;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
border patrol officer killed at southern border another badly hurt trump tweeted;708359966;1;5;1;1;1;1;5;1;1;1
we will seek out and bring to justice those responsible  we will and must build the wall;708359966;1;3;3;1;1;1;5;1;3;1
we must;708359966;5;3;5;0;1;1;1;1;3;1
the question is will we do it;708359966;5;5;3;0;3;1;1;1;1;1
or will the open borders lobby continue to get its way;708359966;5;3;1;0;3;1;1;1;1;1
california governor jerry brown has issued pardons for hundreds of people in his state who are there illegally most with criminal backgrounds in an attempt to show the trump administration in particular that all illegals are welcome there;717988445;1;3;1;5;1;1;1;1;3;3
the only problem with browns pardons is they are themselves illegal;717988445;5;5;5;0;1;1;1;1;3;1
any governor of a state does not have the authority to pardon anyone who has committed a federal crime;717988445;3;5;3;0;1;1;1;1;3;1
in this case browns pardons are nothing more than useless symbolic gestures that mean absolutely nothing to the federal government;717988445;5;1;5;0;1;1;1;1;3;1
thus the individuals who have been pardoned by brown still face the same consequences of being rounded up detained and eventually deported as they did before by federal agencies;717988445;1;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;3;1
since brown declared his state a sanctuary state for illegals and state law enforcement from state police to local law enforcement agencies have a handsoff policy of checking anyones immigration status the situation for anyone here illegally basically has not changed;717988445;1;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
governor brown has been in california politics for several decades and is fully aware of his authority as governor;717988445;1;5;1;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
brown knows his executive pardons of those here illegally have no value under federal law and has chosen to use them as a tool of political pandering;717988445;5;3;3;0;1;1;1;1;3;5
unfortunately for brown and the people of california the political powers he is loyal to are no longer in authority in washington and with his state facing nearly a trillion dollar debt unemployment in double digits in some areas and one of the highest crime rates in the nation brown stands to lose big time;717988445;5;3;5;0;1;1;1;1;3;3
the popular idea in foreign policy circles these days is that china can be pressured into cutting off north korea;718429117;3;3;3;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
and that will force the norks to cut a deal;718429117;5;3;1;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
ive said before that the idea is wishful thinking;718429117;5;3;3;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
no matter how unstable the norks appears theyre quite useful to china as a proxy for destabilizing any american order;718429117;5;3;3;0;0;1;1;1;1;1
and focusing our threat awareness away from china;718429117;5;3;1;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
and so that special relationship isnt going anywhere;718429117;5;3;3;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
china may rebuke the norks in public;718429117;5;5;3;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
but theyll keep on backing them in private;718429117;5;3;1;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
as this latest revelation shows;718429117;1;5;1;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
us  spy satellites reportedly captured photos of chinese ships illegally selling oil to north korean boats some 30 times since october;718429117;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
satellite images released by the us  department of treasury appeared to show vessels from both countries illegally trading oil in the west sea the chosun ilbo reported tuesday citing south korean government sources;718429117;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;5;1;1
while russia exports some oil to north korea china is the main source of oil for the rogue nation according to reuters;718429117;1;3;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
however the country exported no oil products to the north during the month of november;718429117;1;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
it was reportedly the second consecutive month china didnt export diesel or gasoline to north korea;718429117;1;5;1;3;1;1;1;1;1;1
reportedly would be the key word there;718429117;1;5;1;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
plausible deniability would be more accurate;718429117;5;5;3;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
china and the norks have extensive business connections that are profitable to elites in both countries;718429117;3;3;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
and they both need each other for political reasons;718429117;5;5;3;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
so china will go on keeping north korea afloat;718429117;5;3;3;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
and it can always blame rogue figures;718429117;5;3;1;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
and maybe even use the latest revelations to dispose of some figures who have fallen out of favor by serving them up as scapegoats;718429117;5;3;3;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
what it wont do is cut the norks off;718429117;5;5;3;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
httpswwwlewrockwellcomlrcblogtrumpmovingtowardfullneoconiran  we already knew that trump  neocon on iran;719432350;1;5;1;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
we are now seeing that position being fleshed out;719432350;5;3;5;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
trump wants more sanctions;719432350;3;3;3;5;1;1;1;1;1;3
he wants the nuclear agreement nullified;719432350;3;3;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;3
he wants an excuse to nullify it;719432350;3;3;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;3
he wants regime change in iran;719432350;3;3;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;5
the state department is considering the sanctions;719432350;3;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;3
steps are being taken to rally the usual sock puppet allies of the us  against iran;719432350;1;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;5
these steps are parts of a plan in my view of which currently secret unreported and unknown steps by the us;719432350;5;3;5;0;1;1;1;1;3;1
to foster protests were a crucial part;719432350;5;1;3;0;1;1;1;1;3;1
i think as time passes information will be leaked and dribble out or be uncovered by sharp reporters that will show that critical parts of what is happening in iran are not spontaneous and not accidental;719432350;5;1;5;0;1;1;1;1;3;1
full neocon on iran means war against iran;719432350;5;3;5;0;1;1;1;1;3;3
trump isnt there;719432350;1;5;3;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
hell be happy for now if he scuttles the nuclear agreement and starves iran of resources;719432350;5;1;5;0;1;1;1;1;1;3
hell hurt the iranian people;719432350;5;1;5;0;1;1;1;1;3;1
hes moving in the war direction however;719432350;5;1;5;0;1;1;1;1;3;3
clashes in syria of american forces against iranian and hezbollah forces can become part of this motion;719432350;5;5;5;0;1;1;1;1;1;5
remember hes kept those forces there and beefed them up;719432350;5;3;5;0;1;1;1;1;3;1
if trump tastes the power to repress and thinks it successful this will whet his appetite for more grandiose military moves;719432350;5;1;5;0;1;1;1;1;3;5
at least thats what his rhetoric against north korea and his open love for the us  military and its deadly toys both suggest;719432350;5;1;5;0;1;1;1;1;3;3
he has drones assassinations computer worms and financial freezes in his arsenal;719432350;3;3;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1

talibanlinked insurgents lured the us  military to a meeting and then opened fire wounding a us  soldier but earning the wrath of a coalition airstrike in response;722512329;1;3;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
the insurgents lured a us  soldier an afghan militia leader and afghan interpreter to a socalled security meeting on thursday according to us  navy capt  tom gresback;722512329;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;5;1;1
as soon as the meeting finished the insurgents disguised as members of a local militia opened fire immediately killing the militia leader and wounding the us  soldier the associated press reports;722512329;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;5;1;1
the soldier is in stable condition;722512329;1;5;1;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
the taliban told the associated press that it had infiltrated the militia months ago in preparation for the attack;722512329;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;5;1;1
not long after the attack took place the us led coalition struck the insurgent compound in nangarhar province killing 10 insurgents in retribution;722512329;1;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
more specifically the mission took place in mohmand valley;722512329;1;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
afghan residents have started to relocate back to this area after being forced out in 2015 by the islamic state of khorasan;722512329;1;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
the pentagon is planning on sending an extra 1000 combat advisers to the region as well as new armed and unarmed drones in preparation for the fighting season that begins in the spring;722512329;1;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
its possible to send more military hardware to afghanistan due to drawdowns in iraq and syria in response to the rapid decline of isis us  officials told the wall street journal;722512329;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;5;1;1
however there is consternation from us  military planners about resource shifting as they dont want an insurgency to restart in iraq and syria;722512329;3;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1

freedom of the press dies in darkness;723681425;5;3;1;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
we get a lot of lectures about freedom of the press these days;723681425;5;5;1;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
senator flake just put on his best acting moccasins and pounded the pulpit about it;723681425;5;3;1;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
but the press isnt free;723681425;5;5;1;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
its an ideological network that exists to push its political narratives while silencing the political opposition;723681425;5;3;3;0;1;1;1;1;1;3
and yes that includes other reporters;723681425;5;5;3;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
heres the latest from the resistance paper owned by the richest man in the country the washington post;723681425;1;3;1;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
staffers at the hill press management about the work of john solomon  washington post  heres wapo openly naming and smearing an investigative journalist in its headline as part of an effort to get him fired;723681425;3;5;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
why;723681425;1;5;1;0;5;1;1;1;1;1
because of his reporting on uranium one and other scandals including the attempts to pay trump accusers to come forward;723681425;3;3;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
theres frustration that solomon appears so tight with hannity the primetime trump apologist who has admitted straightup that hes no journalist erik wemple writes;723681425;1;5;1;1;1;1;5;1;1;1
im sure that wapo would be equally energized about a reporter keeping company with stephen colbert or michael moore;723681425;5;1;3;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
wemple and the post are targeting the hill to shut down investigative journalism unfavorable to their political movement;723681425;5;1;3;0;1;1;1;1;1;3
im sure senator flake will be giving a speech about that right around never;723681425;5;3;3;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
but this is why in a nutshell we dont have a free press;723681425;5;3;5;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
we have a series of leftist media conglomerates that create echo chambers;723681425;5;1;3;0;1;1;1;1;1;3
when reporters do actual work they get targeted and shut down;723681425;5;5;3;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
ask sharyl attkisson;723681425;3;5;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0
anyone who sincerely wants to defend freedom of the press should call out the washington post attack for what it is a smear campaign aimed at a reporter whose exposes hurt the left;723681425;5;1;5;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
goldman sachs ceo lloyd blankfein says the us;731564259;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;5;1;1
economy is performing better under president donald trump than it would be if hillary clinton had been elected;731564259;3;3;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;3
if the president didnt win and hillary clinton won ‚ä¶ i bet you the economy is higher today than it otherwise would be  blankfein told cnn money;731564259;1;3;1;1;1;1;1;3;1;3
the wall street executive a clinton supporter during the 2016 election said hes changed his mind about trumps economic prowess after witnessing changes over the past several months;731564259;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;5;1;1
at the time i supported hillary clinton;731564259;5;5;1;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
were not talking about all things;731564259;3;5;1;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
were talking just about the economy  he said;731564259;1;5;1;3;1;1;3;1;1;1
still blankfein said americans should remain on the lookout for an economic downturn especially if trumps efforts overheat the economy while growing the federal deficit;731564259;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;5;1;1
the odds of a bad outcome have gone up  blankfein said;731564259;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;5;1;1
unlike democrat politicians who called onetime 1000 bonuses handed out to workers at many firms thanks to trumps tax cuts the wall street insider said the extra money matters because it gives workers hope for a brighter economic future;731564259;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;5;1;1
i think a lot of it is symbolic and making a statement  he said;731564259;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;5;1;1
were dealing in a world of sentiment;731564259;5;3;3;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
symbolism matters;731564259;3;3;3;0;1;1;1;1;3;1
the ceo also urged lawmakers to lay aside poison politics  and work with the administration toward further economic improvements;731564259;1;3;1;1;1;1;1;3;1;1
so everyone goes to congress and gets nothing done  blankfein said;731564259;1;5;1;1;1;1;3;3;1;1
would we have a country if people went to philadelphia to form the continental congress that way of course not;731564259;5;3;5;0;5;1;1;1;1;1
its crazy;731564259;5;1;3;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
attorney general jeff sessions is encouraging federal prosecutors to begin seeking the death penalty in certain drug cases;740854504;1;3;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
civil liberty advocates say the move may not actually result in executions but will likely lead to an overall increase in length of sentences for drug offenses;740854504;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;5;1;1
sessions called on prosecutors to consider every lawful tool at their disposal  including the death penalty in prosecuting drug cases;740854504;1;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
under a 1994 law prosecutors have the power to seek the death penalty in drug cases  but it has never been used;740854504;1;3;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
as politico explained  signed by president bill clinton the 1994 death penalty statute was part of a clampdown on drug dealers in response to the crack epidemic linked to a surge of crime and violence in american cities in the 1980s and 1990s;740854504;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;5;1;1
but it was a bridge too far even for zealous prosecutors because many believed it would be found to violate the eighth amendment prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment said ojmarrh mitchell a professor of statistics and criminology at the university of south florida;740854504;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;5;1;1
in the absence of a direct link to a death the constitutionality of death penalty prosecution is shaky at best  said douglas berman a law professor at ohio state university;740854504;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;5;1;1
the 1994 legislative package authorizes capital punishment against a defendant who directs a continuing criminal enterprise involving either large quantities of drugs or generating 20 million a year from the enterprise;740854504;1;5;1;3;1;1;1;1;1;1
it also includes 20year mandatory minimum sentences for drug sales that result in overdose deaths;740854504;1;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
it has been used to execute drug kingpins for murders committed in the course of their business;740854504;1;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
reason magazines mike riggs notes that prosecutors are unlikely to seek the death penalty but the move will result in heftier prison sentences;740854504;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;5;1;1

therein weigel wrote of a panel jason richwine was on to discuss mark krikorians thennew book the new case against immigration where richwine spoke very frankly about race and iq;761672855;1;3;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
but weigel incorrectly wrote  even richwine added some caveats;761672855;3;3;5;3;1;1;1;3;1;1
i point out that ayaan hirsi ali was given an iq test in the netherlands and did very poorly  he said;761672855;1;3;1;1;1;1;1;3;1;1
its hard to imagine someone brighter;761672855;5;1;3;0;1;1;1;1;3;1
but richwine did not say that;761672855;1;5;1;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
fellow panellist fred siegel did;761672855;1;5;1;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
see for yourself by going to the 4930 mark of cspans recording of the event;761672855;1;5;1;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
july 3 2008  weigels piece was never corrected which is a shame as weigel is generally an able and honest journalist;761672855;5;1;3;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
for the record fred siegel though generally bright was is wrong about this;761672855;5;3;5;0;3;3;1;1;1;1
it is quite easy to imagine someone brighter than ayaan hirsi ali indeed siegel himself is clearly brighter;761672855;5;1;5;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
ali is famous simply she is a nonwhite woman who will reiterate neocon talking points about islam not because she is bright;761672855;5;1;5;0;1;1;1;1;3;1
what is something insightful she said that has not been said by other less organically politically correct critics of islam;761672855;3;1;3;0;5;1;1;1;1;1

theres the split between israeli and american jews in a nutshell;763250377;3;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
just 46 percent of american jews supported us president donald trumps relocation of the us embassy in israel from tel aviv to jerusalem while 47 percent opposed the move;763250377;1;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;3
within israel an overwhelming 85 percent of israeli jews supported the embassys move to jerusalem while only 7 percent disapproved;763250377;1;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;3
israeli jews have a favorable view of trump with 77 percent approving of his handling of usisrael relations and only 10 percent disapproving;763250377;1;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;3
by contrast within the united states 34 percent of american jews approve of his handling of usisrael relations and 57 percent disapproving;763250377;1;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;3
overall 71 percent of american jews disapprove of president trump while only 26 percent have a positive opinion of the president;763250377;1;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;3
the figure is has improved since the last poll in which 77 percent disapproved and 21 percent approved of the president;763250377;1;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
note i corrected the storys figures based on the ajc poll;763250377;5;5;1;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
its an improvement;763250377;5;3;5;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
but not the kind that will blow anyones mind;763250377;5;1;5;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
three points though;763250377;3;5;1;0;1;1;1;1;0;0
1 trumps popularity keeps being underwater even while people support his policies;763250377;3;1;3;0;1;1;1;1;1;3
and so despite the polls he keeps winning;763250377;1;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
plenty of people who wouldnt say they support him vote for him anyway;763250377;3;3;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
2 american jews are undergoing a demographic change with protrump religious jews on the way to becoming the new majority within a generation;763250377;3;1;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;3
its these jews whom trump has been targeting;763250377;5;1;3;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
and theyre quite happy with him;763250377;1;1;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
thats the long game;763250377;5;1;3;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
3 for israelis their country is a priority;763250377;3;5;1;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
for many american jews israel isnt;763250377;3;5;1;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
truly weve hit peak kidsploitation;766835964;5;3;5;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
senator menendez d  nj was accused of a variety of crimes including cavorting with underage prostitutes in the dominican republic;766835964;1;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
prosecutors used the defense claims to highlight previously undisclosed tidbits on menendezs pursuit of younger woman;766835964;1;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
the lawyers say their investigation resulted from speci?§c corroborated allegations that defendants menendez and melgen had sex with underage prostitutes in the dominican republic;766835964;1;5;1;1;1;1;5;1;1;1
menendezs camp said monday that the justice department ?§ling is a smear tactic designed to use the exchange of motions to dump dirt on the senator;766835964;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;5;3;3
menendez was found not guilty by a jury;766835964;1;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
the dems stuck by him and now hes going full kidsploitation;766835964;3;3;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
menendez railed that trump must stop tearing babies from their mothers arms  as he displayed a photo of a young child crying as her mother interacted with a border patrol agent;766835964;1;3;1;1;1;1;1;5;3;3
they say a picture is worth a thousand words but the audio released yesterday by propublica is worth a million tears  menendez said;766835964;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;5;3;1
how do you submit the cries of innocent children into the congressional record;766835964;1;3;1;0;5;1;1;1;1;1
i dont know how you do that but you can hear it;766835964;5;3;1;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
the photo he displayed featured the same child president trump was seen towering over on the cover of liberal time magazine;766835964;1;3;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
the photo was more fake news the child had not been separated from her mother;766835964;5;3;5;5;1;1;1;1;5;1
but how do you submit hollow grandstanding into the public record;766835964;3;3;1;0;5;1;1;1;1;1
i dont know how you do that but if you have the stomach for it you can listen to a hack doing just that;766835964;5;3;5;0;1;1;1;1;3;1
bernie sanders is a courageous truthteller who isnt afraid of anyone and tells it like it is;769288145;5;5;3;0;1;1;1;1;3;1
thats if you believe the media and his fan base;769288145;3;5;1;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
in reality bernie is a little man who lives in fear of his own sandernistas;769288145;3;5;3;0;1;1;1;1;3;1
whenever he steps out of line they whack him until he gets back into line;769288145;3;5;3;0;1;1;1;1;3;1
in a vox interview bernie sanders rejected open borders as a koch plan that would devalue american workers;769288145;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;5;3;1
a little slapping quickly brought him around into line;769288145;5;3;3;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
he was skeptical on gun control;769288145;3;3;3;0;1;1;1;1;3;1
then he was slapped into line;769288145;3;3;1;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
he suggested that israel might have a right to defend itself against hamas;769288145;1;5;1;5;1;1;1;5;1;1
and was slapped into line;769288145;3;1;1;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
he was a little tentative about black lives matters and was slapped into line;769288145;3;3;1;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
this time around he was slow to adopt the lefts latest destroy ice position;769288145;3;3;1;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
and the left rounded on him;769288145;5;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;5
and now as all the previous times he loudly reversed himself;769288145;3;3;1;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
and adopted the lefts position at twice the volume;769288145;1;3;1;5;1;1;1;1;3;1
bernie sanders ver  12 is for open borders gun control hamas drug dealers and yes abolishing ice;769288145;1;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;3;1
and hes so loud and obnoxious about it or whoever runs his twitter account is that you would never know that he once had a different opinion;769288145;5;1;5;0;1;1;1;1;3;1
because bernie the 1 with the three houses is a hypocrite and a coward;769288145;5;1;5;0;1;1;1;1;3;1
hes not a courageous truthteller but the guy riding a golden lefty money train and getting his stepkids on board;769288145;5;1;5;0;1;1;1;1;3;1
he has no integrity no courage and no principles;769288145;5;1;5;0;1;1;1;1;3;1
the real bernie is a coward;769288145;5;1;5;0;1;1;1;1;5;1

the imbroglio began when senator kamala harris tweeted that two decades after brown v  board i was only the second class to integrate at berkeley public schools  without that decision i likely would not have become a lawyer and eventually be elected a senator from california;772123063;1;5;1;1;1;1;5;1;1;1
without that decision i likely would not have become a lawyer and eventually be elected a senator from california;772123063;3;5;3;0;1;1;3;1;1;1
harris appeared to have actually grown up in montreal she certainly attended high school there according to this canadian article she had been living there since the mid 70s;772123063;1;3;1;1;1;1;1;3;1;1
harris was born in 1964;772123063;1;3;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
and as many have pointed out berkeley schools had been desegregated long before;772123063;1;3;3;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
the media quickly jumped in to protect their candidate by insisting that until busing began berkeley schools were segregated;772123063;1;3;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;3
or as factcheck put it effectively segregated;772123063;1;3;1;1;1;1;1;1;0;1
this is dishonest goal post shifting;772123063;5;1;5;0;1;1;1;1;3;1
and if we utilize that measure then we still have segregation in america today;772123063;5;1;5;0;1;3;1;1;5;1
that is actually what the left claims;772123063;3;5;3;0;1;1;1;1;3;5
but its not how people understand segregation;772123063;5;3;3;0;1;3;1;1;1;1
if we view nonracially diverse areas as segregated then we still have segregation;772123063;5;5;5;0;1;1;1;1;3;1
however most people read harris claim as referring to an official policy of racial segregation;772123063;1;5;1;3;1;1;1;1;3;3
her claim appears to be false;772123063;3;1;3;5;1;1;1;1;5;1
and the medias defenses of it misleading and dishonest;772123063;5;1;3;5;1;1;1;1;3;1
kamala harris attended high school in canada;772123063;1;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
berkeley schools were not racially segregated when she attended them;772123063;1;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
her attempts to selfdramatize her own halfblack racial background for political gain are cynical;772123063;3;1;3;0;1;1;1;1;3;1
harris grew up in a middle class black neighborhood and in canada being raised by a nonblack mother;772123063;1;5;1;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
shes not oppressed but very privileged;772123063;5;1;3;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
and its time she admitted that;772123063;5;3;3;0;1;1;1;1;3;1
its 730 pm;775640697;1;5;1;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
that means its time for the original fake news journalist from central casting to take a deep breath adjust his girdle and pretend to be a serious thinker again;775640697;5;1;5;0;1;1;1;1;3;1
live from whatever media dumpster hes working at now its dan rather;775640697;5;1;1;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
veteran journalist dan rather said on friday that president trumps false statements about and attacks on the media are straight out of orwell;775640697;1;3;1;1;1;1;1;5;1;1
the former longtime cbs news anchor told cnns don lemon that trump is authoritarian  and wants people to believe that the one and only truth comes from him;775640697;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;5;1;5
george orwell what he wrote its practically a shooting script for donald trump  rather said referencing the dystopian author;775640697;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;5;1;1
there is a method to this and the method is to convince people that the only truth is the truth that comes from me the ultimate power;775640697;5;1;5;0;1;1;1;1;3;1
1 thats not what orwell was writing about;775640697;5;3;5;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
doublethink is nearly the opposite of that;775640697;5;3;5;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
1984 was not a world in which the leaders held the absolute truth but one in which they eradicated the very notion of an objective truth;775640697;5;1;5;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
but dan rather was always a posturing buffoon who like the rest of his colleagues pretends to know what hes talking about when he doesnt even have clue one;775640697;5;1;5;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
2  if anyone is orwellian here its the fake but accurate jorno whose attempt to peddle a bush bashing story using vietnam war era documents produced in microsoft word was somehow spun into a tale of martyrdom titled truth;775640697;5;1;5;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
luckily the left learned to love big media;775640697;5;1;1;0;1;1;1;1;1;5
in san antonio today united states district judge xavier rodriguez sentenced texas mexican mafia tmm members jesse santibanez and alfredo cardona to life in federal prison for their roles in the murder of a  crooked balcones heights police officer julian pesina in 2014 federal officials announced today;779716310;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;5;1;1

on november 9 2017 judge rodriguez sentenced 38yearold former tmm sergeant jerry idrogo to 20 years in federal prison after he pleaded guilty to a racketeering conspiracy charge that included pesinas murder;779716310;1;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
another tmm member ruben reyes aka menace  pleaded guilty in july 2016 to similar charges that included this murder and four others;779716310;1;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
reyes is currently serving five consecutive lifeimprisonment sentences;779716310;1;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
evidence presented during trial revealed that acting upon an order by reyes santibanez and cardona murdered pesina on may 4 2014 in front of his business the notorious ink tattoo and piercing studio located on hillcrest drive;779716310;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;3;1;1
testimony during trial revealed that pesina had claimed membership in the tmm was selling narcotics and paying the dime  the 10 street tax to the tmm when the tmm learned that pesina was a balcones heights police officer;779716310;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;5;1;1
on may 4 2014 idrogo contacted pesina and arranged for pickup of the dime  outside of pesinas tattoo shop;779716310;1;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
just before meeting pesina idrogo dropped off santibanez and cardona on the side of the building;779716310;1;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
once pesina walked up to the car and handed idrogo the dime  payment money santibanez and cardona came around the corner and shot and killed pesina;779716310;1;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1

leaders to protect their secrets and go after assange has nothing to do with their mantra of national security;784855236;3;5;3;3;1;1;1;1;1;3
the purpose is not to protect national security but to protect the asses of the people who wrote the directives  of classified material most of which should never have been classified ellsberg said;784855236;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;5;1;1
cypherpunks freedom a… julian assange best price 878 buy new 1062 as of 1050 est  details ellsberg 87 said that as a publisher and journalist the espionage act cannot be applied to assange as it should not have been applied to ellsberg for nonspying activities when he released the pentagon papers revealing that the us  government long knew it was losing the vietnam war but continued lying to the american public;784855236;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;5;1;3
julian is not a whistle blower per se but a facilitator of whistleblowing  ellsberg said ‚ä¶the point being that as a journalist he can not fairly be tried under the espionage act;784855236;1;5;3;1;1;1;1;5;1;1
as one who only received classified material and published it it is essential that julian assange not be indicted be convicted or be extradited to the united states  ellsberg said;784855236;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;5;1;1

gay illegal alien mexican murderer gets 16 years to life is not how a local paper in santa barbara reports that a mexican national drew a lengthy prison term after he pleaded guilty to second degree murder;804118111;3;3;1;1;1;1;1;3;1;1

kristen stewart drops twilight movie plans with robert pattinson lands new role in underwater thriller  celeb dirty laundry;010zzz;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
it looks like kristen stewart wont have any time on her hands to make another twilight movie with robert pattinson in the near future;010zzz;5;5;1;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
in fact new reports indicate that the hollywood star has just landed a new role in the psychological thriller underwater;010zzz;1;5;1;3;1;1;1;3;1;1
according to deadline the film is about an underwater scientific crew that struggle to survive after an earthquake;010zzz;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;5;1;1
kristen will star as noah a woman who ends up in a relationship with another crewmember;010zzz;1;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;3;1
and while there have been reports suggesting that kristen might reunite with her exboyfriend robert pattinson for another twilight film at this point it doesnt look like its going to happen;010zzz;3;5;1;3;1;1;1;1;1;1
then again many fans believe that one of the reasons why there will never be another twilight movie made again is because robert pattinson doesnt want to work with kristen stewart again;010zzz;1;5;1;0;1;1;1;1;3;1
after all she absolutely humiliated him right before their breakup in 2012;010zzz;5;3;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
robert was devastated when he found out that kristen was having a secret affair with director rupert sanders behind his back his trust issues with kristen would make it hard for the two to ever work together again;010zzz;5;3;1;5;1;1;1;1;3;1
plus robert pattinson has moved on with fka twigs;010zzz;5;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;3;1
he doesnt want to deal with the tabloid media and even more unnecessary rumors about his personal life meanwhile kristen is dating model stella maxwell;010zzz;3;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;3;1
the last thing robert wants is to be involved in a messy and complicated love triangle with his ex and his current girlfriend;010zzz;3;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;3;1
he wants to concentrate on his hollywood career and not the gossip magazines that write about his love life;010zzz;3;3;1;5;1;1;1;1;3;1
but for kristen stewart she doesnt feel that way;010zzz;5;5;1;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
she loves the attention she gets whenever her name is in the headlines;010zzz;5;5;1;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
she even mentioned earlier this month that she would be open to filming another twilight movie if the script and timing were both right;010zzz;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1;3;1
she even told reporters that she would be the first person to read it too;010zzz;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
what do you think of kristens new role in underwater;010zzz;5;5;1;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
does this mean that shes putting her twilight days behind her for good;010zzz;5;5;1;0;1;1;1;1;1;1

justin bieber pokes fun at himself after stepping out with an wet mark;024zzz;3;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
accidents happen but this star is not sorry about it;024zzz;5;1;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
justin bieber happily made a joke at his own expense after stepping out with a big wet patch on his pants the day before;024zzz;3;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
the 23yearold shared an instagram of himself and adam sandlers character billy madison on thursday to fess up to peeing in his pants;024zzz;1;3;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
just a few hours after pictures of the star surfaced of him with an unfortunate stain on his crotch area justin posted a picture of himself next to a screen grab from the movie billy madison;024zzz;1;3;1;1;1;1;1;3;1;1
using a quote from a scene in the 1995 movie justin captioned the sidebyside image you aint cool unless you pee your pants;024zzz;1;5;1;1;1;1;5;1;1;1
in the popular comedy adams character  an adult man force to return to school to prove he can run his fathers business  pretends to pee his pants so that one of his school friends does not get made fun of for actually peeing his pants;024zzz;1;1;1;3;1;1;1;1;1;1
the pee or not pee drama all started after the 24yearold was seen in west hollywood california with a giant wet patch on the front of his sweats;024zzz;3;3;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
the sorry stars stain covered his entire crotch area and was rather visible in his almost 700 grey vetements sweatpants;024zzz;5;1;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
the star ignored both the wet patch and a cameraman who constantly asked him about his ex selena gomezs new relationship with the weeknd;024zzz;1;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
justin made a beeline for his matte black range rover which he has had the badge changed on so it says stealth rover;024zzz;3;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
while in too much of a hurry to check his crotch area justin was not in too much of a hurry to grab a healthy juice;024zzz;5;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
obviously unperturbed by walking around in wet pants the platinum blond singer then headed to earthbar;024zzz;5;3;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
there he fueled up on a green juice and walked along one of the areas busiest streets without a wet patch care in the world;024zzz;5;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
aside from his stained designer sweatpants justin wore a white tshirt with a distressed grey jean jacket and a pair of nike air huarache;024zzz;1;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
as is his style these days the baby hitmaker added a pair of clear lens glasses;024zzz;3;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
justin did ditch his stained pants later to head to church late that night;024zzz;3;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
it was fortunate he opted for jeans as rumored on and off again love interest kourtney kardashian was also there;024zzz;3;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;3;1
there was also no missing kourt with the 37yearold wearing a sheer braflashing top to the religious service;024zzz;3;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;3;1
kourtney and the much younger pop star have been linked since 2015 but neither have confirmed if they are romantic or just good friends;024zzz;3;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;3;1

according to some source the duo was pretty together most of times which helped in birth of affair rumour;026zzz;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;5;1;1
this news was no new for chris and jenny while it seriously hit his wife faris;026zzz;3;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1

when the news spread she wanted it to go off as it was hurting her heart;026zzz;1;3;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
although this rumour spread all over internet and media it finally turned off when jennifer herself denied the news;026zzz;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;5;1;1
moreover she also stated being jealous of this wonderful loving couple;026zzz;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;5;1;1

further she also exclaimed about no guys asking her out;026zzz;1;5;1;5;1;1;1;5;1;1
although it is shocking to know about being no one to be with her every saturday we know that she once secretly dated nicholas hoult and chris martin;026zzz;5;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;3;1
as of 2016 she was alleged being linked up with darren aronofsky;026zzz;1;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;3;1
going to the dating history of chris pratt he dated only two girls in his lifetime;026zzz;1;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
in the year 2004 chris was linked with emily vancamp;026zzz;3;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
the couple were together for two years and then split in the year 2006;026zzz;1;5;1;0;1;1;1;1;1;1

ben and jen took a family vacation with other family friends an insider tells e news;229xxx;1;5;1;1;1;1;5;1;1;1
there was never any question that ben would be there all the dads went along and it would have been strange for the kids not to have their dad there;229xxx;1;5;1;0;1;1;5;1;1;1
if bakers bay sounds familiar thats because its the same caribbean island the family visited after they announced their separation in 2015 but theyve been going there for years even before that;229xxx;5;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
of course with the vacation comes plenty of speculation regarding their relationship status;229xxx;5;5;1;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
however our insider confirms they are not getting back together at all they are both moving on but will continue doing things together as a family;229xxx;5;5;1;1;1;1;5;1;3;1
were told ben wasnt there the entire time rather he came for a few days toward the end of the trip;229xxx;5;5;1;3;1;1;1;3;3;1
as for the getaway another source dished they stayed in the same house they always stay at its beachfront and beautiful its an annual tradition for them when the kids get out of school to come for a long vacation its very relaxing and they can feel like theyre on island time with nowhere to go and nobody they need to see;229xxx;1;5;1;1;1;1;5;1;1;1
so what did they do;229xxx;5;5;1;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
our insider added the kids spent a lot of time on the beach swimming and playing in the sand with their friends they also swam in the pool at the house and visited the club ben and jen both worked out at the gym daily;229xxx;5;5;1;1;1;1;5;1;1;1
the former couple has always been very vocal that coparenting their three children is their no1 priority and they will remain united as a team to do so;229xxx;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;5;1;1
we are definitely a modern family jen told today last summer;229xxx;1;5;1;1;1;1;5;1;1;1
you dont have a choice she added admitting that while their new normal might look unusual to some theyre actually doing really well;229xxx;1;5;1;1;1;1;5;1;1;1
ben reiterated that statement when he told e news jen is a superhero mom she is an amazing mother and im really lucky to have her as a partner to coparent these kids with we try our best we put them first and thats what we do;229xxx;1;5;1;1;1;1;5;1;1;1

there are no two sides to bigotry and hate”;232xxx;1;1;1;0;1;1;5;1;1;1

has rob kardashian found a new boo in bad girls club alum mehgan james;235xxx;5;5;1;0;1;1;1;1;3;1
media outlets began reporting last week that rob and mehgan were in the early stages in their relationship with an anonymous insider telling in touch robs been seeing mehgan james for almost three months and most of the kardashians are very upset about it because mehgan is known for being out of control and volatile the kardashians want rob to find a woman who is kind and calm;235xxx;1;3;1;1;1;1;5;1;3;1
shortly after the story began to gain traction rob denied even knowing who mehgan was writing on social media wait reading online about some chick im dating megan something not true never even met her or heard of her before;235xxx;1;5;1;1;1;1;5;1;1;1
after retweeting robs twitter statement mehgan later addressed the rumors on her instagram page writing before any of you start defaming my character im clearly not dating rob nor have i ever confirmed that i was you all just so happen to believe everything you read;235xxx;1;5;1;1;1;1;5;1;1;1
i posted one pair of arthur george socks 23 weeks ago  now all of a sudden im a homewrecker a fraud a hoe she continued;235xxx;1;1;1;1;1;1;5;1;1;1

im just megan something that most of you never heard of she went on referencing robs tweet;235xxx;1;5;1;1;1;1;5;1;1;1
i dont have that type of power i was just as confused as everyone else and was told not to even entertain it;235xxx;1;5;1;1;1;1;5;1;1;1
but heres where it gets interesting tmz reports that james was actually the one behind the rumors;235xxx;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;5;5;1

mehgan then slammed that story on instagram too writing i did not fake anything like i said i never confirmed that i was dating rob any one that asked i told them it was not true and not to mention the media is trying to make me look like the villain here when they are the ones who pieced together a story with no receipts it takes two people to fake a relationship any one who fakes a relationship by themselves is a complete idiot;235xxx;1;3;1;1;1;1;5;1;3;1
take a look at mehgans full response below;235xxx;5;5;1;0;1;1;1;1;5;1
this is how kate middleton is redecorating kensington palace;236xxx;5;5;1;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
it was announced in january that the duke and duchess of cambridge will be moving to london later this year settling in the capital for the long term from autumn;236xxx;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;5;1;1
with the duke and duchess planning to take on more royal engagements and prince george 3 due to start school at thomas’s london day school in battersea from september a move for the family of four made sense;236xxx;3;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
announcing the news they released an official statement ‘their royal highnesses love their time in norfolk and it will continue to be their home;236xxx;1;5;1;1;1;1;5;1;1;1
from this autumn however the duke and duchess will increasingly base their family at kensington palace;236xxx;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
as they have in recent years their royal highnesses are keen to continue to increase their official work on behalf of the queen and for the charities and causes they support which will require greater time spent in london’;236xxx;1;5;1;1;1;1;5;1;1;1
with the move scheduled to take place in the coming months it comes as no surprise that the duke and duchess are already starting to make kensington palace ready for the family or four plus lupo the cocker spaniel;236xxx;3;5;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
having renovated the palace a few years back in a £1 million revamp kate middleton is said to be enlisting the help of interior designer to the stars ben pentreath to help give the palace a more homely vibe;236xxx;1;5;1;3;1;1;1;3;1;1
the designer who helped decorate her norfolk home amner hall and who boasts a starstudded client list from liv tyler to sarah jessica parker is said to be helping kate to decorate and furnish apartment 1a of kensington palace giving it a traditional and luxurious feel;236xxx;1;5;1;3;1;1;1;5;1;1
according to hello magazine the duchess has gone for a neutral colour palette decorating her drawing room with traditional furnishings from long floorlength curtains plants and tapestry rugs to cream lamps and gold framed artwork;236xxx;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;3;1;1
there’s also said to be a few modern additions including an octagonal coffee table and some fluffy cushions;236xxx;1;5;1;3;1;1;1;1;1;1
we’re getting some serious interiors envy already – if you’ll excuse us we’re off to buy some cream lamps and fluffy cushions;236xxx;5;5;1;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
are kendall kylie jenner and gigi bella hadid headed for a nasty feud;239zzz;5;3;1;0;1;1;1;1;3;1
it looks like a case of siblings war;239zzz;5;1;1;0;1;1;1;1;3;1
two of the most popular siblings duo – kendall kylie and bella gigi – are reported to be on the verge of a nasty feud;239zzz;1;3;1;1;1;1;1;5;1;1
the shocking claim comes days after bella hadid and kendall jenner were spotted attending cannes and vacationing together;239zzz;1;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
but what went wrong;239zzz;5;5;1;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
it appears that the jenner mother kris jenner is to be blamed for the spiteful dispute;239zzz;5;3;1;5;1;1;1;1;3;1
according to a report by star the jenner sisters and hadid sisters are at war and kris jenner is fuelling the surprising conflict;239zzz;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;5;3;1
apparently mommanager has designed a plan to make her daughters kendall and kylie the next it girls of the fashion industry by replacing the hadid siblings;239zzz;3;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;3;1
a source told the gossip website that kris is setting the stage for a nasty fight between the young models the outlet also claims kris is hellbent on getting a contract for either kendall or kylie with tommy hilfiger like gigi currently has;239zzz;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;5;3;1
adding to the speculation the source explained the bottom line is the hadid girls have that it factor but try telling kris she will stop at nothing to make sure her children succeed shes determined to have her daughters in the top spot;239zzz;1;5;1;3;1;1;1;3;1;1
the claims sound dubious considering the fact that all the four stars are successful in their respective ways and have been closest of friends;239zzz;5;5;1;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
this led to gossip cop reaching out to their sources to find out if the claims are true;239zzz;1;5;1;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
as it turns out the stars claims are not true;239zzz;1;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
gossip cop writes kendall and kylie are not at war with gigi and bella nor is the matriarch plotting to have her daughters overtake the hadids in the fashion world whats more the four stars are actually the best of friends and any claims made otherwise are completely unfounded theyre not in competition with each other but extremely supportive of one another there is no feud between the sister pairs but just the opposite;239zzz;1;5;1;1;1;1;5;1;1;1
it comes as no surprise that this claim was false considering the bond kendall kylie bella and gigi share;239zzz;5;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
bella and kendall accompanied by kylie were recently seen at the new york fashion week together where kendall turned photographer for bella and took a beautiful picture of the victorias secret model;239zzz;3;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1

turkeys culture minister compares artifact smugglers to  mafia  ?ñmer erbil   ankara  historic artifact smugglers have established a mafiastyle order  and the ministry is working to return smuggled artifacts to turkey culture and tourism minister numan kurtulmu?ü told daily h?ºrriyet on feb 4;728290310;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;5;1;1
kurtulmu?ü said a team within the general directorate for cultural heritage and museums is closely following all collections and auctions in europe to see if any artifact smuggled out of turkey is being exhibited or sold;728290310;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;5;1;1
if they detect any the culture and tourism ministry works in collaboration with the foreign ministry to get them back through diplomatic channels;728290310;1;5;1;3;1;1;1;1;1;5
historical artifact smugglers operate like mafias;728290310;5;1;1;0;1;3;1;1;1;1
they commercialize precious artifacts in numerous places across the world no matter how hard the conditions are for them  kurtulmu?ü said;728290310;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;5;3;1
for instance we talk about antique cities destroyed by the daesh in syria;728290310;5;3;1;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
i believe we will see many art pieces from those cities in important collections or museums in the west  he added using an arabic acronym for the islamic state of iraq and the levant isil;728290310;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1;5;1
kurtulmu?ü also said they are constantly calling on the international community to look into the issue stressing the uncivilized  act of exhibiting smuggled artifacts;728290310;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;5;1;1
as for renovation works kurtulmu?ü said a single structure was required to oversee all renovation works at every stage of the process;728290310;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;5;1;1
it is important to pay particular attention to conservation rules;728290310;5;5;3;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
instead of granting a renovations permit first and seeing the results later we should constantly inspect the process as a whole  he said;728290310;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;5;1;1

east jerusalem was captured by israel in a 1967 war and palestinians want it for the capital of a future state;728381590;1;5;1;0;1;1;1;1;3;3
israel considers all of jerusalem its eternal and indivisible capital a claim that is not recognized internationally;728381590;3;5;1;0;1;1;1;1;3;3

williams said alfallaj failed his pilots test twice which he said no student of his has ever done before;729103417;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;5;1;1
the flight instructor also remembered a day in june 2017 when the fbi came asking for documents on alfallaj;729103417;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1

¬© video  newshub image  getty australia voted to legalise gay marriage late last year;729280542;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
the caribbean atoll of bermuda has made history by becoming the first nation in the world to revoke its legalisation of samesex marriage;729280542;3;5;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
the british territory which only legalised gay marriage in may 2017 thanks to a supreme court ruling has seen six samesex weddings in the eight months leading to now;729280542;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
the marriages between those couples will still be recognised it has been revealed but from now on gay marriage will be replaced with domestic partnerships;729280542;1;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
the partnership carries equal rights to that of marriage but without the title;729280542;1;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
the change to the legislation came after a referendum in the country of 60000 which found that the majority of bermudians were opposed to samesex marriage;729280542;1;5;1;3;1;1;1;1;5;1
despite bermudas status as an dependent british territory which allows the uk to block any of its proposed law changes uk prime minister theresa may said such an action would not be appropriate;729280542;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;5;1;5
that bill has been democratically passed by the parliament of bermuda and our relationship with the overseas territories is based on partnership and respect for their right to democratic selfgovernment she said;729280542;1;5;1;1;1;1;5;1;1;5
she did add however that she had been left seriously disappointed by their decision;729280542;1;5;1;1;1;1;5;1;1;5
bermudian minister of home affairs walton brown says the move has protected the rights of samesex couples whilst restating that marriage must be between a male and a female;729280542;1;5;1;1;1;1;5;1;1;1

the office has been leaderless despite trump calling the opioid epidemic one of his top priorities;729691344;1;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
he declared it a public health emergency in october a designation that was extended last month;729691344;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;5;1;1
but the white house has offered no concrete solutions on how to solve the crisis and little has happened in the months since that the declaration was made;729691344;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
at least seven of trumps appointees have left the office of national drug control policy in the past year;729691344;3;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;5
some of their duties were assumed by a 24yearold trump campaign worker who became the offices deputy chief of staff;729691344;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;5
carroll was chosen by white house chief of staff john kelly to be his deputy after serving in the white house counsels office and the office of management and budget;729691344;1;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;5
he was previously a lawyer for ford motor company;729691344;1;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1

mike segarreuters  president donald trump seeking to counter the explosive claims made in a recent tellall book by the journalist michael wolff reportedly plans to cooperate with the fiery fox news host jeanine pirro on very different type of book;729894510;1;3;1;1;1;1;1;5;1;1
trump and pirro met at the white house on wednesday to discuss the project and trump agreed over lunch to be interviewed the new york times reported citing sources familiar with the matter;729894510;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;5;5;1
the new book known informally by west wing staff as no fire no fury would seek to rebuke the notion pushed throughout wolffs book that trump is unstable and unfit for the presidency;729894510;5;3;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
among an array of wild and thinly sourced claims wolff wrote that every single person around trump including his top advisors and family members questioned his intelligence;729894510;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;5;1;5
trump has spent much of the last several weeks fuming over wolffs book and its portrayal of him;729894510;5;1;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;5
he has even asked the white house counsel whether he could sue wolff for libel though his advisers have told him he cant the times reported;729894510;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;5;1;1
pirro 66 is one of trumps most vocal champions in the media and was already working on a book set for june 12 publication titled liars leakers and liberals;729894510;5;5;1;3;1;1;1;1;3;5
its unclear whether that book will contain the trump interview and rebuttals to wolffs claims though pirro told the times that the book will not be a direct response to fire and fury;729894510;5;5;1;1;1;1;1;5;1;5

lorenzana signed the canadian helicopter deal last week at the singapore air show last week but canada ordered a review after learning the aircraft would be used in antirebel operations;730209444;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;5
i think there is malice in the way it is being raised lorenzana told reporters;730209444;1;5;1;1;1;1;5;1;1;1
it is not an attack helicopter but a mediumlift meaning for transport of personnel and supplies  we are not asking these for free but were buying them  we do not have to justify how we will use these equipment;730209444;1;5;1;1;1;1;5;1;1;1

marion mar?©challe pen the rising french nationalist offered a vision of france that borrowed largely from the platform of president trump during a speech at the conservative political action conference on thursday;733150531;3;5;1;1;1;1;1;5;5;5
i want america first for the american people britain first for the british people and france first for the french people she said adding when the people are given the opportunity to take their country back they will seize it;733150531;1;5;1;1;1;1;5;1;1;1

the party was founded by her grandfather jeanmarie le pen in 1972;733150531;3;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;3
despite efforts at rebranding the party is seen by many as representing latent strains of antisemitism and xenophobia in french society;733150531;5;1;1;0;1;5;1;1;1;5
she also criticized the notion of a unified european continent;733150531;1;5;1;0;1;1;1;1;1;1

milwaukee  cities plagued by shootings are now battling a new type of gun violence known as paintball wars;752366144;1;1;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
in the last week there have been more than 200 paintball shootings reported in atlanta detroit greensboro north carolina and milwaukee where 65 incidents have been reported in four days;752366144;1;1;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
sgt  melissa franckowiak attributes the uptick to atlantabased rapper who calls himself 21 savage;752366144;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;5;1;1
he reportedly started a movement called guns down paintballs up in an effort to curb gun violence in atlanta;752366144;1;1;1;1;1;1;5;1;1;1
its an idea that may have backfired;752366144;5;3;1;0;1;1;1;1;1;1

in another tragic incident in greensboro police linked a paintball fight to the death of 19yearold zyquarius bradley;752366144;1;3;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
on april 20 his body was discovered next to a car covered with paintballs;752366144;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
frankowiak says even though paintball guns are toys theyre still dangerous;752366144;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;5;1;1
if theyre shooting it directly at people theyre going to be arrested she said;752366144;1;1;1;1;1;1;5;1;1;1
another concern for police is that especially at night a paintball gun could be mistaken for a real gun which could potentially lead to a policeinvolved shooting;752366144;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;5;1;1

no social network or messenger was blocked by this government and wont be blocked  iranian president hassan rouhani stated as cited by the insa news agency;753408180;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;5;1;3

brennan wrote on twitter  today donald trump simultaneously lied about the iranian nuclear deal undermined global confidence in us commitments alienated our closest allies strengthened iranian hawks  gave north korea more reason to keep its nukes;754386963;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;5;1;1
this madness is a danger to our national security;754386963;5;1;1;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
john o brennan johnbrennan may 8 2018  brennan now an analyst for nbc news and msnbc made similar comments on the air;754386963;5;5;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
this is not just foolish this is dangerous  he said;754386963;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;5;1;1
and mr  trump has repeatedly misrepresented the facts of the nuclear deal with iran;754386963;5;1;1;5;1;1;1;1;5;5
hes basically lied to the american people and lied to the world about what that deal entails;754386963;5;1;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
brennan was not alone in criticizing the move;754386963;5;5;1;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
the leaders of the united kingdom france and germany issued a joint statement expressing regret and concern;754386963;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;5;1;1
in iran one lawmaker said trump does not have the mental capacity to deal with issues  and members of parliament burned a paper version of an american flag and a symbolic copy of the iran deal;754386963;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;5;1;5
brennan has been a constant critic of the president since leaving office on trumps 2017 inauguration;754386963;3;1;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;5
in march he slammed trump for hailing the justice departments decision to fire former fbi deputy director andrew mccabe just two days before retirement;754386963;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;5;1;5
you may scapegoat andy mccabe  brennan wrote at the time;754386963;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;5;1;1
but you will not destroy america‚ä¶ america will triumph over you;754386963;5;1;1;0;1;1;1;1;5;1
earlier this year brennan described himself as nonpartisan  and told npr he had respect for both democratic and republican presidents he has served;754386963;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;5;1;5
trump however was different;754386963;3;5;1;0;1;1;1;1;1;3
jennifer aniston im not a sad childless human;006xxx;1;5;1;3;1;1;5;1;1;1
jennifer aniston has no doubt that husband justin theroux is the one for her;006xxx;1;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
why is he the right person for me all i know is that i feel completely seen and adored in no matter what state she told the december issue of marie claire;006xxx;1;5;1;1;5;1;5;1;1;1
theres no part of me that i dont feel comfortable showing exposing and it brings forth the best part of myself because i care about him so much and hes such a good person it hurts me to think of anything hurting him;006xxx;1;5;1;3;1;1;5;1;1;1
that was one of the reasons that aniston spoke out earlier this year in an oped piece in the huffington post;006xxx;1;5;3;5;1;1;1;3;1;1
my marital status has been shamed my divorce status was shamed my lack of a mate had been shamed my nipples have been shamed she told marie claire;006xxx;1;1;1;1;1;1;5;1;1;1
its like why are we only looking at women through this particular lens of picking us apart why are we listening to it i just thought i have worked too hard in this life and this career to be whittled down to a sad childless human;006xxx;1;1;1;3;5;3;5;1;1;1
jennifer aniston the objectification of women in media is absurd and disturbing;006xxx;1;1;3;1;1;5;3;1;3;1
jennifer aniston reveals secret to happy marriage professional success;006xxx;1;3;1;3;1;1;1;1;1;1
in july aniston 47 wrote in the huffington post that she and her husband 44 also an actor are relentlessly harassed by photographers who will go to shocking lengths to take their picture;006xxx;1;5;1;1;1;1;5;1;1;1
but the stories that question whether shes pregnant are what bother her most as she feels they perpetuate the myth that women need to have children to be happy;006xxx;3;3;3;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
heres where i come out on this topic we are complete with or without a mate with or without a child we get to decide for ourselves what is beautiful when it comes to our bodies that decision is ours and ours alone she wrote;006xxx;1;1;1;1;1;1;5;1;1;1
lets make that decision for ourselves and for the young women in this world who look to us as examples lets make that decision consciously outside of the tabloid noise we dont need to be married or mothers to be complete we get to determine our own happily ever after for ourselves;006xxx;1;1;3;1;1;1;5;1;1;1
jennifer aniston finally pregnant at 48 years old  celeb dirty laundry;007xxx;3;1;5;0;5;1;1;1;3;5
jennifer aniston and justin theroux have been married more than a year so the inevitable pregnancy rumors will begin according to the latest cover issue of star magazine jennifer aniston is finally pregnant at 48 years old;007xxx;1;1;3;3;1;1;5;1;1;1
now weve heard in the past that jennifer aniston has struggled to get pregnant even back when she was married to brad pitt;007xxx;3;5;1;5;1;3;1;1;5;1
in fact one of the most persistent rumors is that brad pitt dumped jennifer aniston because she couldnt get pregnant and he wanted children so badly;007xxx;1;1;3;3;1;1;1;1;1;1
the fact that he went on to start a family with angelina jolie immediately after their divorce speaks to that rumor;007xxx;5;3;5;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
so poor single jennifer struggled for a few years until she met fellow famewhoreinchief justin theroux;007xxx;5;1;5;3;1;1;1;1;1;1
the two stayed together against all odds and even decided to get married and now they are reportedly going to start having babies;007xxx;3;5;1;3;1;1;1;1;1;1
sources tell star its taken jen and justin 16 months of ivf treatments and theyve been through so much heartache along the way but now it seems their baby dreams have finally come true;007xxx;1;5;1;3;1;1;5;1;1;1
the source also adds im sure theyve already planned to throw two baby showers in la one for jen and one for justin since this is his first time being a dad;007xxx;1;5;1;3;1;1;5;1;1;1
well first – jennifer aniston pregnancy rumors are nothing new;007xxx;3;3;3;3;1;1;1;1;1;1
weve heard this time and time again and this is probably the 400th time that tabloids have come out with a jennifer aniston is pregnant;007xxx;5;1;3;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
cover however we have to question – could this time actually be true;007xxx;5;1;3;0;5;1;1;1;1;1
you can only throw darts at the board for so long before they start sticking to the board and this might be an instance where the tabloids have guessed about it or so long that its now coming true;007xxx;5;3;3;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
however – even if jennifer aniston is pregnant and thats a big if – it is extremely unlikely that theyre planning on throwing two baby showers that seems excessive even for them;007xxx;5;1;3;3;1;1;1;1;1;1
while a pregnancy would undoubtedly be good news for the couple they would probably want to keep it undercover – at least for a little while – and throwing two big baby showers isnt going to help them keep the news discreet;007xxx;5;1;5;5;1;1;1;1;5;3
or heck maybe they want the attention – theyll be able to use the pregnancy to sell their movies tv shows etc;007xxx;5;1;3;5;1;1;1;1;5;5
come back to cdl for all your jennifer aniston news and updates;007xxx;5;1;5;5;1;3;1;1;5;5
do you think jennifer is pregnant this time;007xxx;5;1;5;0;5;1;1;1;5;5
sorry paris hilton never actually ordered kim k around on the simple life;018xxx;1;3;3;3;1;1;1;1;1;1
the internet loves to remind itself of kim kardashians relatively humble beginnings;018xxx;1;3;1;3;1;1;1;1;1;1
that is before she became the worlds most famous reality star she spent her days toiling as an assistant to thenbff paris hilton;018xxx;1;3;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
whats more the internet loves to relive a few moments of hilton being particularly unkind to kardashian as she allegedly orders her around;018xxx;3;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
those moments were forever captured on camera for episodes of the simple life back in the mid2000s;018xxx;3;3;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
screengrabs from these episodes have become very popular but theres just one problem  the captions are completely fake and your favorite kim kardashian meme is a fraud;018xxx;3;3;3;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
heres the conversation that actually took place on the episode;018xxx;3;3;3;3;1;1;1;1;1;1
yep that was a scene about giving a dog a pregnancy test;018xxx;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;3;1;1
but moving on this gif with a caption of hilton telling kardashian to organize her closet is again also 100 percent fake;018xxx;3;3;1;1;1;1;1;3;1;1
and while it may be fake it may actually be better than the real conversation that was had in paris closet that day;018xxx;1;3;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
paris i love this closet its so good;018xxx;1;3;1;1;1;1;3;1;1;1
kim whats going on with this;018xxx;1;3;1;1;5;1;3;1;1;1
paris thats my if i ever go to india outfit;018xxx;1;3;1;1;1;1;3;1;1;1
kim really;018xxx;1;3;1;1;5;1;3;1;1;1
paris yes;018xxx;1;3;1;1;1;1;3;1;1;1
kim are you planning on going;018xxx;1;3;1;1;5;1;3;1;1;1
paris yes but dont you have to like cover up everything;018xxx;1;3;1;1;5;1;3;1;1;1
kim youre not allowed to show any of your hair;018xxx;1;3;1;1;1;1;3;1;1;1
its like a law;018xxx;1;3;1;1;1;1;3;1;1;1
paris are you allowed to have blond hair if you travel there do you really have to do this;018xxx;1;3;1;1;5;1;3;1;1;1
kim i think so or youll get like shot or something;018xxx;1;3;1;1;1;1;3;1;1;1
paris thats hot;018xxx;1;5;1;1;1;1;3;1;1;1
its difficult to pinpoint exactly where these screengrabs with fake captions originated but multiple news outlets just assumed they were real and the myth of hilton as a demanding boss who desperately needed her closet organized only continued to grow;018xxx;3;5;3;3;1;1;1;1;1;1
however after learning what hilton and kardashian were really discussing at the time the two might now be wishing the hotel heiress was actually ordering the future reality star to clean her closet;018xxx;3;5;3;3;1;1;1;1;1;1
so if you want these memes to live on use the right captions;018xxx;3;5;3;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
are taylor swift and jake gyllenhaal dating again;021zzz;3;1;5;0;5;1;1;1;3;1
there are reports that taylor swiftis trying to rekindle her relationship with exboyfriend jake gyllenhaal;021zzz;3;3;3;3;1;1;1;1;1;1
ok magazine is reporting that the wildest dreams singer has been contacting her ex ever since he has been in new york city starring in the broadway show called sunday in the park with george;021zzz;1;5;1;1;1;1;5;3;1;1
the tabloid is reporting that a source is saying that taylor is the one reaching out to the actor since she feels she is now more mature than she was when they dated back in 2010;021zzz;3;5;3;0;1;1;1;5;1;1
the source said taylor was so young when they dated she wasnt ready for a serious relationship but now shes showing jake how much shes matured shes excited to see where things go;021zzz;1;3;3;3;1;1;5;1;1;1
in 2015 a rumor swirled around saying that the stars were in contact with each other even though she was dating calvin harris at the time;021zzz;3;3;3;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
an unidentified source told star magazine that he said he owed taylor an apology for how things ended between them in june jake ran into cara delevingne at the graham norton show and asked for taylors new number theyve kept in touch albeit secretly ever since;021zzz;1;5;1;3;1;1;5;1;1;1
this would all be so ironic since taylor allegedly wrote the hit song we are never getting back together from her red album about the relationship after her exs friend asked her if they were giving their relationship a second chance;021zzz;5;3;5;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
this guy walks in who is a friend of my exs and starts talking about how hes heard were going to get back together and that was not the case so i start telling them the story break up get back together breakup get back together  just ugh the worst and i picked up the guitar and songwriting partner max martin said this is what were writing she once revealed to gma;021zzz;1;3;1;0;1;1;5;1;1;1
the lyrics in the track said im really gonna miss you picking fights  and me falling for it screaming that im right  and you would hide away and find your peace of mind  with some indie record thats much cooler than mine;021zzz;1;1;3;0;1;1;5;1;1;1
in the video for the song the actor who plays the singers love interest gives her a scarf which many thought to be a clue that revealed the song was about jake since she had been photographed wearing one of his scarfs while they were dating;021zzz;5;3;5;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
since taylor is now single and so is jake and they both happen to be living in the same city we dont see how this could be a problem there is no confirmation that this is actually happening though and a source close to them told gossip cop that there was no truth to the report;021zzz;5;3;5;3;1;1;5;1;1;1
do you think taylor should get back together with jake;021zzz;5;3;5;0;5;1;1;1;1;1
tell us in the comments;021zzz;1;3;3;0;1;1;1;1;1;1

in most cases close friends of the kardashian family are locked into confidentiality agreements which prohibit them from speaking publicly about the family;040zzz;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
but apparently tyga never signed any form of agreement which would allow him to speak publicly if he desires;040zzz;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
a family insider recently shared details about the alleged book;040zzz;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
although tyga and kylie jenner initially tried desperately to conceal their relationship because of kylies age its no secret hes been in her life for quite some time;040zzz;3;3;1;3;1;1;1;1;1;1

the insider also claims tyga has a staggering amount of incriminating details about kim kardashian and kanye west for his tellall book;040zzz;1;1;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
since tyga and kanye have collaborated on records hes spent lots of time with the yeezus rapper and his famous wife;040zzz;1;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
but apparently all of his interactions with the couple havent been pleasant;040zzz;3;3;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
in fact the insider claims tyga has enough dirt on the couple to write more than one book;040zzz;1;1;3;3;1;1;1;1;1;1
for months now several rumors have circulated about the famous couples marital problems but of course the rumors have not been confirmed;040zzz;1;5;1;3;1;1;1;1;1;1
reports about tygas tellall book come shortly after their epic breakup on the rappers 26th birthday;040zzz;1;1;1;0;1;1;1;3;1;1
according to people magazine kylie jenner is absolutely furious about her exboyfriends alleged cheating;040zzz;1;1;3;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
an insider close to the 18yearold reality star recently shared details about her reaction to the heartwrenching breakup;040zzz;1;1;5;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
although the kardashian women have a history of onagain offagain relationships it looks like this may definitely be the end for tyga and kylie jenner;040zzz;1;1;3;5;1;1;1;1;1;1

aww;116zzz;3;1;3;0;3;1;1;1;1;1
how sweet;116zzz;5;1;5;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
jelena may not cover bey and jay’s iconic 2003 hit “crazy in love” anytime soon but selena’s living the song 247 she’s even changing the minds of doubters and haters all with the power of her love;116zzz;5;1;5;3;1;1;3;1;1;1
“as much as people around her are worried that she’ll end up heartbroken all over again it’s hard not to be happy for her” the source tells hollywoodlifecom;116zzz;5;1;5;1;1;1;3;1;1;1
“she tried her best to put things with him behind her and for a long time it seemed like she had but it’s obvious now that she was carrying a heavy weight around with her this whole time now that she’s back with justin that weight has lifted she just seems very light and joyful”;116zzz;3;5;3;5;1;1;3;1;1;1
it seems that justin feels the same way as he’s reportedly working on being a “better person” for selena;116zzz;5;5;3;3;1;1;3;1;1;1
justin who notoriously left selena’s heart broken in two in the past is reportedly changing his ways to make her happy which in turn makes them both happy;116zzz;5;5;3;3;1;1;0;1;1;1
he’s even supposedly considering settling down with selena in the future;116zzz;5;5;3;3;1;1;0;1;1;1
of course before he could even consider getting down on one knee selena needs to convince her family and friends that he’s legit;116zzz;5;3;3;3;1;1;0;1;1;1
considering the biebs was absent from the selena gomez family thanksgiving he may have a ways to go on that;116zzz;5;5;3;3;1;1;0;1;1;1

high treason kidding;116zzz;5;1;3;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
yeah calling for these two split seems a bit harsh for a social media slipup right;116zzz;5;1;3;0;3;1;1;1;1;1
considering how much selena is “in love” with justin perhaps her fans could relax a bit;116zzz;3;3;3;0;5;1;3;1;1;1

jim carrey attends fashion week party just to roast fashion week parties 20170911;172xxx;5;1;5;5;1;1;1;1;3;1
jim carrey once an actor now an artiste and cultural commenter stopped by new york fashion week to neg it;172xxx;3;1;5;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
e news’s catt sadler caught up with carrey on the red carpet of the harper’s bazaar icons party friday night and the twominute clip of their exchange has been percolating on twitter ever since;172xxx;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
after she pointed out that she’d never seen him at the biannual spectacle he explained to her the following “there’s no meaning to any of this;172xxx;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
so i wanted to find the most meaningless thing that i could come to and join and here i am” watch sadler’s eyes as she fully comprehends what she’s about to endure;172xxx;5;1;5;5;1;1;5;1;1;1
“celebrating icons” carrey says;172xxx;1;5;1;3;1;1;5;1;1;1
“boy that is just the absolute lowest aiming possibility we could come up with do you believe in icons”;172xxx;5;1;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;3
when sadler started to answer he interjected “i don’t believe in personalities;172xxx;1;5;1;5;5;1;1;1;1;1
i don’t believe that you exist but there is a wonderful fragrance in the air”;172xxx;1;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;5
carrey then looked in the camera and gave his speech “i don’t believe in icons;172xxx;1;1;3;3;1;3;5;1;1;1
i don’t believe in personalities;172xxx;1;1;3;3;1;3;5;1;3;1
i believe that peace lies beyond personalities beyond invention and disguise beyond the red ‘s’ that you wear on your chest that makes bullets bounce off;172xxx;1;1;3;3;1;3;5;1;3;1
i believe that it’s deeper than that;172xxx;1;1;3;3;1;1;5;1;1;1
i believe we’re a field of energy dancing for itself and—uh—i don’t care”;172xxx;1;1;3;3;1;1;5;1;1;1
it wasn’t exactly extemporaneous poetry the lines are borrowed from a commencement speech he gave in 2014 at iowa’s maharishi university of management;172xxx;1;1;1;3;1;1;1;1;1;1
yes he sounded like a liberalarts student on a particularly mellow week night;172xxx;5;1;5;1;1;5;1;1;1;1
and it’s not clear whether he sensed the irony in himself saying all of that while attending the party and wearing a flashy tailored suit asked about his getup he said “i didn’t get dressed up;172xxx;5;1;3;3;1;1;5;1;1;1
there is no me;172xxx;5;1;3;1;1;3;5;1;1;1
there’s just things happening”;172xxx;5;1;5;1;1;3;5;1;1;1
carrey’s referendum despite its slightly unbearable pitch rings somewhat true amid the backdrop of destruction caused by hurricanes harvey and irma;172xxx;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
and charlottesville;172xxx;5;1;5;0;1;1;1;1;1;3
and the general mood of melancholy that has settled over the country like a thick fog;172xxx;5;1;1;1;1;5;1;1;1;1
it’s hard to see where the art and commercialism and spectacle of nyfw fits into all that;172xxx;1;1;3;0;1;1;5;1;1;5
designers themselves have struggled with that question since the 2016 election as have many creators in other fields;172xxx;5;3;5;5;1;1;1;1;1;5
the world looks different now than it did even last february and it will somersault a thousand more times before the clothing parade gears again up next february;172xxx;3;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
but make no mistake the parade will go on;172xxx;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
but that’s not even it really carrey said;172xxx;1;5;3;3;1;1;1;5;1;1
“it’s not our world we don’t matter that’s the good news”;172xxx;1;1;5;3;1;1;5;1;1;1

it appears selena gomez just adopted a new puppy with the weeknd;173xxx;3;5;3;5;1;1;1;1;5;5
less than a week ago selena gomez and the weeknd aka abel tesfaye were spotted playing with a pack of puppies at a nyc pet store—and now it seems selenas brought one of them home;173xxx;1;3;1;3;1;1;1;1;1;1
after all the heart wants what it wants  wink wink;173xxx;3;1;3;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
in photos obtained by elle  selenas assistant theresa mingus was spotted on thursday picking up the exact same cavalier king charles spaniel puppy that selena saw last weekend;173xxx;1;5;1;3;1;1;1;1;1;1
later theresa was seen delivering the pup to the fetish singers apartment;173xxx;1;5;1;3;1;1;5;1;1;1
a fan account on twitter also posted pictures from the store before theresa picked up the puppy in which a sign reading im going home soon posted to the dogs kennel;173xxx;3;3;3;3;1;1;1;1;1;1
while many of selenas fans expressed their excitement on social media for the newest addition to her family others were disappointed because theyre assuming she chose to purchase the dog from a pet store many of which are notorious for selling puppies raised in unethical puppy mills  rather than adopting one from a shelter;173xxx;3;5;5;3;1;1;1;1;1;1
why buy instead of adopting this makes me so mad one twitter user wrote;173xxx;1;1;3;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
in an instagram comment screenshot by another insta user one person wrote  i also cant believe you would buy a puppy from the pet stores that are breeding and putting animals in glass and have them in bad living situations dont support stuff like that girl  thought you knew better;173xxx;1;1;3;3;1;1;5;1;1;1
it has not been confirmed where the pet store selenas puppy is from gets its animals and selenas team has not confirmed or denied any information about the animal at this time;173xxx;3;5;1;3;1;1;1;1;1;1
fans are also wondering whether the dog belongs solely to selena—who had rescued five shelter dogs as of 2010 according to people —or if abelena are coparenting the pooch;173xxx;1;5;1;3;1;1;1;1;1;1
if its the latter they wont be alone joe jonas and sophie turner who have been dating since december adopted a husky puppy together just last weekend and have already set up an instagram account for porky basquiat;173xxx;3;5;3;3;1;1;1;1;1;1

the first pic showed them in their red carpet finest while the second photo featured her in a pink bikini with her legs wrapped around meaden 30 as they kissed near a waterfall;175xxx;1;3;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
the aftermath star posted his own tribute to the modern family actress 19 writing “i can’t believe it’s been a year;175xxx;1;1;1;1;1;1;5;1;1;3
we’ve had adventures;175xxx;1;3;3;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
gotten dolled up countless times;175xxx;1;1;3;1;1;1;1;1;3;1
and traveled through 3 continents together;175xxx;1;3;3;1;1;1;1;1;1;1

i love you more than anything happy anniversary peanut butter”;175xxx;1;1;3;1;1;1;5;1;1;5
earlier this week winter dished to us weekly about meaden saying that they “have a great relationship”;175xxx;3;1;1;3;1;1;5;1;1;1
“he’s just the loveliest person he loves me through thick and thin” she told us;175xxx;1;3;3;3;1;1;5;1;1;1
“he’s always telling me no matter what i’m wearing no matter what i’m doing that i’m beautiful”;175xxx;1;3;3;3;1;1;5;1;1;1
the couple live together in la in a house that winter bought last year;175xxx;3;5;3;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
“my boyfriend and i live together and he cooks” she told jimmy kimmel this past may;175xxx;3;5;3;3;1;1;5;1;1;1
“i can’t cook at all he takes care of all that handy stuff he’s great he does all that i can bake a pie occasionally pumpkin and apple i baked those two the other day they were edible”;175xxx;1;1;3;3;1;1;5;1;1;1
who is mark billingham the bodyguard claims he fathered brangelinas kids;183xxx;5;1;3;5;1;1;5;1;3;1
since the news of brad pitt and angelina jolies split many have wondered what will happen to the couples six kids;183xxx;3;1;3;3;1;1;1;1;1;3
will they stay with mom or with dad or some combination of the two;183xxx;3;1;1;0;1;1;1;1;1;3
or could a third person have parenting rights as well;183xxx;3;1;1;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
enter mark billingham the star couples bodyguard;183xxx;5;1;3;0;1;1;1;1;3;1
billingham said he basically fathered the children according to us weekly;183xxx;5;1;3;3;1;1;5;1;5;1
of course billingham is not asking for custody — and even if he did he probably wouldnt be awarded it considering hes not related by blood to the kids and he was only with the family for 18 months;183xxx;5;3;3;5;1;1;1;1;5;1
but its interesting that the guard would choose to come forward with the details of his employments now especially amidst some rumors of pitts shortcomings as a father;183xxx;5;5;3;5;1;1;1;1;3;1
according to billingham the couples primary concern was their children;183xxx;5;5;1;1;1;1;1;1;5;1
they wanted the guard to keep the six kids — maddox 15 pax 12 zahara 11 shiloh 10 and 8yearold twins knox and vivienne — safe particularly from kidnapping;183xxx;5;3;1;3;1;1;1;1;3;1
a former member of the british army billingham described the couples intense protectiveness of their children;183xxx;5;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;5;1
pitt and jolie didnt want the kids spending time or going anywhere with strangers;183xxx;5;3;1;5;1;3;1;1;5;1
they were also worried about stalkers who could endanger the lives of their children according to the sun;183xxx;5;3;3;0;1;3;1;1;1;1
but billingham said he was was one member of their staff that the couple allowed to get close to the kids according to the sun;183xxx;3;5;1;3;1;1;1;5;1;1
billingham said he became so close with the kids that he was an unofficial father;183xxx;5;1;5;1;1;1;5;5;3;3
but he didnt throw any shade at pitt whose parenting style some questioned after jolie filed for divorce;183xxx;1;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
e news reported that pitt was under investigation by the los angeles police department and the department of children and family services as a result of allegations that the actor verbally and physically abused the children;183xxx;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
the allegations have not been substantiated;183xxx;3;5;1;3;1;1;1;1;1;1
from what billingham describes of his relationship to the couple and their children its clear that pitt and jolie want whats best for their children;183xxx;3;3;1;5;1;1;1;1;3;1
in her divorce filing jolie did cite the wellbeing of the kids as a reason for the split;183xxx;1;3;3;5;1;1;1;1;3;3
pitt in his response also emphasized his commitment to the couples children;183xxx;1;5;3;5;1;1;1;3;1;1
hopefully with the right support system — perhaps including people like billingham — the kids will get through the divorce alright;183xxx;1;3;5;5;1;1;1;1;1;3
tom hiddleston still embarrassed about taylor swift ignores fans and media at comiccon  celeb dirty laundry;188zzz;1;5;5;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
for the past several years actor tom hiddleston has been a fan favorite at the san diego comiccon;188zzz;3;3;3;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
but this year fans of the actor were left disappointed when he chose to ignore them and the media while he and the cast of the upcoming superhero film “thor ragnarok” were at comiccon to promote their film which will hit theaters later this year;188zzz;5;3;5;5;1;3;5;1;1;1
tom hiddleston’s portrayal of villan loki in the comic book superhero movie “thor” has garnered him legions of fans mostly female who love his bad boy portrayal of the character;188zzz;5;1;5;5;1;3;5;1;1;1
although tom hiddleston did participate in a panel with the other actors to answer questions about their upcoming film he chose to skip the the opportunity to take photos with fans or sign autographs;188zzz;1;5;1;5;1;1;1;3;3;1
this has left his fans feeling disappointed because some fans actually traveled thousands of miles for the chance to see tom and get a picture with him;188zzz;5;1;3;5;1;3;1;1;1;1
this is a huge departure from years past when tom hiddleston made it a point to see as many fans as possible;188zzz;3;3;3;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
in 2013 while promoting “thor the dark world” tom surprised and delighted fans by coming to the convention dressed in his full loki costume;188zzz;1;5;1;0;1;1;5;1;1;1
but this year he all but ignored his fans and only briefly appeared on the panel with the other actors and director of the movie and left the convention as soon as the panel was over;188zzz;1;3;1;5;1;3;1;1;1;1
audience members also remarked that the usually charming actor didn’t appear too excited to be at comiccon with some of tom’s own fans commenting that the actor appeared to look sad or unhappy;188zzz;3;3;5;5;1;3;1;1;1;1
and it wasn’t just his fans that tom ignored he also chose to not speak to the media while at the convention;188zzz;1;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
besides a few questions from fans and the media during the panel discussion tom refused to be interviewed by journalists;188zzz;1;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
many believe tom is still embarrassed by his whirlwind romance with pop star taylor swift;188zzz;3;1;3;5;1;3;1;1;1;1
tom and taylor swift dated last summer and were heavily criticized for their public displays of affection including tom’s decision to wear a tank top declaring his love for the pop star;188zzz;5;3;5;5;1;3;1;1;1;1
of course tom and taylor swift’s romance only lasted a few months but it has been reported that his brief romance with the singer has hurt his hollywood career and may have even cost him the opportunity to take over the role of james bond;188zzz;3;3;5;5;1;3;1;1;1;1
for the past few months tom has kept a low profile with fans and the media no doubt in hopes of avoiding questions about his past relationship with taylor swift;188zzz;5;3;5;5;1;3;1;1;1;1

gwen stefani shockingly ruptures eardrum  is forced to cancel show — is she okay;207xxx;1;5;1;1;5;1;1;5;1;1
poor gwen stefani the singer shockingly ruptured her eardrum and was forced to cancel an april 27 concert in las vegas because of her medical emergency;207xxx;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;5;1;1
this is so scary;207xxx;1;5;1;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
is gwen’s hearing going to be okay;207xxx;1;5;1;0;5;1;1;1;1;1
gwen stefani 47 went through a terrifying ordeal on april 25 when her eardrum ruptured while on a flight;207xxx;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
the painful injury landed gwen in cedarssinai hospital in los angeles where doctors told her not to fly anywhere or sing until it gets healed;207xxx;3;3;3;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
the brutal injury came at exactly the wrong time for gwen;207xxx;5;1;5;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
she was supposed to sing at the power f love gala in las vegas just two days later;207xxx;1;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
the pop starthe voice judge had to bow out of the prestigious event at the mgm grand where she was set to perform a 30minute live set because of her limitations;207xxx;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
that’s so awful;207xxx;5;1;1;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
guests at the event according to the las vegas reviewjournal were told about the cancellation right before the event;207xxx;5;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1

luckily gwen’s doing okay;207xxx;3;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
she was still on the voice this week and looked happy a ruptured eardrum is no small deal though;207xxx;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
it occurs when a small perforation pops in the eardrum sometimes from trauma ear infection loud noises surgery or flying in a plane with a severe cold;207xxx;1;3;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
you know how your ears pop in a plane it’s like that but way worse;207xxx;1;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
it can lead to temporary hearing loss or ringing in the ears;207xxx;5;1;3;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
it’s unclear how severe gwen’s eardrum is injured but the healing process can take anywhere from a few weeks to a few months and in some very rare cases years;207xxx;1;3;1;3;1;1;1;1;1;1
hollywoodlifers we hope gwen feels better send her your positive getwell vibes in the comments;207xxx;1;5;1;0;1;1;1;1;3;1

she’s babysitting her grandchildren while kourtney and scott are partying thousands of miles away in cannes;212zzz;3;3;5;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
a lot of fans can’t help but wonder why kourtney would still be in cannes knowing that scott is there with his new girlfriend bella thorne;212zzz;1;5;5;3;1;1;1;1;1;1
apparently both parents are trying to compete with each other for paparazzi and media attention while their children are back at home;212zzz;5;5;5;5;1;1;1;1;1;1

but is her new romance with younes bendjima getting in the way of her parental responsibilities;212zzz;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
that might be the case especially since a lot of people are pointing out that both kourtney and scott are acting like children themselves;212zzz;5;3;5;3;1;1;1;1;1;1
kourtney has spent the last week showing off her bikini body and making out with younes in the south of france;212zzz;5;5;5;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
taking a page out of her book scott is now doing the same by partying with bella;212zzz;1;5;5;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
he was even spotted getting very up close and personal with her at their hotel pool in cannes;212zzz;5;5;5;3;1;1;1;1;1;1
clearly scott is trying to make a point by cuddling and making out with the former disney star in the same town as his ex and baby mama;212zzz;5;5;3;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
so far kourtney has not made any comments about her new relationship with younes bendjima;212zzz;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
but if there’s one thing for certain it’s that she doesn’t plan on getting back with scott disick anytime soon;212zzz;5;3;5;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
that chapter is closed done and in the past;212zzz;5;1;3;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
still many critics can’t help but wonder if kourtney might be flaunting her relationship with younes to make scott jealous;212zzz;1;1;3;3;1;1;1;1;1;1
after all scott did it to her several times in the past;212zzz;5;3;5;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
either way it doesn’t look like kourtney kardashian and scott disick’s drama is going to end anytime soon;212zzz;5;3;5;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
in the meantime don’t forget to check back with cdl for all the latest news on kourtney kardashian and scott disick;212zzz;3;1;3;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
iggy azalea and odell beckham jr dating;213zzz;1;1;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
you might be surprised by the news that odell beckham jr and iggy azalea are dating but if you stop and think about it for a moment they actually make perfect sense as a couple;213zzz;5;3;5;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
for one thing odell is famous for his onehanded catch and iggy is a famous onehit wonder;213zzz;3;5;5;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
beckham is forever frustrating defensive backs with his incredible talent while azalea frustrates her peers by being an offensive hack with an appalling lack of talent;213zzz;5;3;5;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
the list goes on and on;213zzz;5;5;3;0;1;1;1;5;1;1
odell is a wide receiver and iggy receives widespread criticism for being awful;213zzz;5;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
beckham runs hot routes and catches passes while azalea received a pass for being a terrible rapper because shes hot;213zzz;5;5;3;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
you get the idea;213zzz;3;5;1;0;1;1;1;3;1;1
anyway according to us weekly beckham and azalea have finally started admitting that theyre a couple;213zzz;3;5;3;1;1;1;1;5;1;1
rumors that odell and iggy are dating first started circulating back in may but both parties denied theyd been hooking up;213zzz;1;3;5;0;1;3;1;1;1;1
“i literally don’t even know odell beckham i don’t” azalea told tmz at the time;213zzz;1;5;3;0;1;1;5;1;1;1
“he was at my friend’s party and we took a picture with a bunch of people and that’s it  i don’t know him i’ve not even had a conversation with him”;213zzz;1;5;3;0;1;1;5;1;1;1
shortly thereafter however iggy admitted that she and beckham were more than friends but insisted they had a long way to go” to become a couple;213zzz;3;5;3;3;1;1;5;1;1;1
now theyre finally dating openly but reps for azalea are still lying about the relationship for some reason;213zzz;5;5;5;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
“it’s new very fresh” one insider tells us;213zzz;1;3;3;3;1;1;5;1;1;1
apparently were all supposed to ignore the fact that iggy and odell have clearly been dating for like six months;213zzz;5;5;5;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
we can actually see why iggy would want to keep her love life out of the headlines;213zzz;5;3;5;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
her last relationship imploded in spectacular fashion when la laker nick young was caught cheating on iggy after his teammate uploaded a candid video of young confessing to infidelity;213zzz;1;1;5;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
shortly thereafter iggy learned that young whom she was engaged to at the time had gotten another woman pregnant;213zzz;1;5;3;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
an experience like that would make anyone want to keep their next relationship on the dl for as long as possible;213zzz;5;5;5;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
for his part odell was previously dating model polyxeni ferfeli;213zzz;5;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
everyone has a type and apparently odells is super into chicks with ridiculous names;213zzz;5;1;5;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
we wonder is polyxeni is also a horrendous rapper;213zzz;3;3;3;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
kathy griffin wants to get roasted on comedy central thinks it may save her career;234zzz;5;1;5;5;1;1;1;1;3;1
kathy griffin got into some hot water after she appeared to be holding donald trump’s severed head in a controversial photo shoot — but she has a plan to win back her audience;234zzz;5;3;3;5;1;1;1;1;1;3
an insider told hollywoodlifecom exclusively that the comedian wants to be roasted on comedy central so she can put herself in a better spotlight;234zzz;3;3;5;3;1;1;1;5;1;1
will it work;234zzz;5;5;5;0;5;1;1;1;1;1
kathy griffin 56 has a reputation of pushing the limits when it comes to comedy but a lot of people felt like her recent stunt went too far;234zzz;1;5;3;3;1;1;1;1;1;1
after posing for photographer tyler shields 35 where she held a bloody donald trump head the public expressed some massive outrage and hardcore backlash — she even got fired from cnn’s annual nye special;234zzz;3;5;3;3;1;1;1;1;1;1
so is her reputation officially destroyed;234zzz;5;1;5;0;5;1;1;1;1;1
maybe not;234zzz;5;3;5;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
kathy wants to be the next celebrity roasted on comedy central;234zzz;5;5;5;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
“kathy knows that she has to combat the recent turmoil she is in with comedy and she wants to face things head on and she wants to be the next person to get roasted” a source tells hollywoodlifecom exclusively;234zzz;1;5;3;3;1;1;5;1;1;1
kathy thinks this could help save her reputation since she is always lightened up when people tease her;234zzz;3;3;5;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
“she wants to show she can take a joke and thinks it will humanize her and make her look better to those she has angered” our source adds;234zzz;1;5;3;3;1;1;5;1;1;1
“she would love to be the next person that comedy central considers”;234zzz;1;5;3;3;1;1;5;1;1;1
comedy central has roasted a good amount of celebrities including justin bieber 23 rob lowe 53 and james franco 39;234zzz;3;1;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
odds are likely that if kathy does become the next person to get roasted then the trump pic will be one of the biggest moments that comes up;234zzz;5;3;3;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
and perhaps some other celebs will mock her in a way that makes her look better than she does now;234zzz;5;1;5;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
but it might be hard to find someone willing to participate in the roast since a lot of celebrities have expressed their disappointment in her including debra messing 48 jeffrey wright 51 don cheadle 52 and of course the president himself;234zzz;3;5;3;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
kathy took to her instagram page on may 30 to post an apology video for the photo;234zzz;1;5;1;3;1;1;1;1;1;1
“i sincerely apologize i’m just now seeing the reaction of these images i’m a comic i crossed the line and i went way too far” she said;234zzz;1;5;3;1;1;1;5;1;1;1
“the image is too disturbing i understand how it offends people it wasn’t funny i get it i’ve made a lot of mistakes in my career i will continue i’ve asked your forgiveness taking down the image gonna ask the photographer to take down the image and i beg for your forgiveness i went too far i made a mistake and i was wrong”;234zzz;1;3;3;1;1;1;5;1;1;1
hollywoodlifers do you think roasting kathy on comedy central could save her career;234zzz;5;3;5;0;5;1;1;1;1;1
kathy griffin 53 has a reputation of pushing the limits when it comes to comedy but a lot of people felt like her recent stunt went too far;234zzz;3;3;5;5;1;1;1;1;1;1

a member of the berkeley city council has been accused of applying a political litmus test regarding support for israel to a sitting commissioner who was dismissed when he did not provide a sufficient answer;716644136;1;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
according to a dec;716644136;1;5;1;1;1;1;5;1;1;1
14 article in berkeleyside cheryl davila who was elected to the berkeley city council last year dismissed transportation commissioner ben gerhardstein last month after he declined to state a position on whether berkeley should divest from companies that do business with israel;716644136;1;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
gerhardstein who was appointed by a former city council member provided berkeleyside with an email chain backing up his assertion;716644136;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
you indicated that a nontransportation issue was important to you in selecting a transportation commissioner  gerhardstein wrote to davila on nov;716644136;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;3;1;1
27 after he had been removed from the commission;716644136;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
during our first meeting you noted that as a human welfare and community action commissioner you authored a recommendation to council to divest from companies benefiting from the israeli occupation of palestinian territories which raised your profile;716644136;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;3;1;1
you said that the issue was important to you and you asked whether i was propalestinian and supported divestment or a zionist;716644136;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;5;1;1
you noted that you were asking all potential district 2 commissioners this question and suggested that you were only interested in appointing divestment supporters to commissions;716644136;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;5;1;1
in a written response to the berkeleyside story davila did not dispute the charge but framed it as an attack on palestinian rights;716644136;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
i cant endorse this either;718219151;5;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
somehow if hillary clinton took up knitting three people would end up dead;718219151;5;1;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;3
but is a female journalist telling hillary clinton to take up knitting sexist;718219151;1;5;1;5;5;1;1;1;1;1
this is the great debate consuming the fever swamps of the maddened left;718219151;1;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;5
vanity fair staffers are ringing in the new year with champagne and cheap shots at hillary clinton;718219151;5;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
take up a new hobby in the new year  suggested vanity fair writer maya kosoff;718219151;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;5;1;1
volunteer work knitting improv comedy ‚äï literally anything that will keep you from running again;718219151;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
wait there was knitting in there;718219151;1;1;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
along with volunteer work and improv comedy;718219151;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
many people were offended by hives condescending tone especially considering clintons extensive political r?©sum?©;718219151;5;1;5;3;1;1;1;1;1;1
others argued that the video was flatout sexist;718219151;5;5;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
its sexist in the same sense that voting against hillary clinton was sexist;718219151;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1;5
in the same sense that voting against obama was racist;718219151;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
in the same sense that anything can be transformed into racism or sexism if it suits the momentary political agenda of the left;718219151;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
and so youve got leftists accusing a lefty woman of sexism;718219151;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
peter daou a former clinton adviser slammed the magazine for insulting one of the most accomplished women in the history of the united states;718219151;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1;3
one of the most accomplished;718219151;5;1;1;5;5;1;1;1;1;1
what were hillarys accomplishments beyond using her husbands position to get into the senate and then losing every single national election;718219151;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1;5
i cant think of a more sexist idea than displacing actual women who accomplished things on their own with hillary clinton;718219151;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1;5
obamas smart diplomacy method for generating talks was to bribe the bad guys with almost everything they wanted;721315996;5;5;5;5;1;5;5;1;5;5
trumps method is applying pressure whether on iran the palestinian authority or north korea;721315996;5;3;5;5;1;5;1;1;1;1
and it clearly gets results as the political turmoil in iran and the sudden outreach by north korea show;721315996;5;5;5;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
now the president of south korea is crediting trump for getting the ball rolling;721315996;5;5;5;5;1;1;1;1;5;5
president trump deserves big credit  for kicking off the first talks between pyongyang and seoul in more than two years south korean president moon jaein said wednesday;721315996;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;5;5;5
north korea agreed tuesday to send a delegation to next months winter olympics which are set to begin next month in pyeongchang south korea;721315996;1;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;5;5
the rival nations talks are the first sign of a possible thaw in their relationship;721315996;1;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;5;5
the talks were held for the first time since 2015 and moon credited trump for sparking them according to reuters;721315996;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1;5;5
i think president trump deserves big credit for bringing about the interkorean talks  moon said at a news conference;721315996;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;5;5;5
it could be a resulting work of the us;721315996;5;3;5;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
;721315996;1;1;1;0;5;1;1;1;1;1
obliviously;721315996;1;1;1;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
the talks will turn out to be futile;721315996;3;3;3;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
north korea has a long history of meaningless negotiations and agreements;721315996;5;1;5;5;1;5;1;1;5;3
trumps pressure drove rocket man to reach out to a weaker leader in south korea;721315996;5;1;5;5;1;5;1;1;5;5
that shows the pressure is working but not that anything is about to change;721315996;5;1;5;3;1;1;1;1;5;5
but it does show that when it comes to generating talks trump is better at it than obama;721315996;5;1;5;5;1;1;1;1;5;5
pressure succeeds where appeasement fails;721315996;5;1;5;5;1;1;1;1;5;5

that included a former president;722571360;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1

who needs a hard calexit when california can enjoy all the benefits of being part of the united states while rejecting the authority of the federal government where it conflicts with the politics of the sacramento dem junta;723825723;5;3;1;0;1;1;1;1;1;3
and so california business owners are greeted with the bizarre spectacle of being threatened by the attorney general of their state if they cooperate with the attorney general of the united states;723825723;3;5;1;3;1;1;1;1;1;1
we havent seen anything like this since the civil rights movement;723825723;5;1;5;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
california attorney general xavier becerra warned employers thursday of legal repercussions if they assist federal immigration officials in an impending crackdown in the sanctuary state the sacramento bee reported;723825723;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
under a new state law   the immigration worker protection act   employers and businesses could face fines of up to 10000 if they provide employee information to us  immigration customs becerra said;723825723;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;5;1;1
if employers start giving up information about their employees or access to their employees in ways that contradict our new california laws they subject themselves to actions by my office;723825723;3;5;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
we will prosecute those who violate the law  he said at a news conference;723825723;3;5;1;1;1;1;1;5;1;1
under obama states were told that they werent allowed to enforce immigration laws;723825723;1;3;1;3;1;1;1;1;1;1
now states are actively threatening businesses that comply with federal enforcement of immigration laws;723825723;1;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
according to leftist judges states dont have the right to enforce immigration laws but do have the right to prevent them from being enforced;723825723;1;3;5;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
the obvious conclusion is that the left just believes that enforcing immigration law is illegal;723825723;5;1;5;1;1;5;1;1;1;5
a mans sister told him a group of boaters witnessed an aerial explosion offshore around 800 am  last saturday morning  south pacific intellihub   a man posted a video to youtube on sunday in which he claims his sister who lives on maui heard that a group of 9 tour boat guides and about 13 tourists witnessed some type of explosion in the sky about 100 nm offshore leeward side;724347953;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;5;1;1
they said it looked like a meteor and then all of a sudden it was a big boom and it lit up the entire sky  he explained;724347953;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;5;1;1
it was at eight oclock in the morning;724347953;1;1;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1

i would think that the united states would not want to cause more panic if they did launch something at hawaii   they would say it was a mistake;724347953;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;5;1;1

thats no doubt what made him a rising star;726151605;5;5;5;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
mike sanders a former jackson county executive prosecutor and once a rising star in missouris democratic party is now a convicted felon after pleading guilty friday afternoon to a federal corruption charge;726151605;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
but no doubt he was just redistributing the wealth to the people;726151605;5;3;5;5;1;3;5;1;1;3
sanders admitted in court to misusing tens of thousands of dollars for his personal gain including trips to california wine country;726151605;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;3;1;1
sanders longtime friend aide and chief of staff calvin williford sobbed after pleading guilty at a separate hearing earlier friday to one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud;726151605;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
he testified that he and sanders used campaign cash for gambling trips to las vegas;726151605;1;5;1;3;1;1;1;1;1;1
im shocked that another dem apparatchik was living the good life with misappropriated money;726151605;5;3;5;0;1;5;1;1;3;1
as sanders chief of staff williford oversaw a program that gave houses to needy families and helped arrange the purchase of the rock island rail line through kansas city which will one day connect to the crossstate katy trail one day;726151605;1;5;3;3;1;1;1;1;1;1
after winning his first term as jackson county executive in 2007 sanders political future looked bright in missouri;726151605;1;5;1;3;1;1;1;1;1;1
he would later become chairman of the missouri democratic party from 2011 to 2013 and drew no serious opposition in his two bids for reelection as jackson county executive;726151605;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
sanders was often rumored as a possible successor to us rep  emanuel cleaver whenever he decided to leave congress;726151605;1;5;1;3;1;1;1;1;1;1
he still could be;726151605;1;5;3;0;1;1;1;1;1;3
america cant pay its bills after spending decades and trillions of dollars on global hegemony;729029241;3;5;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;3
with our wars unwon and our veterans often unable to access the care they need to cope with the wounds both physical and psychological of battle president donald trump believes its the perfect time for a sovietstyle show of military might in the streets of washington dc;729029241;1;5;3;3;1;1;1;1;3;3
the president was reportedly so impressed by the military displays during a bastille day parade he observed in france last year that hes directed the pentagon officials to put on something similar here in the us;729029241;1;5;1;3;1;1;1;1;1;1
this is being worked at the highest levels of the military  a pentagon insider told the washington post;729029241;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
how much will it cost;729029241;1;5;1;0;5;1;1;1;1;1
well no one really seems to know;729029241;5;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
defense secretary james mattis dodged when a reporter asked why the pentagon would spend time and money putting on a tank parade when the government is in the red and we havent won any of our recent wars;729029241;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;5;1;3
i think what my responsibility is to make certain i lay out the strategy and make the argument for the oversight of congress to make the determination of fully funding us;729029241;5;5;1;1;1;1;1;3;5;1
as far as the parade goes again the presidents respect his fondness for the military i think is reflected in him asking for these options  mattis said;729029241;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;5;1;5
there are many people who see the parade idea otherwise saying its a show of force out of line with american tradition;729029241;3;5;3;1;1;1;1;5;1;3
as npr reported;729029241;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1

as i figured would be the case putins message to the west that russia cannot be intimidated and that the nations must work together to deal with world problems was far over the heads of the dumbshit exceptional  americans;735922239;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
cnn rushed out an idiot named samantha vinograd who served as a staffer on obamas national security council to declare that putins speech was only aimed at one person in the world president trump;735922239;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
putin the idiot samantha vinograd says is poking at trumps insecurities  with the threat that my missiles are bigger than yours;735922239;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
the stupid samantha vinograd repeats the lie that russiagate was putins plot to destabilize the united states;735922239;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1;3
so how is the us  a superpower when russia controls us  elections;735922239;5;1;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
doesnt this mean that americans are of no relevance whatsoever in the world;735922239;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1;5
i mean really;735922239;5;1;5;0;1;1;1;1;1;5
with intelligence levels this low on obamas national security council no wonder the neoonservatives were able to run over the obama regime and resurrect the cold war thus returning the world to a high chance of nuclear armageddon;735922239;3;1;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1
the idiot samantha vinograd says the solution is more sanctions on russia;735922239;5;1;3;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
she is the epitomy of einsteins rule that insanity is to continue doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results;735922239;5;1;3;3;1;1;1;1;1;1
all the illegal sanctions did was to produce russian military superiority over the utter fools in washington;735922239;5;1;3;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
i really do not think that there is enough intelligence in washington for the world to allow washington to have an independent foreign policy;735922239;5;1;3;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
the world wont be safe until the government of the united states is committed to an insane asylum;735922239;5;1;3;1;1;1;1;5;1;1

com8481iyj9ox  qatarileaks a site which has been reporting on abuses from the terror kingdom has chosen to spotlight front page magazines reporting in this video and chart;738599948;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
the video is based on front page magazines story forget russia what about qatar;738599948;1;5;1;1;1;1;5;1;1;1
qatars influence operations took an ominous turn when elliott broidy a top trump donor had his emails hacked by individuals he alleges were qatari agents the leaked emails play into qatars conflict with the uae the emails have predictably popped up on al jazeera and broidy had previously been targeted by the intercept for a panel at which steve bannon had criticized qatar;738599948;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
we have reason to believe this hack was sponsored and carried out by registered and unregistered agents of qatar seeking to punish mr broidy for his strong opposition to statesponsored terrorism broidys spokesman said;738599948;1;5;1;1;1;1;5;1;1;1
these two incidents of alleged qatari espionage against americans in order to influence our foreign policy raise serious questions;738599948;1;5;1;3;1;1;1;1;1;1
yet the same media that obsessively searches for russian bots on reddit and facebook seems entirely disinterested in discussing the subject;738599948;1;5;1;3;1;1;1;1;1;1
skeptics of russian influence have been told to put country ahead of party but when will the left finally put country ahead of qatar;738599948;1;5;1;1;5;1;1;1;1;1
perversely instead of investigating the role of qatar in influencing american elections mueller is reportedly taking the qatari propaganda at face value and directing his investigation accordingly;738599948;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
slovakia april 27 2018  the remnant press  on friday his eminence raymond cardinal burke gave a lecture on the indissolubility of marriage in bratislava slovakia;754526841;1;3;1;3;1;1;5;1;1;1
the theater which held 160 seats was filled to capacity with participants lining the sides of the theater;754526841;1;5;1;3;1;1;1;1;1;3
although there were a few dissenters with posters standing outside the theater denouncing the cardinals stance on homosexuality and how it is an evil in todays society the cardinal was warmly welcomed inside the theater to a throng of expectant catholics eagerly awaiting his arrival;754526841;5;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
cardinal burke spoke for an hour on a variety of topics including but not limited to the attacks on the church from within the moral degradation of our society and the impurity of those entering the state of holy matrimony the reasons for his disagreement with pope francis on the encyclical amoris laetitia the significance of living a good moral life through prayer and penance and the importance of parents instilling in their children a love for jesus and his blessed mother mary;754526841;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;3;1;1
the remaining half hour was a question and answer format;754526841;3;1;3;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
it was interesting to listen to the cardinals responses to genuine questions of those seeking clarity on topics that have been muddy in recent years such as homosexuals and their place in the church the role of the traditional latin mass in attracting a younger generation and restoring the church and the reasons behind the growing number of broken catholic marriages;754526841;1;1;1;3;1;1;1;1;1;1
unfortunately not all questions were answers due to limited time however it was evident that the audience was very supportive of cardinal burkes stance on these divisive topics;754526841;5;1;3;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
here is an excerpt of his speech from gloriatv;754526841;5;3;3;3;1;1;1;1;1;1
his speech included such statements as;754526841;5;1;1;1;1;1;1;3;1;1
can the president of the united states obstruct justice;761236868;5;5;5;0;5;1;1;1;5;1
possibly;761236868;5;3;5;0;1;1;1;1;3;1
but theres a fairly high bar for such an accusation;761236868;5;5;5;5;1;1;1;1;5;1
far higher than for an ordinary person;761236868;5;3;5;5;1;1;1;1;3;1
not because the president is a dictator as some lefties have accused but because the executive branch bears responsibility for the doj;761236868;5;1;5;5;1;3;5;1;3;3
and the argument that team coup keeps making is that any interference with its investigation is obstruction of justice;761236868;1;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;5;1
nope;761236868;5;3;5;0;1;1;1;1;1;3
if that were the case obama and plenty of his predecessors would have committed obstruction of justice a thousand times over;761236868;3;1;5;5;1;3;1;1;1;1
the president of the united states has the right to set policy;761236868;1;5;1;3;1;1;1;1;3;1
that includes policy for the doj;761236868;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
if the president believes that the russia investigation is a waste of time he has the right to shred it;761236868;1;3;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;3
if he wants to tell top officials to drop it he can do that;761236868;1;3;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;3
if the left wants to claim obstruction of justice it has to first find a core crime;761236868;1;3;1;5;1;3;1;1;3;3
it cant simply claim that hes obstructing justice;761236868;1;3;3;3;1;1;1;1;3;3
in their house of mirrors any white house direction on a counterintelligence investigation somehow morphs into obstruction of justice;761236868;1;1;3;5;1;3;1;1;1;3
no and no;761236868;5;3;5;3;1;1;1;1;1;3
team coup has yet to identify how the russians rigged the election election truther conspiracy 1 and what crime any americans committed during that process;761236868;5;3;5;3;1;5;1;1;3;5
it refuses to do that;761236868;1;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;5;1
instead it waves its arms pounds the pulpit and classifies its claims;761236868;5;1;5;3;1;3;1;1;5;5
and then it throws out perjury and obstruction of justice threats;761236868;1;1;5;5;1;3;1;5;5;5
no no and no;761236868;5;3;3;3;1;1;1;1;5;3
thats not how america works;761236868;3;3;5;3;1;3;1;1;5;5
and there is no justice for the president to obstruct;761236868;3;5;5;3;1;5;1;1;5;5
unleashing partisan conspiracy theorists on a fishing expedition is not justice;761236868;5;5;5;3;1;5;1;1;5;5
it certainly doesnt trump the powers of the executive;761236868;5;5;5;3;1;1;1;3;5;5
