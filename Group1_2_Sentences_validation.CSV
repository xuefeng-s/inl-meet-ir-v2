now the idea that you would even put up with me for a quarter of a century is a remarkable testament to what a saintly wonderful patient person you are he said;147xxx;1;5;1;1;1;1;5;1;1;1
it was a lot easier for me to do it because the fact of the matter is that not only have you been an extraordinary partner not only have you been a great friend somebody who could always make me laugh somebody who would always make sure that i was following what i thought was right but you have also been an example to our daughters and to the entire country;147xxx;1;5;1;1;1;1;5;1;1;1
his sentiments came after michelle had posted a photo from their 1992 wedding on instagram with a message of love for the former president on their anniversary;147xxx;3;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
your strength your grace your determination your honesty the fact that you look so good doing all this the way in which youve always taken responsibility for your own actions but also for looking out for the people around you is remarkable he continued;147xxx;1;5;1;1;1;1;5;1;1;1
and its no wonder that as people got to know you the way that i got to know you they fell in love;147xxx;1;5;1;1;1;1;5;1;1;1
his message was the latest example of the type of genuine affection between the two that was often on display in many touching moments throughout the eight years they were in the white house;147xxx;3;5;3;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
barack and michelle have been together since 1989 when he met her while working as a summer associate at a chicago law firm where she worked;147xxx;1;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
it is truly the best decision that i ever made to be persistent enough asking you out on a date that you finally gave in he said;147xxx;1;5;1;1;1;1;5;1;1;1
and i hope you feel the same way so i dont want to interrupt the flow of what im sure is a fascinating discussion but i figured that you wouldnt mind maybe me parachuting in just to say how much i love you and how much i appreciate you;147xxx;1;5;1;1;1;1;5;1;1;1

her vanity comes before our vets in a slap in the face to america’s courageous wounded warriors first lady michelle obama used walter reed army medical center as her own personal outpatient plastic surgery clinic the national enquirer has learned;148zzz;3;1;3;1;1;1;1;3;1;1
“it’s appalling” fumed jill farrell of judicial watch “with taxpayers picking up the tab for her ski trips to aspen and beach outings to hawaii we might as well pay for her abs and butt too”;148zzz;1;1;1;1;1;1;5;1;3;1
michelle was whisked to the hospital with “the utmost secrecy” in the summer of 2011 a source told the enquirer;148zzz;1;5;1;1;1;1;3;1;1;1
“secret service agents were stationed both inside and outside the operating room michelle had fat sucked from her abdomen hips and butt”;148zzz;1;5;1;1;1;1;5;1;1;1
while such procedures can take up to two hours “she was done in 45 minutes to an hour”;148zzz;1;5;1;1;1;1;5;1;1;1
what’s more the source added “when elective surgery is done even if it’s cosmetic the surgeon’s fee is waived;148zzz;1;5;1;1;1;1;5;1;1;1
if michelle paid anything it would have been just for the anesthesiologist;148zzz;1;5;1;5;1;3;1;1;1;1
“because michelle is first lady though i wouldn’t be surprised if the government picked up the total tab meaning taxpayers forked over their hardearned dollars to satisfy her vanity”;148zzz;1;5;1;0;1;1;5;1;1;1
the enquirer has also learned michelle 51 has likely had more than just liposuction at such military facilities;148zzz;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1

“i can also see the rhinoplasty work she had done is very obvious it is superb sophisticated work though”;148zzz;1;5;1;1;1;1;5;1;1;1
dr otto placik said michelle now has fewer crow’s feet indicating she’s had “definite botox” as well as a hollywoodready smile;148zzz;1;3;1;1;1;1;1;3;1;1
he added “her lips are fuller indicating fillers into both upper and lower lips besides that her marionette lines running down from the corners of her mouth are almost completely gone”;148zzz;1;3;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
respected plastic surgeon dr steven dayan added “she has a decrease in the height of her smile which can happen when a lot of filler is placed in the cheeks and smile lines”;148zzz;1;5;1;1;1;1;5;1;1;1
the experts’ conclusions further incensed jill who charged “michelle obama is taking up needed space while veterans are awaiting care and suffering it’s a crying shame”;148zzz;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;3;3
ellen degeneres is now in the middle of kelly ripa and michael strahan’s feud after segment on her show;155zzz;1;3;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1

the two popular tv personalities tackled various topics;155zzz;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
the episode was well received and the millions of people who watched it saw nothing out of the ordinary;155zzz;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
however according to sources who spoke to star portia de rossi’s wife is having what would be considered as buyer’s remorse;155zzz;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
it is being claimed that the host of live did not appreciate degeneres’ having her nemesis on the show;155zzz;1;5;1;5;1;1;1;3;1;1
according to the the the publication ripa felt betrayed by degeneres whom she considered as a friend;155zzz;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;3;1;1
aware that she got on ripa’s nerves degeneres has allegedly reached out and apologized for the mistake;155zzz;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
it is not known if ripa has accepted such apology nor if the ladies have been able to amend their friendship;155zzz;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
the former american football defensive end and ripa were the cohosts of live with kelly and michael from 2012 to 2016;155zzz;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
in spring 2016 he abruptly left the show to join abc morning television show good morning america;155zzz;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1
the exathlete was slammed on numerous occasions by ripa who said she was furious over strahan’s decision to dump her without warning;155zzz;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;5;1;1
strahan hit back by stating “the most disappointing thing to me was that i was painted as the bad guy because i value the way i carry myself i do not want people to see me as ‘oh he just ran out just left them there’ that is just not true”;155zzz;1;3;1;1;1;1;5;1;1;1
strahan confirmed that they no longer talk;155zzz;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;3;1;1
in a past interview he said “at one point i think we were friends i do not know what happened at the end i learned a lot from her though”;155zzz;1;5;1;1;1;1;5;1;1;1
he added “i was not surprised by her reaction at all but i cannot control somebody else’s actions i was there four years and it is about more than just being in front of the camera”;155zzz;1;5;1;1;1;1;5;1;1;1
an article recently appeared on bet where an insider said strahan wants to have a sitdown with ripa;155zzz;1;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
the source revealed “michael is 100 behind meeting with kelly and clearing the air these two were tvhusbandandwife for many years and to go from seeing someone five days a week to having zero contact makes no sense to him through mutual friends michael has made it clear that he would love to set up drinks or a private meeting with kelly”;155zzz;1;5;1;1;1;1;5;1;1;1
it is being claimed ripa has turned him down;155zzz;1;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1

the mystery of how kendall met the hadids has been solved;239xxx;5;5;3;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
not too long ago kendall jenner and gigi hadid were just two young unconnected girls who occasionally appeared on their family members reality television show;239xxx;1;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
then the world blinked and all the sudden they were burgeoning supermodels and super influencers;239xxx;5;5;3;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
then the world blinked again and they were bonafide supermodel bffs;239xxx;5;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
another blink and their sisters kylie and bella were also burgeoning influence and burgeoning models in their own right;239xxx;1;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
one more blink and theyre now four of the most famous young women on the entire planet and they all hang out with each other in various groupings and form the core of one of the most powerful girl squads in the entire world;239xxx;1;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
of this we all know and yet what we did not know is how any of them actually came to actually know each other and became friends in the first place;239xxx;1;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
there were simple guesses kendall and gigi just met on the fashion circuit and took a liking to one another;239xxx;5;5;5;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
there were more complicated guesses based on the fact that the two pairs of sisters are sort of related in the way that all european royal families are sort of related—through a complicated string of marriages and divorces;239xxx;5;5;5;3;1;1;1;1;1;1
the story before kris jenner the jenners father caitlyn—née bruce—used to be married to a woman named linda and after their divorce linda married the composer david foster;239xxx;1;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
linda and david also got divorced and then the hadids mother yolanda married david after her first marriage to the sisters biological father mohamed;239xxx;1;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
naturally yolanda and david are now divorced as well;239xxx;1;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
so maybe some assumed they just met at a very awkward extended family reunion of sorts;239xxx;5;5;5;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
as it happens that is not the case;239xxx;3;5;1;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
earlier this year came a stunning new clue in the mystery;239xxx;1;3;1;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
while everyone thought that it was kendall and gigi who were the original nexus of the friendship web it turned out that kendall was actually friends with bella first;239xxx;3;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
now finally after far too long spent thinking about this we have a definitive answer and it is way way more mundane and even a bit geekier than we ever imagined;239xxx;5;5;5;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
i met her for the first time seven years ago over twitter bella told instyle;239xxx;1;5;1;1;1;1;5;1;1;1
“that was before we started modeling i was probably 14 or 15 we met up and had sushi and now we’re best friends she’s a pretty significant human i met online”;239xxx;1;5;1;1;1;1;5;1;1;1
while there is still shame in this world about admitting youve met anyone online the fact that two of the most popular girls in the world did so back when they were 14 or 15 should satisfy everyone and once and for all any questions about how the jenners met the hadids;239xxx;5;5;5;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
strathmore company in geneva has informed the city the business will be printing another propane safety pamphlet which has previously generated a natural gaslike odor detectable in the community;727162426;1;5;1;5;1;1;1;3;1;1
strathmore which operates on gary lane will be conducting its latest production run from 6 am to 6 pm jan31 to friday feb 2 as well as monday through wednesday feb  5 to 7;727162426;1;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
the company is printing materials for a customer that has a small scratchandsniff area being applied;727162426;1;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
the scent being used for the scratchandsniff contains mercaptan the same odorant that is added to natural gas to make it noticeable;727162426;1;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
mercaptan is a harmless organic substance made of carbon hydrogen and sulphur that is detectable to the human nose at levels of less than one part per million;727162426;1;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
since natural gas in its pure state does not have a smell mercaptan is the ideal additive to colorless odorless gases so they can be identified well before they reach hazardous levels;727162426;1;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
residents in the vicinity may periodically smell the mercaptan from the companys exhaust depending on current wind speed and direction;727162426;1;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
there is no danger being posed to the community from this commercial print job;727162426;1;5;1;0;1;1;1;1;1;1
the company has printed three similar brochures in the past year;727162426;1;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
however should people believe an odor is stemming from another source or if they have knowledge of an actual natural gas leak please call 911 immediately to report the incident;727162426;1;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
residents with questions regarding the print production smell can call the geneva fire department at 6302322530;727162426;1;5;1;5;1;1;1;1;1;1
