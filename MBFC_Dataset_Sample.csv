From Cosmopolitan

Prince Harry and Prince William's feud was ""incredibly intense"" and ""ugly.""

The brothers have vowed to never let things get that ""out of hand"" again.

Harry and William are planning to reunite in-person in 2021.

Prince Harry and Prince William's relationship is finally back on track after their *breathes exhausted sigh* royal feud, but a source tells Us Weekly their drama was way more intense than anyone realized.

“William and Harry’s fallout was very real, very ugly, and incredibly intense,” the source said. “They’d reached an impasse, there was so much mud under the bridge and a lot of people felt their feud was beyond repair.”

Apparently, William and Harry are now ""vowing not to let things get this out of hand in the future and have learned a lot from this difficult experience”—and there's been ""a lot of rejoicing"" in the royal family now that they've reconciled.

While Harry and William haven't reunited due to COVID-19 restrictions, they are ""looking forward to spending time together in person the moment it’s safe to travel."" The brothers' reunion will likely take place in England, but the source notes ""at some point in 2021, the Cambridges will travel to Santa Barbara and see the Sussexes on their new home turf.""

Glad everyone's getting along!

Gwen Stefani is reflecting on her ""magical"" engagement story with Blake Shelton.

The ""Hollaback Girl"" singer recalled that she ""didn't have any idea"" that Shelton would propose to her despite having dated for five years. The two announced their engagement on social media on Oct. 27.

""Wasn't expecting it at the moment that it happened, at all. Didn't have any idea, nobody knew,"" Stefani said while appearing on Tuesday’s episode of ""The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon.""

""I think he had told my dad on my birthday about two weeks earlier, and I gotta tell you, I was sorta like, 'What's happening with us?'""

Despite her surprised reaction, Stefani admitted that she used to wonder if her husband-to-be was ever going to propose.

""It was kind of in my mind like, 'We've been together a long time now. What's going on?' I was in that place in my head,"" she revealed.

'I heard a YES': Blake Shelton and Gwen Stefani are engaged

She then elaborated on the story leading up to the engagement, which occurred during a trip to Oklahoma that she initially wanted to cancel due to COVID-19 concerns.

""We also had this trip planned to come to Oklahoma, and it was one of those COVID kind of, not a fight, but it was like, ‘Maybe we should just cancel the trip. This is getting too hard. Everybody has to get tested,'"" she explained.

However, Stefani said the two ended up taking the trip, where Shelton popped the momentous question.

""We ended up making it all happen ... but it was like everybody was trying to make it not happen, because nobody knew it was going to happen, and Blake, meanwhile, had this ring.""

So, when's the wedding?

Stefani said they still have ""no plans because of the pandemic.""

""It's like, Blake, why couldn't you have done it before! Now we can't have a wedding with the pandemic. It's like sitting around going, 'OK, drag it out more!'""

SAG Awards 'Extremely Disappointed' by Grammys' Move to Same Date,"RELATED STORIES Grammys Postponed Due to COVID

Grammys Postponed Due to COVID TVLine Items: Conan Leaves Home, Stranger Things Nabs 'Enoch' and More

The decision to move the Grammys to the same date in March as this year’s Screen Actors Guild Awards has hit a sour note with organizers of the latter event.

The Recording Academy announced on Tuesday that due to “the deteriorating COVID situation in Los Angeles, with hospital services being overwhelmed, ICUs having reached capacity, and new guidance from state and local governments,” the semi-virtual 63rd annual Grammy Awards would move from Sunday, Jan. 31 to Sunday, March 14.

The thing is, the SAG Awards — which traditionally are held in mid- to late January — announced way back in July that, because of pandemic-related considerations, it would not hold its 2021 ceremony until March 14. (In turn, the SAG Awards extended its eligibility period for movies and TV programs by two months, through to Feb. 28.)

“We are extremely disappointed to hear of the conflicting date, March 14th, announced today for this year’s Grammy Awards telecast,” SAG-AFTRA said in a statement cited by our sister site Deadline. “We announced the same date for the SAG Awards last July with the intent to give the greatest possible scheduling consideration for other awards shows. We expect the same consideration from sister organizations throughout the industry.”

Like the SAG Awards, both the Golden Globes (to be hosted by Tina Fey and Amy Poehler) and the Academy Awards moved back their scheduled 2021 ceremonies by two months — to Feb. 28 and April 25, respectively.",['Matt Webb Mitovich'],https://news.google.com,high
JoJo Siwa issues statement after board game with her name is deemed inappropriate by parents,"JoJo Siwa spoke out after lending her name to a board game for kids that some parents deemed inappropriate.

Nickelodeon recently released a board game for kids called ""JoJo’s Juice,"" with questions for players to answer, but the 17-year-old influencer claims she was unaware of all of the content.

Page Six reported that some parents were upset to see questions such as: ""Have you ever walked in on someone naked or had someone walk in on you?"" and ""Have you ever gone outside without underwear (a bathing suit doesn’t count)?""

""We respect and value the relationship JoJo Siwa has with her fans and take the concerns raised regarding the game 'JoJo’s Juice' very seriously. This game is no longer being manufactured and we have requested that retailers pull any remaining product from their shelves,"" reads a joint statement from Nickelodeon and Spin Master provided to Fox News.

On Tuesday, the popular celebrity took to Instagram to share a video message explaining the situation and come out unequivocally against the board game.

""When companies make these games, they don’t run every aspect by me and so I had no idea of the types of questions that were on these playing cards,"" she continued.

Denmark releases children’s show about man with ‘world’s longest penis’,"John Dillermand is a new children’s TV show in Denmark (Picture: DR)

Denmark has released a brand new children’s show about a man with the world’s longest penis. Yes, 2021 is already shaping up to be another wild year.

John Dillermand is an animated series aimed at four to eight-year-olds that follows a man and his oversized ‘pee-pee’ – and his big penis often lands him into worrying situations.

In the show’s first episode, for example, John found himself floating over the city after balloons became tied to his groin.

‘We think it’s important to be able to tell stories about bodies,’ public broadcaster DR posted on Facebook on Tuesday.

‘In the series, we recognise (young children’s) growing curiosity about their bodies and genitals, as well as embarrassment and pleasure in the body.’

The controversial show’s opening title includes the lyrics: ‘He has the world’s longest pee-pee/There’s almost nothing he can’t do with it

‘He has the world’s longest pee-pee/He swings it around, he can get a little embarrassed/He can save the world if he’s allowed.’

Unsurprisngly, John Dillermand has divided viewers, with some claiming it is inappropriate for children.

‘This is outrageous!’ one fumed on YouTube. ‘Our children shouldn’t have to witness this, we need to CANCEL this ASAP!!!’

Meanwhile, another viewer no doubt echoed the thoughts of many, and wrote: ‘I can’t believe this is real.’

The Guardian reports that DR responded to criticism of the show by saying it could just as easily have made a programme ‘about a woman with no control over her vagina’.

They added that the ‘most important thing was that children enjoyed John Dillermand.’

"6 This Is Us Tissue Moments: Randall's Mother's Fate Revealed, Kate Confronts Marc After Pregnancy","NBC

Once again, Kevin finds himself torn between the family life he wants and the career he's been chasing for 20 years.

Unlike in seasons past, ""This Is Us"" wasted no time in telling us exactly what happened with Randall's mother -- and this seemingly just after we'd discovered that she survived that drug overdose after he was born.

In fact, this episode was filled with so many more answers than questions, we found ourselves oddly satisfied and a little confused if we were still watching ""This Is Us."" That's not what this show does. It peels back one layer of the onion to uncover half a dozen more.

This week, though, we got clarity as to just what the unspoken tension is between Kevin and Madison as he continues to dig into the most challenging role of his career and she continues to make two babies inside her body.

We quickly got confirmation as to what happened with Kate and that pregnancy test, including not one but two reunions with Marc to offer closure on that storyline as well. And then there's Randall, who moved quickly past his topless dance scene -- kudos to Jae-Won for the beautiful tribute -- to getting answers about his mother, Laurel.

It was all just so warm and beautiful and fulfilling, we found ourselves with far less anxiety than usual by the end of it. Instead, we were left feeling oddly satisfied even as there are still lingering questions.

As we do every week, we're going to single out the show's most powerful moments, scoring them by how many tissues we tore through just to watch them. Believe us, these are happy tears of anguish.

""You Were Broken in All the Right Places""

We weren't so sure it was a good idea for Kate to try and confront Marc after all these years, but then we remembered that this isn't the same broken and weak Kate we first met four seasons ago. This is a strong, driven woman who's really come into her confidence and her own. We also saw evidence that it was always there.

We saw it when Kate went to see Marc after having decided to get an abortion at 18 years old, only to quickly learn that he hadn't changed at all. He wasn't ready for this responsibility or really any responsibility.

And the confronting him as an adult, she was right to say he looked small. He looked pathetic and weak. He still hasn't changed, still the short-tempered loser with no real ambitions. His is a dead-end life she was right to escape and right to free herself from (both back then and now).

""I Have Gone and Fallen in Love with the Idea of Our Family""

With each passing episode, are falling more and more in love with this couple, even as they are facing an incredibly difficult speed bump on their own road toward happiness. Can they navigate it? Honestly, we're not completely sure.

We know the cabin is in Kevin's future, and the kids, but is Madison? Is his career? Because that's what became crystal clear this week. Madison's vision of the family they want to build together is a family with a stable home for the kids to grow up in.

Meanwhile, Kevin just kind of figured it would be that superstar actor's lifestyle where they travel to film sets as needed and just bring the kids and their nannies along with them. Both are viable paths, but they are not the same path. And it looks like Madison is not going to budge.

Kevin has been chasing this opportunity in his career for two decades and he's on the cusp of really taking it to the next level. And yet, we could see him walking away from it all for the sake of family, as that's also been his dream. Can he find a compromise? Walk away without him resenting Madison or her feeling bad?

Who knew that Kevin would carry the most compelling and uncertain storyline on the show, but it's all his right now. We know where Kate and Toby are, and we're pretty clear on Randall and Beth at this point. Kevin's path, though we know somewhat where it goes, remains cloudy -- and we're absolutely invested in it.

""I'm Not Carrying It a Moment Longer""

As if we needed any more proof of the badass, strong woman Kate has become, we loved that she just called adult Marc out for what a loser he is. It was a cathartic and brutally honest moment, as she shed years of baggage with that single line.

She showed that same strength in the past when she walked out on him mid-visit after he also revealed his true colors then, as well. He is a sad, pathetic little man who manipulates and takes advantage of broken people.

The fact that Marc, as an adult, told Kate that she was broken in all the right places really put his world-view into perspective. He knew exactly what he was doing when he toyed with her emotions, using and abusing her because he's too weak to even try to take on a mentally healthy woman.

Seeing that he's not grown at all in the intervening decades was all Kate needed to lose that baggage for good. Seeing her laughing with Toby at the end while watching ""Airplane,"" takes her full circle to seeing her parents laughing at the film. Always theirs was that impossible fairy tale romance, and now that is her story.

But even better, she doesn't need a knight in shining armor to save her all the time because she's strong enough to do it herself. That said, it's still nice to know that said knight is armored up and on standby as needed.

""I'm So Pleased to Hear From You""

We knew that there was more to the story of Laurel's life that we needed to learn, but it was still painful to hear Randall admit he was afraid to unpack any of it because it would mean (he suspected) that William had lied to him.

In evidence of his continued growth, after first rebuffing talking to his therapist about receiving Hai Lang's letter about his mother, Randall did open up about it. And it was there that he came to realize that he has been chasing clarity on who he is his whole life, so he can't stop now.

And he certainly can't stop because of assumptions he's making based on partial information. Thankfully, he made the decision to call the man who knew his mother until her death from breast cancer in 2015. Here he can fill in those gaps, good and bad, to find out what happened and maybe why she never sought him out.

What we didn't expect was to be moved by Hai's response when Randall called, nor that he'd wanted for years to reach out to him. This means so much, in that it shows how big Hai's heart is, but also that Laurel knew about her son and talked about him.

There are so many more questions to be answered here (and it looks like next week will go all the way there and answer them), but it was heartwarming to see that there will be nothing but kindness and love on this journey for Randall.

""What Would Randall Do?""

There remains a lot of existing damage between Randall and Kevin, but as siblings do, they are starting to work through it. Kevin telling Randall that he goes through life asking himself what his brother would do was touching.

It also, unfortunately, was just the beginning of a difficult conversation Randall was clearly not ready to have, as he cut Kevin off to instead call Hai and begin that journey. We get it, Randall has a lot on his mind right now, but he's not the only one.

Kevin failed totally to articulate the real reason he was calling, which was his uncertainty about what to do at this crossroads in his life. A flashback to an earlier phone call from Randall gave us a hint as to how it might go.

That call came shortly after Kevin and Sophie had married and Kevin was being invited to LA to audition for pilot season, leaving Sophie behind in New York for school. Young Randall was worried that choosing his career over Sophie could ruin their relationship.

Sounds pretty solidly like Kevin is thinking about that decision, and the fact that he and Sophie did not work out, so he was wanting to again feel out Randall's instinct about this similar situation.

We think we know what Randall would do, but this is the guy who became a city councilman and moved his whole family to Philadelphia for his career, so maybe the water's not as clear at 40 as it was at 20.

Still, we loved seeing those tender moments and baby steps as the men came closer and closer to actually having the real unspoken conversation about their long and complicated relationship. Those baby steps, regrets and slight apologies are a huge move in that direction.

""He Was Telling You What He Thought Was the Truth""

With one hard question and one quick answer, Hai Lang was able to put Randall's mind at ease, maintaining the purity and sanctity of his relationship with his birth father, William. With one answer, William remains a decent man in Randall's mind.

Hai may never realize just how important it was, but everything about that moment resonated so beautifully, we were as breathless as Randall. Thank goodness Beth was there to pick up the torch and continue the conversation.

Thanks to that clarity about his relationship with William, Randall was in a place to make Hai's very sweet wish that he could share the places Laurel loved to go and the things she loved to do become reality.

We can already tell we're going to have to stock up all over again on tissues before next week's deep dive into the life of Laurel. As beautiful as William's story wound up being, it looks like Laurel also was able to get clean and carry on to live a beautiful life of her own.

We are just as curious as Randall as to why she never sought him out, or William for that matter. William never moved, and she obviously knew that her son existed. But how much did she know about either of them?

Will the answers Hai is able to provide give Randall the same sense of closure about his identity that Kate's been able to gain about hers? Could he at last find some peace with where he comes from on his way to reconciling his place in the world and his adopted family?

Steve Trevor’s Death Will Reportedly Be Retconned In The Flash,"One of the major talking points surrounding Wonder Woman 1984 was the return of Chris Pine’s Steve Trevor, although it had little to do with the actor’s typically charming presence. Instead, most of the focus was placed on the plot device used to bring him back from the dead, which left a lot of people feeling uneasy the more that they thought about it.

Patty Jenkins has brushed off the criticism, but there are already rumors making the rounds that Pine will be back again for Wonder Woman 3, even though he’s technically been killed off twice and the third installment is poised to be the first one set in the modern day, which would force the creative team to come up with yet another far-fetched explanation as to why he’s still around over 100 years later.

Now, insider Grace Randolph is claiming that the 40 year-old is being lined up for a cameo in The Flash, which would see Barry Allen save him just in time and pretty much wipe the entirety of Wonder Woman 1984 from canon. Not only that, but the Scarlet Speedster will reportedly stow him away on Themyscira, which would slow down the aging process and keep Pine’s handsome features intact for Wonder Woman 3.

“Warner Bros., I hear is considering bringing Steve Trevor back again via Flashpoint where the Flash saves him from the plane explosion just in the nick of time,” says Randolph.

Take this one with a pinch of salt, because it would only serve to create some massive plot holes for the DCEU. Barry’s powers have the capabilities to slow down time and even traverse through alternate dimensions and realities, but there’s been no basis in the franchise so far for him to jump backwards by a century just to save his teammate’s beau.

Not only that, but stashing Steve on Themyscira would then make Diana look like an idiot as she spends the next few decades longing for him while he’s perfectly safe on the island she calls home, and as of yet, there’s no word on if Gal Gadot is even going to appear in The Flash anyway.",['Scott Campbell'],https://news.google.com,high
New Investor in 2021? Here Are 3 Stocks to Build Your Portfolio Around,"If you're just getting started in the stock market, I'm jealous. I remember how exciting it was at the beginning of my investing journey more than three decades now. You will win. You will lose. And if you do things right, you will learn from every revelation.

Picking your first stocks is a pretty big deal. I would love to boil down my advice to finding a company you admire in an industry you feel that you know better than most people, but obviously that's a personal journey. If I had to start right now -- and, again, lucky you -- I would have to go with Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS), Target (NYSE:TGT), and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) as the ideal best building blocks for your new portfolio.

Disney

If content is king you can't go wrong with The Lion King. You won't find a bigger name in entertainment than Disney. Back in 2019 -- the last year that the multiplex was relevant -- Disney had all six of the country's highest grossing films. Disney operates the world's most popular theme parks. You've probably heard of ESPN, ABC, Marvel, Hulu, Pixar, and Star Wars.

Despite a rough 2020 that ended with some of its theme parks closed and Disney holding back on theatrical releases as a result of the pandemic the stock hit an all-time high on the final trading day of the year. Everything that the media giant has going for it is coming together in Disney+, the streaming TV service that has managed to attract 86.8 million paid subscribers in less than 13 months of service.

Disney+ is currently just 7% of Disney's revenue, but it's growing up in a hurry. Mining its Marvel, Lucasfilm, and Pixar properties for shows and movies that will stream exclusively on the platform is going to keep customers close. Fans won't flinch at the 14% price increase that is coming in March. Disney sees as many as 260 million subs by the end of fiscal 2024, and if that seems high keep in mind that the media mogul has been woefully conservative so far. Disney is disrupting its own business, and investors couldn't be happier.

Target

Let's get some dividend payments into your portfolio. Capital gains will always trump interest income in a portfolio, but there's nothing wrong with quarterly treats as reminders for being an investor. Target's yield of 1.5% may not seem like much, but it's tied to one of the most impressive brick-and-mortar retailers.

Target's always had the right balance when it comes to mass market retail. It wears the ""cheap chic"" distinction with pride, and that makes it the cool place for penny pinchers to shop. Target is an all-weather winner. When the economy's buzzing of course it's going to hold up nicely. Here in a recession it's more than earning its keep as shoppers try to get more bang for the buck.

The bull's-eye logo has been a great place for investors aim these days. Comps skyrocketed nearly 21% in its its latest quarter. Adjusted earnings more than doubled. Target's not a shrinking violet when it comes to the digital future. Between online ordering for in-store and curbside pick-up as well as old-fashioned e-commerce Target's digital sales soared 155% in its latest quarter.

Amazon.com

Making two retailers part of your first three-stock portfolio may not seem to provide the diversification investors seek, but it's not fair to paint the country's third most valuable company by market cap as just a shopkeep. Amazon is a tech giant.

Amazon has cracked the code on speedy delivery of all goods. It's a leading provider of cloud-hosting services. It operates the top live streaming platform for gamers. Its Prime Video streaming service is just one of the digital entertainment offerings that make it more like Disney than Target in many regards.

The pandemic has only made us lean on Amazon more. The tech bellwether has managed to always post double-digit annual revenue growth, even through the dot-com bubble popping and now a pair of recessions. In 2020 it likely delivered its strongest top-line increase since 2011. Amazon checks off a lot of boxes for a starting investor. Disney and Target check off the boxes that are left.","['Rick Munarriz', 'Tmfbreakerrick', 'Since', 'Rick Has Been Writing For The Motley Fool', ""Where He'S A Consumer"", 'Tech Stocks Specialist.

Taraji P. Henson opens up about how she told her son his dad had been murdered,"Taraji P. Henson is opening up about how difficult it was to tell her son that his father had been murdered.

In a new preview for Wednesday's episode of Facebook Watch's ""Peace of Mind with Taraji,"" the ""Empire"" star, 50, recalled breaking the news to her son, Marcell Johnson, that his dad, William LaMarr ""Mark"" Johnson, had died.

""My son's father was suddenly taken — murdered — when he was 9, and I didn't know how to tell him that. I couldn't tell him he was murdered, so I told him he died in an accident,"" the Oscar nominee told co-host Tracie Jade Jenkins and their guest, mental health counselor Sierra Hillsman.

Marcell Johnson, who's now 26, later learned the truth about his father's death.

""Later on in life he found out and he came back to me and was like, 'Why didn't you tell me my daddy was murdered?' And so then we had to get therapy,"" said Henson.

The ""Hidden Figures"" star tearfully recounted seeing her ex's murder reported in a newspaper.

""It was in the paper and I didn't know how to tell (my son). He was stabbed to death. It was the worst way you could die,"" she said. ""And I just didn't have the words. I didn't know how to tell a 9-year-old.""

A longtime advocate for mental health, Henson told Sunday TODAY's Willie Geist last month that she launched her Facebook Watch show to spread awareness about mental health issues in the Black community. ""The mental health crisis in the Black community felt like it needed some urgency, something where we can reach more people,"" she said.

She used the platform to open up about her own bout with depression in 2020, which got so bad that she wanted to ""just end it all.""

""I had a dark moment,"" she told psychologist Dr. LaShonda Green on the show last month. ""I was in a dark place. For a couple of days, I couldn't get out of the bed, I didn't care. That's not me.""

""Then I started having thoughts about ending it. It happened two nights in a row,"" she continued.

Henson felt herself withdrawing from others. She also hesitated to share her dark thoughts for fear her friends would think she was ""crazy.""

""So one day I just blurted it out, to my girlfriend,"" she said. ""She called me in the morning and I was like, 'You know, I thought about killing myself last night. Oh, my God, I feel so much better. I'm not gonna do it now.'""

The candid star said she fears what might have happened if she had internalized her thoughts and not confided in a friend.

""For me, I'm no professional, but I felt like, if I don't say it, then it becomes a plan,"" she said. ""And what scared me was that I did it two nights in a row, and the thoughts kept coming.""

Drag Race season 13 preview sees Porkchop Loading Dock vote to eliminate,"RuPaul's Drag Race Close Streaming Options

The lady said go home, but whomst is getting The Porkchop?

EW's exclusive sneak peek at the second episode of RuPaul's Drag Race season 13 (below) sees the dolls — all of whom lost head-to-head lip-syncs on the main stage during last week's premiere — in the Porkchop Loading Dock, awaiting their fate, which Mama Ru reveals in a menacing announcement over the studio loudspeaker: Rosé, Eliott with 2 Ts, Denali, Tamisha Iman, Joey Jay, Utica Queen, and Kahmora Hall must vote for one of their fellow competitors (using All-Stars-style lipsticks) to say goodbye.

Once they've completed the task, the remaining queens will have a chance to return to the competition — an ordeal Iman calls ""overwhelming"" as the cast deliberates.

""We have to vote someone off. This is a competition. This is what we signed up for. Alright, bitches. S--- is about to go down!"" Jay says before approaching the lipstick box and selecting Elliott's tube. ""If we're going off of first impressions, I don't know you, sis! But, where's the look? I don't see a wow factor.""

Soon after, Denali references Jay's entrance look and admits she's ""not a fan of chicken feathers"" before dropping the Phoenix-based queen's lipstick into the container. The only other vote revealed in the clip is that of Hall, who votes against Utica.

In the end, RuPaul confirms that the result is a tie. Gooped, gagged, etc.

Olivia Wilde's latest Instagram post is trolled by Harry Styles fanatics after confirming romance,"Olivia Wilde's latest Instagram post has been trolled by Harry Styles fanatics just days after the pair confirmed their romance at his agent's wedding over the weekend.

The actress, 36, took to Instagram earlier this month with a funny New Year meme of rock band Ramones, but was flooded with criticism over her relationship with the musician, 26, who he is working with on the film she is directing, Don't Worry Darling.

Some of the One Direction star's followers claimed the mother-of-two 'stole' him from them and slammed their decision to advance from colleagues to lovers, while others defended their romance and branded the hate 'embarrassing'.

Screen star Olivia's post read: '2020, 24 hours to go' - a funny spin on Ramones' 1978 hit track I Wanna Be Sedated.

Despite the filmmakers' efforts to inject humour into the start of the year, a few social media users took the opportunity to lash out at her for dating singer Harry.

One cruelly questioned the professionalism of Olivia's psychological horror movie, which sees her new beau step into the leading role of Jack, who hides a dark secret from his wife Alice (Florence Pugh).

He took over Shia LaBeouf’s role as Florence's love interest in September last year, and it is his first screen role since the 2017 movie Dunkirk.

Light-hearted: The filmmaker took to Instagram earlier this month with a funny New Year meme of rock band Ramones

They said: 'dating a Co star and an employee isnt very professional from you ...the movie should be called Harry and olivia'. (sic)

Others agreed: 'So… Harry Styles got the part because he sleeps with the director? LOL.

'And now we know how he got the part in the film... Did you slept with harry and you gave him the part? and you split with your husband bcoz you want to date harry?' (sic)

Another troll ridiculed Harry's past relationships, as well as the New Yorker's nine-year romance with Wilde Jason Sudeikis, with whom she shares son Otis, six, and daughter Daisy, four.

Naysayers: Some of the One Direction star's followers claimed the mother-of-two 'stole' him from them and slammed their decision to advance from colleagues to lovers

They said: 'I know Harry have a thing for older women not a mummy with 2 babies... YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF WHAT YOU'RE DOING... DATING A BOY WHO'S WORKUNG FOR YOU!' (sic)

However, a legion of the songwriter's loyal fanbase urged the naysayers to stop writing negative comments on Olivia's page, especially after Harry recently released the music video to his track Treat People with Kindness (TPWK).

Treat People with Kindness is a slogan the media personality first used to promote love and acceptance during his debut concert tour in 2017.

Fans penned: 'clearly some of you in the comments have forgotten to TREAT PEOPLE WITH KINDNESS!!!! On behalf of the SANE Harry stans, I'm sorry and this is embarrassing.

Support: Others defended the new couple, branded the hate 'embarrassing' and said their remarks weren't reflective of the artist's loyal fanbase

Family first: The former couple have remained committed co-parents to their two children: Otis Alexander, six, and Daisy Josephine, four (pictured)

'where's the treat people with kindness? leave her alone. she has done nothing. i'm so sorry for all the hate oh my god.

'jesus christ please leave her alone.. olivia bby i'm so sorry about these comments ily queen... LEAVE HER ALONE.

Harry and Olivia made their debut as Hollywood's hottest new power at his agent's nuptials in Montecito, California over the weekend.

Their appearance marks the thespian's first public relationship since her split from actor fiancé Jason, 45, in early 2020.

The happy photos came amid claims James Corden helped keep close friend Harry and Olivia's 'romance a secret' after allowing the artist to stay in his home while filming Don't Worry Darling in Palm Springs, California.

A source told Page Six: 'This relationship between Harry and Olivia is very new. Olivia has been directing Harry in the movie in Palm Springs, and there were literally 10 people on the set, because they were strictly adhering to COVID rules.

'Harry had been staying at James Corden's house near Palm Springs during filming, and so they were able to be alone and keep their relationship very secret.

'So everyone was really surprised — and rather delighted — when Harry brought Olivia as his date to the wedding, and introduced her as his girlfriend.'

The source added that Harry doesn't give a 'f**k* about the 10-year age gap and was 'openly holding hands and kissing Olivia'. Olivia, Harry and James' representatives were contacted for comment.","['Rianne Addo', 'Rianne Addo For Mailonline']",https://news.google.com,high
How the Sixers are building offense for Joel Embiid to thrive,"Draped in a cream Under Armour sweatshirt with “The Process” printed in one corner, Joel Embiid slowed his words. A subtle grin crept across his face. He paused — ever so slightly, combing through his vernacular for the proper phrasing. Then, he continued, authoring an eloquent tagline to explain his passing upswing that’s allowing the offense to hum in recent games.

“I’ve rekindled with the love of passing,” said Embiid, who’s guided the Philadelphia 76ers to four consecutive wins and the NBA’s best record at 6-1.

To identify this growth necessitates watching the 2020-21 version of Embiid, who is averaging a career-best 3.7 turnovers per 100 possessions. His assist-to-turnover ratio is only the third-highest of his career and his assists per 100 possessions have only been lower his rookie season. He is not picking up an array of secondary or potential assists, either. The traditional barometers associated with playmaking development do not summarize the degree to which Embiid is catalyzing offense so effectively from the post.

A retooled roster and coaching staff have facilitated his improvement. Josh Richardson and Al Horford, a pair of middling floor-spacers who shrunk the court alongside Embiid, were swapped for Seth Curry and Danny Green, two of the league’s better off-ball shooters, particularly the former. Brett Brown and his offensive approach departed in favor of Doc Rivers and offensive coordinator Dave Joerger. Since Rivers’ arrival, the emphasis offensively has been centered on how to simplify Embiid’s responsibilities and maximize his scoring gravity.

“He’s a great player. All great players are gonna get trapped, whether they’re bigs or guards, and I’ve always thought it’s my job to make sure, when they get trapped, we’re in the right spot,” Rivers said. “We have this attitude: If you trap us, we will score. That’s gotta be our attitude and you can feel our guys believing that.”

During Brown’s tenure as head coach, the offense struggled to provide Embiid with a balance of static and motion-based passing reads. Rivers’ intention is to require both from his All-Star center, but designate certain players as cutters and shooters. Cutters move. Shooters, typically, are stationary, Rivers said. The philosophy is that if Embiid knows who may bolt to the rim and who will remain spotting up, discerning when and how to pass out of double-teams becomes easier.

“It’s all about post spacing. You gotta be in the right spot. When the defense moves, you move to a different spot. What we try to teach and what I try to teach post players is where they’re gonna be, so now the passing is easier,” Rivers said. “When you’re guessing and guys are moving around, it’s difficult. There’s different hands in there. But when you know where everyone’s gonna be, it makes it pretty simple.”

Embiid does not necessarily view his refined post passing as a product of increased floor-spacing or the spots he catches the ball on the court. It’s simply about the successive events after he chooses to relinquish control that are igniting trust in his teammates. The results, whether they’re occurring in practice or games, are instilling newfound confidence in his decision to embrace snappy passing.

That credence seemingly blossomed in games against the Toronto Raptors and Orlando Magic last week. Both teams were prompt and aggressive in sending double-teams from the strong-side. Whereas in prior years Embiid may have methodically surveyed the floor and retreated into the corner, placing himself in a precarious spot that complicates any sort of pass, he executed the simple read to spur ball reversals and open shots.

While Embiid triggers each play, everything is accentuated by off-ball instincts. Curry and Tobias Harris relocate to broaden passing windows. Ben Simmons sets a flare screen for Shake Milton to blockade oncoming defenders. Curry slips to the corner, elongating the distance of Markelle Fultz’s closeout. Harris catches on the move to scoot past his defender. Habits like those, minute details to alter a play’s success rate, represent change for Embiid.

“Last year, at times, doubled, you pass and you miss a couple, a lot of shots, and it gets frustrating. And then, you start thinking, ‘Oh, you gotta do everything by yourself,’ because everybody’s not making shots. This year, I just think I’ve been letting the game come to me,” Embiid said following Monday’s win. “It’s just the shooters, and I just gotta be a willing passer. Games like the last few games or the whole season, every game that I play, they keep doubling, triple-teaming me, trying to take me out of the game and I just gotta keep making the right passes. I might not get a lot of assists, but the whole goal of it is to get someone else open. Invite the double or the triple-team and just get a lot of hockey assists.”

Those hockey assists are critical to understanding Embiid’s maturation as a passer. Rivers said it’s a statistic the team tracks internally and estimated Embiid ranks second behind Simmons this season. If Philadelphia tracked them last year and they were publicly available, it’d be a vibrant indicator of his improvement.

Flanked by heightened shooting and more suitable ancillary personnel to play off of his gravity and creation, Embiid’s usage rate (27.4 percent) and points per 100 possessions (34.1) reside at career lows. Developing into a vastly more willing and impactful passer, he’s twisting opponents into a bind. He’s scoring a career-high 1.111 points per post-up, producing a career-high true shooting of 63.3 percent (6.8 points above league average, also a career-high) and career-high free-throw rate of .628, and yielding a career-best turnover rate of 12 percent.

“If you wanna double, I dare you ’cause we’re gonna knock down those shots,” Embiid said. “If you let me play one on one, it’s either a bucket or a foul.”

“You want them to go help, ‘Go help, I dare you. This is Seth Curry. This is Furkan (Korkmaz). This is Shake. This is Tobias. Be my guest,’ “ Rivers said. “What we’re trying to convince our guys of is it doesn’t matter who scores when you go through the post. It matters that we score, and we have to have that mentality. If you don’t trap Joel, Joel’s going to score on you. We’ve talked about that every day so far. If you do trap Joel, we’re gonna score on you. Every night, you pick it, but we’re scoring either way. That’s gotta be our mindset.”

One of the shooting additions acquired to complement Embiid is Danny Green, a three-time NBA champion who’s accustomed to functioning next to post-up creators like the Sixers superstar. He played with Tim Duncan and LaMarcus Aldridge in San Antonio, LeBron James and Anthony Davis in Los Angeles, and Kawhi Leonard in Toronto (and San Antonio). Such an accomplished history in those settings, winning titles with each franchise and low-block scorer, bestows him wisdom to alleviate pressure for Embiid and spread his teachings to teammates.

Green tells them how and when to cut or move off the ball. He encourages them to stay patient, spaced and ready. Let the offensive focal points dictate action. The ball will find you. Those experiences also forge an open dialogue with Embiid.

“Ask him where he’s comfortable with, what he feels in that area, what does he want me to do,” Green said. “I’ll also tell him, I’m gonna be here for you. I’ll be there. I’m usually gonna move this way or I’ll move that way, so it’ll be an easier pass for you. But it’s just a communication factor of feeling each other out and what’s comfortable for both of us to be successful.”

Only converting 30.3 percent beyond the arc this season, Green is yet to directly deliver on his shooting reputation. But the principles he’s imparting on teammates are evident and he’s shooting 77.8 percent on 2-pointers, seizing opportunities when run off the line. He positions himself well for kick-outs, shrewdly relocates when applicable and is a precise ball mover. His early session decision-making illuminates his understanding of how to thrive while playing in a post-oriented offense, and many of Embiid’s hockey assists run through Green.

The 3-point shooting and interior clip will likely regress to the mean in opposite directions, ensuring Green maintains his offensive contributions, while continuing to shape his contemporaries’ perceptions of their off-ball duties.

Teams are not solely sending double- or triple-teams from the strong-side against Embiid. The Charlotte Hornets and New York Knicks brought help from the weak-side corner or pre-rotated to cut off the strong-side kick-out. That sort of strategy complicates how Embiid capitalizes because he cannot just send it back to whoever fed him an entry pass, which is usually Green, Curry or Harris, three proficient shooters. The defensive alignment invites a skip pass to the corner or wing. Rivers wants Embiid to be prepared for all of these coverages. He said they’re working every day with him to emerge capable of exploiting any gambit.

Embiid’s previous affinity for complex post passing — to a fault, he’s long loved that cross-court skip to the corner shooter — aids him now that teams are reorienting themselves to eliminate the easy stuff. He’s nailing the initial read, and his talent allows him to benefit off of it.

“Now, he’s looking off and throwing that skip pass, which leads to the corner 3,” Rivers said. “I just love that he knows now, ‘If I can throw it to the first guy, something good’s gonna happen. If they take that away, something better is gonna happen on the other side.’

“We’ve got to keep making sure that Joel knows where the answers are. I think that’s very important on our end and when we do that, I think it makes him a more confident passer.”

The team-wide initiative to enhance Embiid’s offense with shooting and a scheme built upon that is logically profitable — and it’s playing out that way to open the year. But the Sixers employ one of the NBA’s least threatening shooters among non-centers in Simmons, who Embiid has shared the court with for 167 of his 192 minutes this season. Shaping an attack where those two occupy the floor together for long and vital stretches is more challenging.

“When Ben doesn’t have the ball, we have to make someone guard him every single time,” Rivers said.

Simmons is timing his cuts better over the last few games. He’s also not frequenting the dunker’s spot at the rate he did with Brown in charge, providing Embiid more real estate on the interior. The advantages of versatile off-ball deployment are manifesting. As a cutter, he’s occupying multiple defenders if he crashes inside at the correct moment. As an off-ball screener, he’s springing shooters open.

“Even if I cut, and I’m not the one open, the weak-side may be open,” Simmons said. “Everything we’re doing on the floor has a purpose.”

That purpose is augmented by Embiid’s playmaking development, which significantly broadens his partner’s off-ball utility. If Embiid is not sparking these pass-happy sequences, Simmons’ contributions to occupy defenders precipitously decline in value. Without a chance for the ball to find a shooter, the cutting and screening mean little. They’d just occur for the sake of it.

Rivers affords Simmons the freedom to let instinct be his compass. His flashes over the past three games convey a sense of shifting gears, with the fourth-year All-Star adapting to a new system, Embiid’s “rekindled” passing comfort and the role he’s asked to assume.

“Just making the right reads, depending on where the help comes from or the double comes from, I need to either get myself or my teammates open,” Simmons said. “Joel’s making the right reads and he’s playing with a little urgency once he sees that double, so guys are able to get their shots off, off that weak-side.

“That’s a good thing about Doc, is he allows me to make the right reads. He’s gonna tell me if he thinks there’s a certain spot I should get to. If I don’t do something, whether it’s a cut or a slash, or just spacing-wise.”

Embiid approaches the trajectory of this distinct star dynamic with cautious optimism. He said he tells Simmons he’s doing a great job playing off of him in the post, but also that he must sustain this progress. That sentiment — good, with ample space for more — was a repeated theme as he discussed the manner in which Simmons can amplify him off the ball. Simmons is unlike the other three starters or the bench players who surround Embiid. He will not be netting 3s after a string of passes. His avenues for impact present hurdles and opportunities.

“He’s cutting, taking two men with him. And then, it just makes it also easier for all the shooters to get wide open and knock down shots. We gotta keep on working it and working on it. We gotta keep on trying to get better and we’ve been getting better,” Embiid said. “A couple times, when he’s in the dunker’s (spot) and he ducks in, he needs to either duck in or, I don’t know, post up on the other side if they end up not recovering. Or, also, setting a flare screen for the man going to the corner, which we’ve done a couple times this season and it’s been working. That’s where I think he’s gotta get better but he’s been doing a fantastic job just playing off of it.”

The focus, through Embiid’s lens, must not be and is not on how Simmons can assist him. It is about how Simmons’ off-ball activity and decision-making influences the entire unit on the floor. The attention Embiid commands in the post and how he proceeds from that may be a possession’s firestarter, but there is a collective group into which Simmons is blending.

Philadelphia’s first few games brought about a handful of clunky offensive plays involving these two. The last few games, while headlined by congruity, have still featured spells of incongruity. Those instances are bound to occur when two All-Stars maximized on the interior lead a team in a space-driven league.

A six-game slate against the Knicks, Hornets, Magic, Raptors and Washington Wizards does not gauge how this pairing translates to high-leverage situations or how well the Sixers can manufacture offense with Embiid as the centerpiece in those settings.

Embiid will face more varying coverages. Stingier tests await. How he adjusts is paramount, especially against opponents who may be capable of containing him in single coverage. Reduced early season turnover totals from him are a three-year tradition now. Carrying this over an entire season and into the playoffs is the axis on which Philadelphia’s success rests.

“I’ve kinda figured out passing out of the post and why I’ve been doing such a good job this season is, just get rid of it,” Embiid said. “Then, hoping that the next guy, if he doesn’t have the shot, keeps moving the ball because, at the end of the day, there’s going to be a two-on-one, either in the corner (or) in the slot.”

If Embiid continues swiftly organizing those two-on-one scenarios and the Sixers continue to punish them, that subtle grin of his won’t fade away any time soon.",['Jan'],https://news.google.com,high
NFL Rumors: Patriots’ Josh McDaniels Won’t Follow Nick Caserio To Texans,"Nick Caserio’s first big task as the Houston Texans’ general manager will be hiring a new head coach.

That coach will not be Josh McDaniels.

The longtime New England Patriots offensive coordinator “isn’t a candidate to become the Texans’ new head coach,” according to a report from John McClain of the Houston Chronicle.

McDaniels, who played college football with Caserio at John Carroll University, said last month he “absolutely” wants to be a head coach again, but his name has not been linked to any of the current head-coaching vacancies.

Along with the Texans, the Detroit Lions, Atlanta Falcons, New York Jets, Los Angeles Chargers and Jacksonville Jaguars all are in the market for new head coaches.",['Zack Cox'],https://news.google.com,high
Los Angeles Rams To Wear New Uniform Combination In Playoffs,"Upon unveiling their new logos and uniforms this offseason, the Los Angeles Rams said they wouldn’t mix and match their bone-colored jersey or pants with pieces from their home uniform.

It should come as no surprise, then, that Los Angeles will break out another new combination when it travels to Seattle for its Wild Card playoff game on Saturday. This time, though, the Rams will wear blue pants along with their bone-colored jersey.

PFF Ranks the Colts as the NFL’s 2nd ‘Most Complete’ 2020 Playoff Team,"According to Pro Football Focus (subscription), the Indianapolis Colts are the second ‘most complete team’ in the NFL’s entire 2020 playoff field—behind only the New Orleans Saints:

NO. 2: INDIANAPOLIS COLTS Offense PFF’s No. 1 ranked preseason offensive line didn’t quite dominate from start to finish, but they ultimately boasted the third-best unit in both PFF team run-blocking grade and pressure rate. Throw in the reality that old man Philip Rivers is usually able to set this offense up for success in terms of pre-snap process, and you have an offense capable of moving the ball against just about anybody. Rookie Jonathan Taylor has taken the league by storm over the final month of the season, but this success isn’t something that was consistent throughout the entire season. Overall, Taylor forced just nine missed tackles on rush attempts in Weeks 1-10; he racked up 34 broken tackles on carries in Weeks 11-17. A fairly soft season-ending schedule certainly helped matters; just realize the January-version of Taylor looks far different from what we saw during the first two and a half months of the season. Defense The Colts finished fourth in missed tackle rate, yards allowed after the catch per reception and yards allowed after contact per carry. Ball carriers seldom get more than expected against this defense, thanks in large part to regularly elite efforts from stud LB Darius Leonard (PFF’s No. 8 highest-graded linebacker) and prized offseason addition DT DeForest Buckner (No. 3 interior defender) alike. The one key ingredient missing from this defense is the presence of a truly elite pass rusher. Overall, the Colts rank just 21st in pressure rate. Only the Seahawks (No. 25), Packers (No. 27) and Titans (No. 29) had a harder time consistently getting to opposing QBs among all 14 playoff teams.

Now, rest assured, this doesn’t mean the Colts are the second best team in the playoffs, but it at least helps support what we already know. That is, when the Colts are going well and right, they’re a well-balanced team offensively, who are also backed by a strong defense.

The lingering key concerns are can the Colts improve their 3rd quarter scoring and will their sometimes dominant defense put it together for two halves—instead of just one, with a lack of pass rush remaining a critical concern.

The red hot Buffalo Bills, who rank #11 here, present a very tough matchup and should still be considered a heavy favorite at home against the Colts. That being said, the Colts are a well-rounded team, who will present a difficult underdog for anyone to actually knock out.

Specifically, if the Colts can get rookie rushing star Jonathan Taylor and the ground game really going, Philip Rivers taking calculated shots through the air, and their defense playing up to its full potential again—featuring a stout run defense, it’s a recipe for success in cold, January weather football.

If nothing else, Horseshoe fans absolutely cannot wait until Saturday afternoon for this ‘complete’ Colts squad to truly show what it’s got—win or lose.","['Luke Schultheis', 'Jan']",https://news.google.com,high
21 Burning questions for Patriots 2021 offseason,"17. Will the coaching staff and front office be pillaged?

With Nick Caserio already reportedly heading to Houston to be their next GM, the changes to the front office and coaching staff have already begun. No other departure outside of Belichick himself or Josh McDaniels could have as much of an impact as Caserio's departure. Dave Ziegler could be a candidate to replace Caserio, but the Broncos are seeking permission to interview him for their GM spot as well. Either could also poach some of the coaches from the staff as well. What's clear is that Bill Belichick not only has to re-build much of his roster, but significant parts of his staff as well.

18. Build to beat the AFC East?

The Bills are coming off one of the best seasons in the NFL and don't appear to be headed anywhere when it comes to AFC East dominance. The Dolphins also surpassed the Patriots in the standings and have a young quarterback they believe in, while the Jets are poised to perhaps get their quarterback of the future with the second-overall pick. Dealing with these AFC East teams must be a part of the team-building approach, just as those teams did for almost two decades trying to stop Tom Brady. But they can't lose sight of the direction teams like the Chiefs, Ravens and Titans are taking the conference. Dealing with those diverse attacks must be a consideration as well.

19. What will this offseason look like?

After making it through a COVID year and vaccines on the horizon, 2021 doesn't look quite as daunting as 2020 was, but the challenges of playing sports in a pandemic will carry over into the offseason. Will it hamper draft scouting? Free agency? The start of offseason training activities? Will minicamps happen? It's a long list of questions that have yet to be answered, leaving much of the league in suspended animation until the NFL prescribes a plan going forward.

20. Will there be a preseason?

That uncertainty of the offseason will feed into training camp and the preseason. While zero preseason games seems unlikely, a reduction to two or three seems inevitable. But that's assuming the NFL is even at a point by August where they're ready to pull off those preseason games. A reduced preseason slate will still be better than not playing any preseason games at all.

21. Will there be a 17th game?

Directly tied to the preseason games will be the addition of a 17th game, which seems extremely likely at this point. Based on the projected schedule rotation, the Patriots would face the Dallas Cowboys, by virtue of both team's third-place divisional finish. A 17th game would impact the season schedule in multiple ways and will be a central piece to this offseason and the negotiations that take place over how everything comes together.",['Mike Dussault'],https://news.google.com,high
6 Jets head-coaching candidates who could turn Sam Darnold’s career around,"Adam Gase is gone, but Sam Darnold’s fate hasn’t been decided yet.

Darnold said he wants to be a Jet for life, but he wasn’t sure if he played his last game following a bad Week 17 loss to the Patriots. That decision will ultimately come down to Joe Douglas and whichever head coach he picks to replace Gase. He’ll have to choose between Darnold – who’s produced three poor seasons after being drafted third overall in 2018 – or a top prospect like Justin Fields or Zach Wilson with the second overall pick.

If the Jets keep Darnold, though, it will be because they found a coach who believes he can fix his flaws. Here are six potential candidates whose resumes suggest that they could.

Chiefs OC Eric Bieniemy

(Denny Medley-USA TODAY Sports)

Bieniemy played a key role in Patrick Mahomes’s development over the past few seasons in Kansas City and definitely learned how to tailor an offense to the strength of his quarterback.

It doesn’t hurt that he’s learned from one of the best head coaches of all time in Andy Reid. Darnold is no Mahomes, but Bieniemy has the tools to help him elevate his game.

Bills OC Brian Daboll

Rich Barnes-USA TODAY Sports

Daboll spent the past three seasons rewiring Josh Allen into an MVP-caliber quarterback. Allen’s stats improved dramatically over the past three years, culminating in a top-five finish in passing yards and passing touchdowns.

Perhaps Darnold isn’t far off from an Allen-like resurgence; he just needs a coach who understands how to cultivate the switch from mediocre to Pro Bowl.

Panthers OC Joe Brady

(Jacob Kupferman-Getty Images)

Brady is one of the best young offensive minds in the league after making the jump from LSU to the Panthers this year. He helped Joe Burrow blossom into the No. 1 overall pick in 2020 and helped Teddy Bridgewater throw for almost 4,000 yards and 15 touchdowns.

He may not be ready for a head coaching job just yet at age 31, but he’s proven he’s a good offensive-minded coach.

Saints OC Pete Carmichael

(Derick E. Hingle-USA TODAY Sports)

Carmichael has coached Drew Brees in some capacity since 2002 with the Chargers and Saints. He helped him become a Hall of Fame and record-breaking quarterback.

Carmichael’s Saints offenses have been among the best in the NFL since 2009, too. Carmichael’s his work with Bridgewater, Jameis Winston and Taysom Hill when Brees was injured shows he’s able to coach the best out of his players, no matter their age or skill level.

Packers OC Nathaniel Hackett

(Joshua Clark-USA TODAY NETWORK-Wis)

Hackett coached Aaron Rodgers the past two seasons and helped him turn in a career year. He could do the same for Darnold, too, especially given Hackett’s success in worse situations like Jacksonville and Buffalo.

Hackett’s Jaguars offense finished fifth in points and sixth in yards in 2017 with Blake Bortles under center. Hackett’s father, Paul, was a prolific college and NFL coach who was also the Jets offensive coordinator from 2001-2004.

The Titans’ offense and quarterback Ryan Tannehill improved dramatically with Smith running the show. In terms of scoring and yards, the Tennesse offense finished inside the top-five in 2020 and the top-12 in 2019. Tannehill, meanwhile, became one of the most efficient quarterbacks in the league and also showed he could run, totaling 11 rushing touchdowns over the last two years.

Smith would bring a level of competency and creativity as a play-caller and talent developer that Darnold hasn’t seen since he joined the league.","['Tyler Greenawalt', 'Spencer Aber', 'Sam Neumann', 'Gary Phillips', 'Tyler Calvaruso', 'Thomas Neumann']",https://news.google.com,high
"Why Dave Gettleman is staying, more takeaways from Giants’ co-owner John Mara","New York Giants co-owner John Mara formally announced on Wednesday that Dave Gettleman is staying on for a fourth season as general manager. Mara said simply that Gettleman “is coming back.”

The Giants have gone 15-33 in Gettleman’s three seasons as general manager, with double-digit losses in each season.

Mara said that he wanted to see progress this season and did, despite the team going 6-10 in Joe Judge’s rookie season as an NFL head coach.

“There’s a different feeling in the building than there has been in a number of years,” Mara said.

Mara said he liked what he saw from the working relationship between his soon-to-be-70-year-old general manager and his just-turned-39 head coach. Mara said the two “worked very well together.”

“I like the combination we have right now and I didn’t see any reason to break that up,” Mara said. “We have the foundation for something that can be very successful going forward.”

Mara said while the Giants did not win enough games, they made enough progress “to warrant staying the course.”

Via the Big Blue View Twitter account, here are more takeaways from Mara’s season-ending Zoom call.

"LSU hires Peetz as OC, Mangas joins on-field staff","LSU head coach Ed Orgeron said the top candidates in the search for two offensive coaches were both in Baton Rouge on Tuesday for interviews, and Orgeron's plans were to lock the pair up with a sooner-than-later approach.

Less than 24 hours after the interviews ended, Orgeron has found his hires.

LSU has hired Carolina Panthers quarterbacks coach Jake Peetz to be the program's new offensive coordinator, sources confirmed with the Geaux247 staff. Peetz will replace former LSU offensive coordinator Steve Ensminger, who retired in December after 10 seasons on staff in Baton Rouge.

Peetz, who worked in 2020 under former LSU passing game coordinator Joe Brady, was in Baton Rouge on Tuesday for a formal interview, which included an interview with another Panthers coach. Peetz was joined on the interview by former LSU analyst and current Panthers offensive assistant DJ Mangas, who worked alongside Brady and Ensminger during LSU's 2019 National Championship season.

Now, Mangas will return to Baton Rouge as an on-field coach as the program's Passing Game Coordinator, sources confirmed with the Geaux247 staff. Mangas will take over the same role Brady - his longtime friend and coaching partner - occupied in Baton Rouge. LSU's passing game coordinator in 2020 was longtime NFL coach Scott Linehan, who spent just one season with the team.

LSU is set to announce both hires on Wednesday, sources confirmed with the Geaux247 staff.

During an appearance on 104.5ESPN's Off the Bench earlier this week, Orgeron said the decision to pursue Peetz and Mangas came as a result of his desire to move forward with an offense similar to the 2019 team, which went 15-0 under Orgeron.

That resulted in LSU reaching out to Brady, who recommended both Peetz and Mangas as good fits to bring the offensive philosophy back to Baton Rouge.

“I have a lot of respect for Joe,"" Orgeron said. ""We asked Joe who could run the offense, and he recommended two guys who are here today. I believe in Joe and what he’s done, and believe in Coach Ensminger. I thought those two guys worked great together two years ago. This year we lost a little bit of it, and it was because of the expertise of Joe. I want to get back to that offense.”

LSU still has three more open spots with the on-field staff. The Tigers are searching for a new defensive coordinator to replace Bo Pelini, who spent just one season with the Tigers. LSU is also looking to replace Bill Johnson as defensive line coach following his retirement, as well as a potential safeties coach to fill the void left by Bill Busch.

LSU now has all five offensive coaches in place with Peetz as offensive coordinator, Mangas as passing game coordinator, James Cregg as offensive line coach, Kevin Faulk as running backs coach and Mickey Joseph as wide receivers coach.

On defense, the Tigers have longtime defensive backs coach Corey Raymond still in place as cornerbacks coach and recruiting coordinator, though three more hires are expected to join him on that side of the ball.

LSU is scheduled to interview Cincinnati Bearcats defensive coordinator Marcus Freeman on Thursday in Baton Rouge, sources tell the Geaux247 staff.

LSU also returns special teams coordinator Greg McMahon for the 2021 season.

Golden Nuggets: 49ers GM John Lynch named a HOF finalist; Patrick Willis snubbed,"I’d love to know what everyone would like to talk about this month. Pending free agents? Segue into draft talk? We’ll probably begin to review the roster, but I’d love to hear any suggestions. This time a year ago, we were pretending that the Vikings were going to challenge the 49ers in the Divisional round of the playoffs.

HOME OPPONENTS: Atlanta Falcons, Houston Texans, Green Bay Packers, Minnesota Vikings, Indianapolis Colts, Arizona Cardinals, Los Angeles Rams, Seattle Seahawks.

ROAD OPPONENTS: Detroit Lions, Philadelphia Eagles, Jacksonville Jaguars, Chicago Bears, Tennessee Titans, Arizona Cardinals, Los Angeles Rams, Seattle Seahwaks.

Four of the above teams finished last in their respective divisions in 2020 — the Falcons, the Lions, the Eagles and the Jaguars. You’d figure a healthy 49ers team should be able to beat at least three of those teams.

The 49ers also will face the Bears in Chicago. The Bears head coach, Matt Nagy, is terrible and probably will get fired after 2021. And we don’t know who their quarterback will be next season. So the 49ers could win this game, too.

“Gauge trade interest for oft-injured Jimmy Garoppolo, but ultimately consider reasons to keep him too,” wrote Jeremy Fowler. “The 49ers are 24-10 with Garoppolo and 7-25 without him since 2017. Keeping him doesn’t preclude San Francisco from drafting a quarterback in the first round and applying pressure on the veteran.”

“It would be helpful to find out what’s causing all these injuries to virtually every position and use that information to prevent them in 2021,” adds Fowler. “Keep either (Jason) Verrett or Richard Sherman at corner, but not both; can’t afford both, because re-signing linebacker Fred Warner (a 2022 free agent) and left tackle Williams are paramount.”

“The 49ers struck again. Aiyuk is in the same mold as the George Kittles’ and the Deebo Samuels’ added to San Francisco’s roster in recent years. He’s a dynamic player with the ball in his hands and dangerous after the catch.

“His 80.8 receiving grade on the season trailed only (Minnesota Vikings receiver Justin) Jefferson among rookies, and he got to that mark as the top option in the passing game for a 49ers team that was hammered with injuries for much of the season. Aiyuk’s relatively modest totals of 60 receptions for 748 yards and five receiving touchdowns were all top marks for San Francisco this season.

“A more stable quarterback situation in 2021 and a healthier 49ers offense should only help Aiyuk moving forward.”

“I can’t tell you with great (certainty) that, yeah, he’s going to be ready,” Lynch said via the San Francisco Chronicle. “We’re working hard – and he is working hard – to try to get there.”

Ford had back issues prior to arriving in San Francisco. He played in just three games of the 2011 college season because of a back issue that required surgery, and he missed 10 games for the Chiefs in 2017 for another back surgery.

The 49ers originally described Ford’s injury as a neck issue, but it’s since been reclassified as a back injury.

“When you’re dealing with a part of your body – the back – sometimes these things take more time,” Lynch said via the Chronicle. “I think Dee tries to stay encouraged. But I think it’s been a struggle for him. And we try to stay encouraged, as well.”

Lynch, currently the 49ers’ general manager, was announced Tuesday among the final 15 of modern-era finalists for the Hall of Fame Class of 2021.

However, two prominent former 49ers players, defensive lineman Bryant Young and linebacker Patrick Willis, did not advance past the semifinalist round.

Young was a finalist last year, but he did not make it beyond the final 25 this year. Willis, a Pro Bowl player in each of his first seven seasons, has not been a finalist in his two years of Hall of Fame eligibility.

The Hall of Fame selection committee is scheduled to meet virtually on Jan. 19 to select the next class of Hall of Famers. Up to five modern-era players, who must receive a minimum of 80 percent of the votes, will be elected.","['Kyle Posey', 'Jan']",https://news.google.com,high
Study finds we’re already committed to more global warming—sort of,"Someday, humans will get it together and dramatically reduce greenhouse gas emissions. But—not to fact check your daydreams too strictly here—how exactly will global temperatures respond to that day? This is a question climate science has long worked to answer, although devils in the details have led to some confusion.

A new study led by Nanjing University’s Chen Zhou tracks down another devil and puts it on display. Research has increasingly shown that it’s not just the planet’s average surface temperature that matters for tracking warming, but the spatial pattern of those temperatures. That can be important for calculating things like the climate’s sensitivity to greenhouse gases, but it hasn’t been accounted for in some methods of estimating how emissions cuts affect warming.

Seeing a pattern

This “pattern effect” of warming in different areas of the globe influences the way the planet sheds heat back to space. For example, if warming is a little stronger in the western equatorial Pacific Ocean—which it has been—that region is better at producing sunlight-reflecting cloud cover and releasing heat upward. If you assume the warming is occurring evenly around the world, you will miss that slightly offsetting behavior.

Building on previous work, the researchers calculated the influence of the pattern effect on today’s world by comparing historical observations to climate model simulations of a pre-Industrial-Revolution climate. They then tested the pattern effect numbers using satellite measurements of Earth’s overall energy balance for the last few decades. With no pattern effect, the estimated accumulation of energy in Earth’s climate runs a little higher than the satellite measurements. But mixing in their pattern effect numbers results in predictions that match the measurements nicely, including year-to-year wiggles.

What does that mean for a low-emissions future? One way to calculate this has been to use the observed human-caused strengthening of the greenhouse effect and past temperature change. Based on this calculation of the Earth’s climate sensitivity, you could then ask how much warming should occur once greenhouse gases stop increasing. Because the climate (primarily the oceans) cannot instantaneously equilibrate to a stronger greenhouse effect, temperatures take a while to fully catch up.

Advertisement

But where will it be once it does catch up? If the pattern effect has been dampening Earth’s past response, there could be more warming in the pipeline—and a warmer final outcome.

Fear of commitment

Calculations of the warming that we’re already committed to also depend critically on assumptions about what our future emissions will look like—a major source of confusion. The scenario used in this paper is one where we reduce emissions enough to simply maintain current greenhouse gas concentrations. They aren’t going up anymore, but they aren’t going down, either. In this simple scenario, the climate system gets the chance to catch up and reach a new equilibrium. However, this is not a zero emissions scenario, where we halt all emissions and greenhouse gas concentrations slowly begin to decline as the Earth soaks them up.

With that in mind, the results show that accounting for the pattern effect should increase committed warming. For concentrations stabilizing at 2020 levels, if we wait centuries for temperatures to equilibrate, total warming since pre-Industrial times grows from about 1.3°C to 2.3°C. (We have so far experienced about 1.1°C warming.)

An alternate version of this scenario allows short-lived gases and particulate matter to fade out; here, the ultimate warming grows from 1.6°C to 2.8°C. Restricting this very long-term view to just the year 2100, warming grows from 1.3°C to 1.8°C when accounting for the pattern effect.

The exact numbers aren’t really the point here—the researchers note that using a different dataset for past ocean temperatures causes the differences to shrink. It's the general finding—the existence of the pattern effect implies more committed warming—that's potentially important. It could mean that if you really want to permanently limit warming to a certain goal, like 1.5°C or 2°C, you need to err on the side of even lower emissions (or plan on actively removing more CO 2 later on).

But this shouldn’t trigger a fear that a lot more global warming is suddenly inevitable. A constant concentration future is different from a zero emissions future, and the final temperatures don't arrive until after some pretty long time horizons. The study’s real contribution is addressing a shortcoming in some methods of calculating our committed warming. And we first have to show a commitment to halting warming if we want any of these scenarios—or better ones—to become futures we can choose between.

CDC says severe allergic reactions to the Covid vaccine run 10 times reactions to the flu shot but they're still rare,"A pharmacist dilutes the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine while preparing it to administer to staff and residents at the Goodwin House Bailey's Crossroads, a senior living community in Falls Church, Virginia, on December 30, 2020.

The Covid-19 vaccine appears to cause severe allergic reactions at a significantly higher rate than other vaccines among the first wave of Americans to receive the life-saving immunizations, though the reactions are still rare, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Wednesday.

The CDC said there were 21 cases of anaphylaxis — a severe and life-threatening allergic reaction that occurs rarely after vaccination — out of the nearly 1.9 million people who received their first shot of Pfizer's Covid-19 vaccine in mid- to late December, according to a study published in the CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report on Wednesday.

That would mean roughly 11 people out of every million vaccinated would likely experience anaphylaxis, according to CDC data — roughly 10 times higher than the rate for the flu vaccine.

Dr. Nancy Messonnier, the director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, told reporters on a conference call the inoculations were safe for public use and the severe allergic reactions, though higher, were still considered rare.

""The anaphylaxis rate for Covid-19 vaccines may seem high compared to flu vaccines, but I want to reassure you that this is still a rare outcome,"" Messonnier said on the call before the study was released. She added that the data applies to both Pfizer's and Moderna's vaccines, which use similar mRNA technology.

Representatives from Pfizer and Moderna were not immediately available to respond to CNBC's request for comment.

Of the 21 people who experienced the severe allergic reactions, 17 of them had a documented history of allergies or allergic reactions. Seven of those people had a history of anaphylaxis, the study found.

Most people experienced symptoms within 15 minutes after they were given the shot, although anaphylaxis can occur hours after someone is vaccinated, the CDC said. Among the 20 people with follow-up information available, all had recovered or been discharged home, the study found.

""Of course, we all would hope that any vaccine would have zero adverse events, but even at 11 cases per million doses administered, it's a very safe vaccine,"" Messonnier said. She added that there are ""tremendous efforts"" underway to try to determine exactly what is causing the severe allergic reactions.

The coronavirus is killing an average of 2,670 people in the U.S. every day, according to a CNBC analysis of data compiled by Johns Hopkins University, making the vaccine a ""good value proposition,"" Messonnier said.

According to interim guidance from the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, last updated in December, everyone should be observed for 15 minutes following their vaccination to ensure they don't develop symptoms. People with a history of anaphylaxis should be observed for 30 minutes, the committee advised.

The committee also suggested that people who develop anaphylaxis following their first dose shouldn't be given the second dose. Both drugs require two shots spaced weeks apart for full effectiveness. The CDC's study said that every vaccination site should have supplies such as epinephrine ready to treat patients who might develop the severe reactions.

""Fortunately, we know how to treat anaphylaxis, and we've put provisions in place to ensure that at immunization sites, the folks administering the vaccine are ready to treat anaphylaxis,"" Messonnier said.",['Noah Higgins-Dunn'],https://news.google.com,high
Oregon officials didn’t know 42 coronavirus vaccine doses wasted,"Two Portland hospital systems threw out more than three dozen coronavirus vaccine doses even as Oregon’s top health official said his agency knew of no wasted vaccines.

Oregon Health & Science University lost 15 Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine doses after one vial broke and two were mixed improperly, a hospital spokeswoman said. Legacy Health lost 27 doses when it couldn’t find health care workers to take surplus vaccine in the short time before it expires, a Legacy spokesman said.

And yet, the director of the Oregon Health Authority appeared unaware that any doses had been lost in Oregon.

“We have not received any reports of spoilage from sites that are administering the vaccine, and that is something that we keep track of,” Director Patrick Allen said at a news conference Tuesday. “Vaccines are being handled and administered in a proper and timely way.”

The agency said it learned of the wasted doses from The Oregonian/OregonLive and then confirmed them with OHSU and Legacy, despite Legacy saying it had previously reported the information to the state as required.

“We will follow up and make sure this wastage is properly documented,” health authority spokesman Jonathan Modie said in an email.

It’s unclear if other doses in Oregon have been wasted.

The wasted doses reflect just 0.07% of the 55,000 vaccines administered in Oregon so far. And the lost doses have been more than made up for by the unexpected extra doses health care workers have found in overfilled Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine vials.

But the disconnect between hospitals’ reported data and health officials’ statements points to yet more evidence of growing pains as the state faces criticism for its slow vaccination pace and outlines plans to soon vaccinate 12,000 people a day.

The Oregon Health Authority said it is to be expected that some vaccine will spoil in the process of such a massive vaccination project. Nothing yet points to vaccines being wasted due to negligence, the agency said.

“We believe that our health system partners are managing their vaccine responsibly and doing everything that they can to minimize waste,” Modie said. “We have seen no evidence that vaccine is being handled in anything less than a responsible manner.”

Legacy lost doses because Pfizer-BioNTech’s vaccine sometimes has an extra one or two doses per vial, spokesman Brian Terrett said. That meant that Legacy workers would get through the list of people scheduled to get a shot before the vials they had unpacked ran out.

But because the doses have an expiration date measured in hours, not days, doses are lost if someone can’t be found to take a vaccine. Finding such a person can be a challenge, Terrett said, because people need to be able to take time off if they experience side effects.

“Having more doses than expected has impacted our ability to schedule staff for their vaccine effectively,” Terrett said.

The hospital system has reported its lost doses to a statewide vaccine tracking system, Terrett said.

OHSU pharmacists lost 15 doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, said spokeswoman Tamara Hargens-Bradley. One vial containing five doses broke, Hargens-Bradley said, and another two vials containing a combined 10 doses were mixed incorrectly.

Hargens-Bradley did not say whether the hospital had reported the lost doses to the state.

It’s possible that OHSU and Legacy reported the wasted doses to a statewide vaccine tracking system, as required, but that the health authority wasn’t aware of it.

“We’ll check (the state’s vaccine tracking system) and follow up as needed with these providers, and with any providers that have reported such losses,” Modie said.

Bleak start to new year for Britain as it enters third lockdown,"* One in 50 people infected, new daily cases pass 60,000

* Hospitals under strain, risk being overwhelmed

* All schools, non-essential shops, hospitality closed

* Measures to last at least seven weeks, likely longer

* Queen Elizabeth's summer garden parties cancelled (Adds PM Johnson, data on virus spread)

By Estelle Shirbon and Natalie Thomas

LONDON, Jan 5 (Reuters) - Britain began its third COVID-19 lockdown on Tuesday with the government calling for one last major national effort to defeat the spread of a virus that has infected an estimated one in 50 citizens before mass vaccinations turn the tide.

Finance minister Rishi Sunak announced a new package of business grants worth 4.6 billion pounds ($6.2 billion) to help keep people in jobs and firms afloat until measures are relaxed gradually, at the earliest from mid-February but likely later.

Britain has been among the countries worst-hit by COVID-19, with the second highest death toll in Europe and an economy that suffered the sharpest contraction of any in the Group of Seven during the first wave of infections last spring.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the latest data showed 2% of the population were currently infected - more than a million people in England.

""When everybody looks at the position, people understand overwhelmingly that we have no choice,"" he told a news conference.

More than 1.3 million people in Britain have already received their first dose of a COVID-19 vaccination, but this is not enough to have an impact on transmission yet.

Johnson announced the new lockdown late on Monday, saying the highly contagious new coronavirus variant first identified in Britain was spreading so fast the National Health Service risked being overwhelmed within 21 days.

In England alone, some 27,000 people are in hospital with COVID, 40% more than during the first peak in April, with infection numbers expected to rise further after increased socialising during the Christmas period.

Since the start of the pandemic, more than 75,000 people have died in the United Kingdom within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus, according to official figures. The number of daily new infections passed 60,000 for the first time on Tuesday.

A Savanta-ComRes poll taken just after Johnson's address suggested four in five adults in England supported the lockdown.

""I definitely think it was the right decision to make,"" said Londoner Kaitlin Colucci, 28. ""I just hope that everyone doesn't struggle too much with having to be indoors again.""

Downing Street said Johnson had cancelled a visit to India later this month to focus on the response to the virus, and Buckingham Palace called off its traditional summer garden parties this year.

VACCINATIONS ARE KEY

Under the new rules in England, schools are closed to most pupils, people should work from home if possible, and all hospitality and non-essential shops are closed. Semi-autonomous executives in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have imposed similar measures.

As infection rates soar across Europe, other countries are also clamping down on public life. Germany is set to extend its strict lockdown until the end of the month, and Italy will keep nationwide restrictions in place this weekend while relaxing curbs on weekdays.

Sunak's latest package of grants adds to the eye-watering 280 billion pounds in UK government support already announced for this financial year to stave off total economic collapse.

The new lockdown is likely to cause the economy to shrink again, though not as much as during the first lockdown last spring. JP Morgan economist Allan Monks said he expected the economy to shrink by 2.5% in the first quarter of 2021 -- compared with almost 20% in the second quarter of 2020.

To end the cycle of lockdowns, the government is pinning its hopes on vaccines. It aims to vaccinate all elderly care home residents and their carers, everyone over the age of 70, all frontline health and social care workers, and everyone who is clinically extremely vulnerable by mid-February.

But senior minister Michael Gove urged caution in terms of when that might translate into an easing of restrictions.

""We'll be able to review the progress that we've made on the 15th of February ... and we hope that we'll be able to progressively lift restrictions after that, but what I can't do is predict, nobody can predict with accuracy what we will be able to relax and when,"" he said on Sky News.

Can you move 11 minutes a day? You'll live longer if you do,"(CNN) There is no denying that 2020 has hampered activity levels. Between the Zoom meetings, Netflix binges and virtual cocktail hours, increased sitting is a pandemic-driven reality for many. And studies abound citing the myriad health risks of prolonged sitting. But there is good news! Despite all that sedentary time, with as little as 11 minutes of movement a day, you can increase your life span, a recent study has found.

You might be wondering about the hour-per-day measurement that you've been hearing about for years. It's true; past studies, including a popular study from 2016, had originally put the daily exercise target at 60 to 75 minutes for mortality benefits. However, that study was based on self-reported data, which this latest study, published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine, found to be flawed due to people misremembering their actual activity levels.

Taking a more objective approach, scientists at the Norwegian School of Sports Medicine based their research on the use of activity monitors to track exercise versus sedentary time. The results showed that participants who exercised 35 minutes per day saw the biggest statistical difference on life span. Yet just 11 minutes of moderate exercise — equivalent to a brisk walk — still had a noticeable positive impact. What's more, both time frames were positively impactful, regardless of the amount of sitting.

Most anyone can move 11 minutes a day

While 35 minutes of exercise daily is better for your health, a lower barrier to entry makes it easier to get even the most inactive among us moving — and still increasing your life span.

So, how do you do it?

The simplest way is with a walk outside or on the treadmill at your local gym. Walking is one of the best exercises. With winter weather keeping people inside and Covid regulations limiting access to public gyms, though, more creative, accessible means may be necessary to effectively get in your 11 minutes at home. Below are a few ways to consider.

Important note: If you experience pain while performing any of the exercises, stop immediately. Check with your doctor before beginning any new exercise program.

Jogging in place elevates your heart rate -- an ideal way to burn calories during the winter months.

Do 4 sets of a 3-minute body-weight exercise sequence

Four rounds of three minutes add up to 12 minutes, but it's OK — you can handle the bonus minute. Depending on the exercises you use, you may go at a slightly different pace during each round, making it about 11 minutes.

For proper push-up form, make sure your upper and lower body are straight to establish the plank position.

When selecting your exercises, try to pick a sequence of movements that will equate to a full-body workout of moderate effort. For instance, avoid doing only upper-body movements unless you plan to do lower-body movements the next day.

Push-ups build upper body strength.

Ideally, do a combo, like the example below, determining the number of repetitions for each exercise based on your fitness level and maintaining a three-minute sequence for the time frame.

Sample three-minute exercise sequence:

10 to 25 push-ups

25 to 40 body-weight squats

One minute of jogging in place

Practice a yoga flow

Yoga can be a great way to get your body moving while also relieving stress and fostering your mind-body connection. If you've been practicing yoga for a while, you should be able to unroll your mat, set a timer for 11 minutes and go through some sun salutations or any number of combinations of your favorite yoga poses.

If you're newer to yoga, no worries. A quick search of ""11 minutes of yoga"" on YouTube offers multiple free options for you to follow along.

Alternately, you could keep it really simple and practice one of my Minute MoFlows 11 times. These minute-long, yoga-inspired mobility sequences take your body through fundamental movements in all planes of motion.

Dance like no one is watching

I admit it — this is my favorite way to fit 11 minutes of movement into my day. There are few things as fun and liberating as dancing to your favorite tunes in the comfort of your own home. And when you're home alone, you don't have to dance like no one is watching; no one really is watching! It's just you and your jam. It only takes three or four songs to get to your 11-minute threshold, so drop your inhibitions and get your groove on.

Want some ideas for your playlist?

Here are three upbeat songs to get you moving that will fulfill your 11 minutes:

""Happy"" by Pharrell Williams (3:52)

""Uptown Funk"" by Mark Ronson featuring Bruno Mars (4:30)

Resist the resistance: fighting the good fight against bacteria,"Drug-resistant bacteria could lead to more deaths than cancer by 2050, according to a report commissioned by the United Kingdom in 2014 and jointly supported by the U.K. government and the Wellcome Trust. In an effort to reduce the potential infection-caused 10 million deaths worldwide, Penn State researcher Scott Medina has developed a peptide, or small protein, that can target a specific pathogen without damaging the good bacteria that bolsters the immune system.

Medina, an assistant professor of biomedical engineering, led the team who published its results Jan. 4 in Nature Biomedical Engineering.

""One of the best protective mechanisms we have to prevent infection are beneficial bacteria that inhabit our bodies, known as commensals,"" Medina said. ""For example, we often avoid food poisoning because our guts are already populated by helpful bacteria. There's no room for the pathogen to take hold and colonize. If you wipe out the good bacteria, opportunistic pathogens can take advantage and cause infections.""

Antibiotics can knock out an infection, but they can also kill off good bacteria, creating an opportunity for a potentially fatal secondary infection. Repeated exposure to antibiotics can also breed bacteria resistant to drugs. The potential for secondary infection and drug-resistant bacteria holds true for infections elsewhere in the body, too, according to Medina.

Led by biomedical engineering doctoral student Andrew W. Simonson, first author on the paper, the team set out to develop a peptide that could eradicate the pathogen that causes tuberculosis (TB), one of the top 10 causes of death worldwide, without harming surrounding good bacteria.

""There are great control strategies and treatments in place for tuberculosis, making it largely preventable and treatable, but drug-resistant TB is an emerging threat that is on track to becoming a serious global health problem,"" Medina said. ""It's a scary prospect.""

To develop a pathogen-specific antibacterial against TB, the researchers looked to the pathogen itself. The TB pathogen is wrapped in a thick envelope that is difficult to penetrate, especially compared to other bacteria.

""The envelope has pores, though -- channels through which the pathogen takes in nutrients and metabolites,"" Medina said. ""We asked if we could mimic these channels to design antibacterials that would create holes in the bacterial envelope, and ultimately kill the pathogen.""

The researchers made a peptide that seems to disrupt the protective outer coating of the pathogen, making the TB bacteria susceptible to antibiotics and die, but it does not interact with the good bacteria. Medina said they are currently studying the exact mechanism by which the peptide attacks the TB pathogen, but they suspect it has something to do with a fatty acid that lives on the pathogen's surface.

""There aren't many biochemical differences between the targeted pathogen and good bacteria, except for this surface lipid,"" Medina said. ""We think the interaction of our peptide with this fatty acid is one of the things driving this preferential interaction.""

He also pointed to the bacteria's thin carbohydrate region. In other types of bacteria, the carbohydrates form a thick defensive barrier that appears to insulate the bacteria against the peptide.

""It's not entirely clear why this works, but it's working on TB,"" Medina said. ""There's a 10-fold improvement on the effectiveness of antibiotics on this pathogen relative to the other good bacteria.""

Next, the researchers plan to investigate how to administer the peptide to treat TB in a full model system. Peptides tend to break down when injected, Medina said, so his team is working to develop an aerosol that would allow a person to inhale the peptides directly to the infected lung tissue.

""Once we understand why this peptide targets TB, and how to administer the peptide as a viable therapeutic, we can use this platform to design antibacterials toward other lung pathogens,"" Medina said.

Protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2 could last eight months or more,"LA JOLLA--New data suggest that nearly all COVID-19 survivors have the immune cells necessary to fight re-infection.

The findings, based on analyses of blood samples from 188 COVID-19 patients, suggest that responses to the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, from all major players in the ""adaptive"" immune system, which learns to fight specific pathogens, can last for at least eight months after the onset of symptoms from the initial infection.

""Our data suggest that the immune response is there--and it stays,"" LJI Professor Alessandro Sette, Dr. Biol. Sci., who co-led the study with LJI Professor Shane Crotty, Ph.D., and LJI Research Assistant Professor Daniela Weiskopf, Ph.D.

""We measured antibodies, memory B cells, helper T cells and killer T cells all at the same time,"" says Crotty. ""As far as we know, this is the largest study ever, for any acute infection, that has measured all four of those components of immune memory.""

The findings, published in the January 6, 2021, online edition of Science, could mean that COVID-19 survivors have protective immunity against serious disease from the SARS-CoV-2 virus for months, perhaps years after infection.

The new study helps clarify some concerning COVID-19 data from other labs, which showed a dramatic drop-off of COVID-fighting antibodies in the months following infection. Some feared that this decline in antibodies meant that the body wouldn't be equipped to defend itself against reinfection.

Sette explains that a decline in antibodies is very normal. ""Of course, the immune response decreases over time to a certain extent, but that's normal. That's what immune responses do. They have a first phase of ramping up, and after that fantastic expansion, eventually the immune response contracts somewhat and gets to a steady state,"" Sette says.

The researchers found that virus-specific antibodies do persist in the bloodstream months after infection. Importantly the body also has immune cells called memory B cells at the ready. If a person encounters SARS-CoV-2 again, these memory B cells could reactivate and produce SARS-CoV-2 antibodies to fight re-infection.

The SARS-CoV-2 virus uses its ""spike"" protein to initiate infection of human cells, so the researchers looked for memory B cells specific for the SARS-CoV-2 spike. They found that spike-specific memory B cells actually increased in the blood six months after infection.

COVID-19 survivors also had an army of T cells ready to fight reinfection. Memory CD4+ ""helper"" T cells lingered, ready to trigger an immune response if they saw SARS-CoV-2 again. Many memory CB8+ ""killer"" T cells also remained, ready to destroy infected cells and halt a reinfection.

The different parts of the adaptive immune system work together, so seeing COVID-fighting antibodies, memory B cells, memory CD4+ T cells and memory CD8+ T cells in the blood more than eight months following infection is a good sign.

""This implies that there's a good chance people would have protective immunity, at least against serious disease, for that period of time, and probably well beyond that,"" says Crotty.

The team cautions that protective immunity does vary dramatically from person to person. In fact, the researchers saw a 100-fold range in the magnitude of immune memory. People with a weak immune memory may be vulnerable to a case of recurrent COVID-19 in the future, or they may be more likely to infect others.

""There are some people that are way down at the bottom of how much immune memory they have, and maybe those people are a lot more susceptible to reinfection,"" says Crotty.

""It looks like people who have been infected are going to have some degree of protective immunity against re-infection,"" adds Weiskopf. ""How much protection remains to be established.""

The fact that immune memory against SARS-CoV-2 is possible is also a good sign for vaccine developers. Weiskopf emphasizes that the study tracked responses to natural SARS-CoV-2 infection, not immune memory after vaccination.

""It is possible that immune memory will be similarly long lasting similar following vaccination, but we will have to wait until the data come in to be able to tell for sure,"" says Weiskopf. ""Several months ago, our studies showed that natural infection induced a strong response, and this study now shows that the responses lasts. The vaccine studies are at the initial stages, and so far have been associated with strong protection. We are hopeful that a similar pattern of responses lasting over time will also emerge for the vaccine-induced responses.""

The researchers will continue to analyze samples from COVID-19 patients in the coming months and hope to track their responses 12 to 18 months after the onset of symptoms.

""We are also doing very detailed analyses at a much, much higher granularity on what pieces of the virus are recognized,"" says Sette. ""And we plan to evaluate the immune response not only following natural infection but following vaccination.""

The team is also working to understand how immune memory differs across people of different ages and how that may influence COVID-19 case severity.

Outdated Federal Flood Standards Put People at Risk,"NRDC and the Association of State Floodplain Managers (ASFPM) petitioned the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to update the agency’s rules for building and land-use in the nation’s floodplains, and to develop flood maps that project future flood risks.

Flooding—the most common natural hazard in the United States—is occurring more often due to climate change. As the seas rise and storms become more severe, flood risk will continue to increase, presenting grave challenges to our nation’s cities, towns, and neighborhoods.

NRDC and ASFPM are petitioning FEMA to reduce harm to the millions of people and properties already at risk from flooding and that will be increasingly vulnerable in the future. FEMA, through the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), has a legal responsibility to set safer standards to better protect people and property from flooding. The nation can no longer rely on the NFIP’s outdated building and land-use standards; standards that are unintentionally placing people in harm’s way.

Climate Change is exacerbating the risk of flooding

Ongoing and future changes to the climate, such as sea level rise and extreme rainstorms, combined with growing population density in coastal and other flood-prone areas, are increasing the likelihood of damage and human suffering caused by floods.

Rising sea levels are exacerbating several threats to coastal communities. The projected increases in sea level, average tropical storm intensity, and tropical cyclone rainfall rates will act to further elevate future storm surge risk. By one estimate, the number of affordable-housing units in the United States that are at risk of regular flooding is expected to triple by 2050 as sea levels rise.

The NFIP is the nation’s primary mechanism for addressing the flood-related impacts of climate change. Participating communities must adopt minimum building and land-use standards established by FEMA in order for residents to purchase insurance. FEMA flood maps that depict high-risk flood areas are also adopted by the more than 22,000 participating communities. These maps are the standard to which everyone turns—developers, engineers, banks, local land use officials, and homeowners and buyers all rely on these maps when siting, designing, or financing any project.

FEMA—as the sole administrator of the NFIP—has the authority to issue and/or amend the NFIP-implementing regulations to develop minimum building and land-use criteria for flood-prone areas. FEMA is also responsible for the issuance and approval of the program’s floodplain maps.

Congress mandates that the NFIP’s building and land-use requirements, to the maximum extent feasible, limit development of flood-prone land, and assist in reducing flood damages.

However, FEMA has not comprehensively amended the standards for building and land-use in flood-prone areas since the early 1970’s. As such, not only are the standards ill-equipped to address the floods of today—modern model building codes exceed FEMA’s requirements—the standards are also wholly insufficient to prepare communities for the impacts of climate change.

Congress also mandates FEMA include future conditions, such as projections of sea level rise, whenever it revises and updates NFIP flood maps. These maps govern where and how development and infrastructure is built. FEMA has not included future conditions on any of the 8,000 maps the agency has updated since Congress imposed its mandate. That means communities are making development decisions based on the climate of the past, not the future.

FEMA, through the NFIP, must set stronger standards to protect people and property against increased flood risk

Smart policy and the law both mandate that FEMA revise the NFIP-implementing regulations to adequately account for the increasing risk of flooding due to climate change. Safer and stronger construction and land-use standards -- and adequately mapping future conditions – provide communities the opportunity to anticipate and reduce flood risk, saving lives and protecting property.

NRDC and ASFPM are pursuing a petition to request FEMA to publicly respond to this worsening issue. We are requesting FEMA:

Require all new or substantially improved structures to be elevated higher than the 100-year flood to provide a margin of safety for extreme weather events and short-term effects of sea level rise

Ensure all new and revised NFIP floodplain maps depict how the floodplain will change over time, especially concerning sea level rise. Communities and developers rely on these maps to guide siting, design, and construction of all housing, commercial development, and public infrastructure.

Help more homeowners retrofit their homes to the growing threat of climate-related flooding by increasing and making flexible NFIP-related funding.

The body of science connecting climate change to an increased risk of flooding is clear. Numerous studies, including federal agency reports, prove a substantial connection between climate change and the growing frequency and severity of flood events, which greatly challenge our nation’s cities, towns, and neighborhoods.

Congress created the NFIP to reduce flood damages nationwide and to ease the federal government’s financial burden for providing disaster recovery. However, flood damages and federal spending on flood recovery are rising exponentially, implying the NFIP suggest the program is failing to achieve its primary goal. To reduce future flood damage and ensure people are protected from future flooding and sea level rise, the NFIP must adequately account for the impact of climate change on flood hazards.","['Joel', 'January']",https://www.nrdc.org,mostly high
Maxine Waters slams Trump for security concerns over election challenge,"National Review

On Tuesday, authorities in Wisconsin announced they would not be prosecuting Rusten Sheskey, the officer who shot and paralyzed Jacob Blake in August of last year — an incident that set off protests and riots in Kenosha, a city near the Illinois border. To justify this decision, they released two reports, one from the Kenosha County District Attorney’s Office and another from Noble Wray, a retired police chief and Obama-administration police reformer who’d been asked to render an independent assessment.Some important details of the shooting remain unclear, largely because Kenosha police did not have body cameras at the time. The incident was captured only on bystanders’ cell phones, videos from which do not show the whole situation. But when it comes to the question of a criminal prosecution, the documents are highly compelling: There is no way to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Sheskey fired without justification. If anything, the evidence tips in the opposite direction.Officer Sheskey and two other cops showed up in response to a call from Laquisha Booker, the mother of Blake’s kids. She said that Blake had taken the keys to her rental vehicle, and that he’d borrowed vehicles from her and crashed them in the past. She added that Blake was “not supposed to be here,” but that she’d let him visit for his son’s birthday. Police dispatchers told the officers that Blake had a felony arrest warrant for domestic-violence offenses and sexual assault, meaning they’d have to arrest him if they found him, under Kenosha Police Department policy.When they arrived, according to the officers and another witness, Booker said that Blake was trying to take her car and her kids — and Blake was seen putting a child in a gray SUV. Sheskey has said he wasn’t sure if the child was Blake’s or not. In truth, there were three kids in the SUV, all Blake’s.The cops tried to arrest Blake. He resisted. Two different officers shot him with Tasers, but he ripped out the probes. And to make matters worse, Blake produced a knife. Despite some claims in the media that Blake was “unarmed,” he admitted having the knife himself, there’s video of the officers telling him to drop it, and the weapon was found open in the SUV after the incident. According to the DA office’s report, Blake also resisted arrest with a knife in a 2010 incident.And then came a fateful series of decisions. As seen in the widely disseminated cell-phone video, Blake walked around the SUV and opened the door. Sheskey followed and grabbed Blake’s shirt, then fired seven times. He says he stopped shooting when Blake dropped the knife, consistent with his training to shoot until the threat stops.Were the shots justified? The key question is whether Sheskey reasonably believed lethal force was necessary to stop an imminent threat of “death or great bodily harm,” whether to him or to someone else.Sheskey, another officer, and some witnesses say that Blake twisted his body toward Sheskey before the shots rang out, which would have moved the knife toward the officer. Per the district attorney’s office, “Officer Sheskey stated that for the first time Jacob Blake showed intent to harm [as opposed to just resisting arrest] by driving the knife towards Officer Sheskey's torso.” Such an action would clearly justify deadly force.However, this gesture is not obvious in the video, at least not to me. (You can see the recording on YouTube, and move frame-by-frame using the “<” and “>” buttons on your keyboard.) That said, I wouldn’t say the video disproves these claims, either — the more important question in court, where the burden is on the prosecution — because the SUV’s door and the cops’ bodies obscure some of Blake’s movements.And at any rate, as Noble Wray’s report adds, whether> Blake drove the knife forward or not, a reasonable officer could view himself as being in imminent danger. P.O. Sheskey was literally holding on to Blake's shirt, and Blake had a knife in his hand, actively resisting, attempting to get into the vehicle. This circumstance is only compounded with the kids being in the vehicle.Of course, it was Sheskey’s own decision to grab Blake’s shirt, and there are various ways we might second-guess the officers’ actions even if we don’t prosecute them. But when it comes to those crucial final moments, the truth is that Blake put them in an impossible situation. They could have kept a safe distance from the guy with a sexual-assault warrant armed with a knife, but that would have meant letting that guy get into a vehicle they knew contained at least one child — an option that could lead to a high-speed chase or a hostage situation, both possibilities that Sheskey says he feared at the time. On the other hand, once Sheskey got close to a knife-wielding suspect, the chance he’d need to use deadly force shot way up, because knives are incredibly deadly at that range and there isn’t much time to ascertain and react to a suspect’s movements.Or, as Wray put it:> Officer Sheskey had determined that it was dangerous for the public and the child in the car to let Blake go. P.O. Sheskey felt he could not retreat once he made the decision that harm could come to the kids or to the public. I found Officer Sheskey's analysis was reasonable based on the limited information he had at the time. Officer Sheskey did not know the relationship between Blake and the child. I am not sure if it makes much difference. The U.S. Department of Justice reports in 2010 that 200,000 kids are abducted mostly by a family friend or parent. Blake's severe resistance to being taken into custody would lead a reasonable officer to believe that he would engage in a high-speed pursuit.I have no idea what actually would have happened if Sheskey hadn’t fired. I’m glad I didn’t have to make that decision myself. And I’m glad prosecutors aren’t dragging this situation out by pursuing a case they could never win.",[],https://news.yahoo.com,high

A final EPA rollback under Trump curbs use of health studies,"The Environmental Protection Agency has completed one of its last major rollbacks under the Trump administration, changing how it considers evidence of harm from pollutants in a way that opponents say could cripple future public-health regulation.

EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler is expected to formally announce completion of what he calls the “Strengthening Transparency in Regulatory Science” rule in an appearance before a conservative think tank on Tuesday. The EPA completed the final rule last week, but so far has declined to make the text public.

The new rule would require the release of raw data from public-health studies whose findings the EPA uses in determining the danger of an air pollutant, toxic chemical or other threat. Big public-health studies that studied the anonymized results of countless people have been instrumental in setting limits on toxic substances, including in some of the nation's most important clean-air protections.

Some industry and conservative groups have long pushed for what they called the transparency rule. Opponents say the aim was to handicap future regulation.

In an opinion piece in The Wall Street Journal on Monday night, Wheeler said the change was in the interest of transparency.

“If the American people are to be regulated by interpretation of these scientific studies, they deserve to scrutinize the data as part of the scientific process and American self-government,” Wheeler wrote.

But critics say the new rule could force disclosure of the identities and details of individuals in public-health studies, jeopardizing medical confidentiality and future studies. Academics, scientists, universities, public health and medical officials, environmental groups and others have spoken out at public hearings and written to oppose the change.

“This really seems to be an attempt by Wheeler to permanently let major polluters trample on public health,” said Benjamin Levitan, a senior attorney with the Environmental Defense Fund advocacy group. “It ties the hands of future administrations in how they can protect the public health.”

Story continues

The change could limit not only future public health protections, but “force the agency to revoke decades of clean air protections,” Chris Zarba, former head of the EPA’s Science Advisory Board, said in a statement.

Wheeler, in his Wall Street Journal piece, said the new limits wouldn’t compel the release of any personal data or “categorically” exclude any scientific work.

The EPA has been one of the most active agencies in carrying out President Donald Trump’s mandate to roll back regulations that conservative groups have identified as being unnecessary and burdensome to industry.

Many of the changes face court challenges and can be reversed by executive action or by lengthier bureaucratic process. But undoing them would take time and effort by the incoming Biden administration, which also has ambitious goals to fight climate-damaging fossil fuel emissions and lessen the impact of pollutants on lower-income and minority communities.",[],https://news.yahoo.com,high
Democratic victories in the Georgia runoffs ended Mitch McConnell's 6-year tenure as Senate Majority Leader and DC's most feared power broker,"The Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. KEVIN DIETSCH/POOL/AFP via Getty Images

The Democrats' victory in the Georgia runoffs was a disaster for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, costing him his dominant role in the Senate.

McConnell has been majority leader for six years, but once the Biden administration begins, he'll be the minority leader.

He'll also lead a Republican minority fractured by internal conflict and with no allies in the White House.

The changed circumstances will greatly diminish McConnell's powers, though he and the 49 other Republican Senators may still disrupt Democrats' agenda.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

Victory for both Democrats in the Georgia runoffs will bring to an end Mitch McConnell's six-year tenure as Senate Majority Leader, in which he was often characterized as one of the most powerful men in Washington, DC.

According to projections by Decision Desk HQ and Insider, both Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock beat Republican incumbents in the Georgia votes, unseating Sens. Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue.

This deprives Republicans of their majority, leaving 50 GOP Senators across the aisle from 48 Democrats and the two independent Senators who reliably vote alongside them.

Once Vice President-elect Kamala Harris, a Democrat, takes office, she'll be a tiebreaking vote, giving Democrats control of the Senate for the first time since 2015.

It'll be the party's first time in control of the Senate, House of Representatives, and White House all at once since 2011.

McConnell is a casualty of this electoral realignment. The Kentucky senator served as the majority leader since 2015, which gave him enormous power over proceedings.

His six-year tenure is the longest a Republican has held the role, but is now in its final days.

He is due to swap places with the Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a Democrat, and become the minority leader himself - meaning he longer decides what happens on the Senate floor.

This is the position he held before 2015, when Democrats last controlled the Senate.

Schumer previously said that Democratic control of the Senate ""would be the biggest difference maker"" for Biden enacting his plans.

McConnell would still be powerful in the minority, leading a group of 50 Republicans who could stymie any measures which don't have total support from Democrats.

But his ability to block Democratic ambitions would be far less pronounced, giving President-elect Joe Biden and his allies a path to enact legislation to further their agenda.

McConnell may also struggle to exert as much control over his party, reeling from losing the White House and Senate at once, and split over how to handle the attempts by outgoing President Donald Trump to overturn the election results.

As The Atlantic reported, McConnell in a recent private call, urged Republicans not to object when Congress votes to certify Biden's win on Wednesday. But several Republicans senators plan on doing so anyway.

Some in the party may also blame McConnell for the outcome in Georgia.

As Business Insider's Mia Jankowicz reported, McConnell stood in the way of Congress passing $2,000 stimulus checks, which became a pivotal issue in the election.

For now, Democrats are celebrating the prospect of a diminished McConnell.

This is from California Gov. Gavin Newsom:

And this is from Rep. Ted Lieu of California:

Andrew Yang, a former Democratic presidential candidate, also weighed in:

As did Massachusetts Rep. Joe Kennedy:

Fishermen rescue naked fugitive from crocodile-infested waters in Australia,"Two fishermen have rescued a naked fugitive who they found sitting on a tree branch in an Australian crocodile habitat. Cam Faust said Wednesday he and fellow recreational fisher Kev Joiner heard Luke Voskresensky, 40, yell for help on Sunday as they set crab traps from their dinghy in mangroves on the outskirts of the northern city of Darwin.

Faust said Voskresensky -- who was covered in mud, cuts and insect bites -- had explained that he had been lost for four days, survived by eating snails and had used his clothes ""for bits and pieces over the way.""

""It didn't make sense to us,"" Faust said, referring to the explanation for his nudity. ""He had a nest made up in the tree, and he was only laying a meter (39 inches) above the water and there were crocs in the water so he has done well to survive.""

Joiner said the friends hesitated before bringing Voskresensky on board.

""Once we'd seen how bad he was and how many cuts he had all over him and he was dehydrated and pretty weak ... we thought we'd better get him in the boat,"" Joiner said.

""We thought he just must have had a big night after New Year's and got lost and done himself a mischief in the bush,"" he added.

Faust said he stripped to his underwear and handed Voskresensky his shorts and a beer as the trio made their way back to Darwin.

""He looked like he needed a beer, although he was in a bad way,"" Faust said.

An ambulance was waiting at a Darwin boat ramp when they arrived. Voskresensky was taken to a Darwin hospital, where he was placed under police guard as he was treated for exposure.

Police said Voskresensky had been free on bail after being charged with armed robbery, multiple aggravated assaults, deprivation of liberty and stealing. But he had cut off his electronic monitoring device last week and attempted to evade police.

Because he was hospitalized, Voskresensky was excused from attending court on Tuesday to face new charges of breaching bail and aggravated assault, court official Xavier La Canna said.

Voskresensky will next appear in court on Feb. 9, La Canna said.

Faust said he decided against visiting Voskresensky in the hospital after discovering he had been wanted by police.",[],https://news.google.com,high
"Crashed websites, lines and scams frustrate Floridians looking for vaccinations","MIAMI — After a week and a half of leaving voicemails, writing emails and checking hospital websites, Harvey Rogers is hoping he and his wife are on a waiting list somewhere for a Covid-19 vaccine.

But the 75-year-old lawyer and resident of Pinecrest, an upscale Miami-Dade County neighborhood, is not really sure, since no one has replied.

Rogers, who is diabetic and has high blood pressure, said it’s frustrating.

“You feel the government is not telling you the truth,” Rogers said, adding that if the state and federal governments were more forthcoming about when and where the vaccine would be available there would be less of a “feeling of anxiety and being left out of the loop.”

Full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak

In the two weeks since Florida’s governor said the Covid-19 vaccine would be available to residents 65 and over, the vaccination registration process has been inconsistent across county lines, causing chaos, confusion and disappointment among its senior population and their relatives.

The registration process has been disparate and inconsistent: Websites have crashed; hospital phone lines are jammed; and scams have convinced people to pay for nonexistent vaccination slots. In some places, elderly people camped out overnight in hopes of receiving a vaccine.

Florida, with a population of more than 21 million, has had the third-highest count of Covid-19 cases in the United States over the past 7 days, just after California and Texas. It ranks sixth in deaths.

Exacerbating anxiety among seniors, Florida announced last week the first case of the more contagious coronavirus strain, known as B.1.1.7, which was first found in the United Kingdom.

With that in mind, it has become a race against the clock for many older Floridians to get vaccinated.

Part of the confusion is the state never developed a consistent strategy for its 67 counties to implement a vaccination program. While in some counties vaccines were allocated to public hospitals for distribution, other counties were relying on their health department to set up vaccines through the ticketing app Eventbrite.

Although several counties have successfully used Eventbrite to schedule appointments, it has led to scams in others. In Port Richey, north of Tampa, some of the people who showed up at a Covid-19 vaccination clinic in recent days thinking they had appointments found out that their names weren’t on the books, said Melissa Watts, a spokesperson for the Florida Department of Health.

Though the vaccinations are free, “people also said they were charged a fee to register,” Watts said in an email. “After looking into it further, we realized there was a fake Eventbrite account being used to scam people out of their money.”

It wasn’t immediately clear how many people were affected, but health officials said they were referring the complaints to state and local law enforcement for possible investigation. Two counties, Pasco and Pinellas, issued warnings to the public.

“Someone created a FAKE Eventbrite account to register for the COVID-19 vaccination. You should NOT be charged to register. Registration is FREE,” the counties said in identical tweets.

Someone created a FAKE Eventbrite account to register for the COVID-19 vaccination. You should NOT be charged to register. Registration is FREE.



The ONLY way to register at this time is by visiting our website at https://t.co/XEV02GdrN6 and go to VACCINE DISTRIBUTION. pic.twitter.com/qYKCqxsh5a — FL Health Pasco (@HealthyPasco) January 4, 2021

A spokesperson for Eventbrite said that the company is ""actively exploring how our platform can best support the effort to increase access to vaccines"" but cautioned users to verify the legitimacy of any pages.

""We recommend anyone registering for any COVID-19-related event verify and direct questions to their local health service officials,"" the spokesperson said.

Some counties said Eventbrite worked well for their residents because it’s easy to use. In Seminole County, people used Eventbrite to scoop up 2,500 vaccination appointments within 30 minutes of when they went live Tuesday morning, said Andy Wontor, a county spokesperson. People who have signed up for the county’s emergency text messages get a text with a link when appointments are available.

In Daytona Beach and Lee County in southwest Florida, thousands of elderly people camped out overnight in long lines after their county health departments announced they would distribute vaccines on a first-come, first-serve basis.

In Miami-Dade, the state’s most populous county with the highest number of Covid-19 infections, Mount Sinai Hospital in Miami Beach had been the sole entity administering vaccines to the public until Tuesday. Miami-Dade is ranked fourth in the country for confirmed cases, according to John Hopkins University and Medicine.

Mount Sinai has been inundated with phone calls and has been scheduling about a thousand appointments a day, according to hospital CEO and President Steven Sonenreich.

“There is tremendous demand to be vaccinated,” Sonenreich said.

Some hospitals and health departments have been criticized for requiring that appointments be scheduled exclusively online because some seniors are not that internet savvy and may have trouble using a computer or smartphone.

""We took into consideration every aspect of this in trying to make things as simple as possible,"" Sonenreich said.

Miami’s public hospital, Jackson Health System, rolled out an online platform Tuesday morning to schedule vaccinations. It went live at least two hours earlier than the hospital had announced it would, and in less than two hours, its 12,000 slots were filled, leaving many people angry that they were unable to secure an appointment. A hospital spokesperson said they would continue to open slots as more vaccines become available.

Broward County, with the second-highest number Covid-19 cases in the state, launched a sign-up website for their drive-through vaccination system last week, but it crashed hours after going live because of overwhelming demand. The website was taken down for maintenance. Shortly after relaunching Monday morning, the county’s health department announced that its 26,465 slots were filled.

But on Tuesday, the county reported another problem. “Due to a scheduling glitch, more appointments were given than could be served in a day,” it said in a tweet, announcing that some people had to reschedule.

Broward Health, the county’s public hospital, also experienced technical issues with its hotline due to the volume of calls. They announced the next day they were fully booked through February.

Gov. Ron DeSantis held two news conferences Monday, in Central Florida and Miami, and pressured hospitals to vaccinate people as quickly as possible and to operate seven days a week.

He said hospitals have the infrastructure and the personnel to get people vaccinated quickly. He also warned “hospitals that do not do a good job of getting the vaccine out will have their allocations transferred to hospitals that are doing a good job of getting the vaccine out.”

The state Department of Emergency Management is working with the Department of Health to identify state-run Covid-19 testing sites that can be converted into vaccination sites. The number of sites that open will depend on the number of vaccines the state receives on a weekly basis.

The state is also identifying places of worship in underserved communities where vaccines can be administered.

DeSantis said the state is expecting to get 50 percent more vaccines in January than it did in December. Right now, 80 percent of the vaccine doses have already been distributed to hospitals.

“I’m not going to say there hasn’t been any problems, but I think, all in all, the distribution has gone probably better than what would reasonably be expected,” DeSantis said.

SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) — Thousands of Orthodox Christian worshippers in Bulgaria on Wednesday ignored warnings issued by health authorities to abstain from mass gatherings due to the coronavirus pandemic and kept instead to their centuries-old Epiphany traditions.

Young men plunged into the icy waters of rivers and lakes across Bulgaria to retrieve crucifixes tossed by priests in ceremonies commemorating the baptism of Jesus Christ.

The legend goes that the person who retrieves the wooden cross will be freed from evil spirits and will be healthy throughout the year. After the cross is fished out, the priest sprinkles believers with water using a bunch of basil.

In the small mountain city of Kalofer in central Bulgaria, dozens of men dressed in traditional white embroidered shirts waded into the frigid Tundzha River waving national flags and singing folk songs. Inspired by bass drums and bagpipes and fortified by homemade liquor, they performed a slow “mazhko horo,” or men’s dance, stomping on the rocky riverbed.

The mayor of Kalofer, who usually leads the dance, this year did not enter the river to set an example that coronavirus regulations have to be followed.

A few local police officers attempted to prevent people from entering the river, threatening them with fines, but their calls were widely ignored.

Epiphany marks the end of the 12 days of Christmas, but not all Orthodox Christian churches celebrate it on the same day.

Full Coverage: Coronavirus pandemic

While the Orthodox Christian churches in Greece , Bulgaria and Romania celebrate the feast on Jan. 6, Orthodox Churches in Russia, Ukraine and Serbia follow the Julian calendar, according to which Epiphany is celebrated on Jan. 19, as their Christmas falls on Jan. 7.

Some Western Christian churches celebrate the religious holiday of Epiphany as the Three Kings Day, which marks the visit of the Magi, or three wise men, to the baby Jesus, and closes out the Christmas season.

"Fine: Brevard to receive additional 4,000 COVID-19 vaccines from DeSantis administration","Fine: Brevard to receive additional 4,000 COVID-19 vaccines from DeSantis administration

An additional 4,000 COVID-19 vaccine doses are expected to arrive in Brevard county in the next 48 hours, state Rep. Randy Fine said on Tuesday night, crediting Governor Ron DeSantis and Florida's Emergency Management Director Jared Moskowitz for the procurement.

Fine said that Omni Health and Health First would receive 2,000 doses each.

""To be clear the credit for this goes to Ron DeSantis and Jared Moskowitz for making this happen,"" Fine said.

The south Brevard State Representative has been lobbying Tallahassee to procure additional vaccines for the county following widespread public discontent with the Department of Health's vaccination rollout last week.

Vaccine supplies in the county to private suppliers had been exhausted and the supply given to the Department of Health in Brevard had been fully booked, with distribution proceeding at a rate of just a few hundred per day through the end of the month.

The DOH began vaccinations Monday but only has a supply of 3,500 doses. Appointments filled up fast despite overwhelmed phone lines last week that left many thousands of residents frustrated and angry.

A spokesperson for Health First in a statement said: “Health First is prepared to administer COVID-19 vaccines to community members as defined by the governor’s executive order. We are appreciative of Governor DeSantis and Florida’s Emergency Management Director Jared Moskowitz for their efforts to provide us with these vaccines and would like to thank Representative Fine for his actions to help protect Brevard.”

Dr. Craig Deligdish, a Vice President at Omni Health, confirmed that his group is expecting the vaccines to be here by Thursday.

“We have 10,000 people scheduled and we will begin vaccinating 1,000 people daily on Thursday and Friday,” said Deligdish. When asked if he planed to dispense his entire supply in two days, he said: “Yes. The only way to get more is to demonstrate that you can give it.”

Deligdish said Omni has a team of 10 schedulers and thousands of patients in the queue ready to be given appointments this week.

Presently, vaccines are being given to frontline healthcare workers and people over the age of 65. There are over 140,000 residents aged over 65 in Brevard County. So far just 7,384 residents have received a first dose of the vaccine, according to the state's Jan 4 report.

""I won't stop fighting until everyone who wants to get the vaccine gets a vaccine,"" Fine said, recognizing that there's a long way left to go.

""It's a start, and I think that by Omni and Health First proving they can get them, and get them in people's arms immediately, it will distinguish us, and show that we can get this and get it out,"" he said.

Gov. DeSantis on Monday told reporters that the state would be watching closely which hospital groups were most efficient at getting their vaccine allocations deployed onto the population, and that ""healthy competition"" would determine future allocations.

""I do not want to see a vaccine sitting around not being used when you could be putting a shot in an arm,” he said.

Florida senior citizens camp out in frigid temperatures for COVID-19 vaccine,"DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. – The push to vaccinate people over age 65 in Florida is drawing thousands of eager seniors in uneven rollouts across various counties, with some so set on getting a shot that they slept in their cars overnight.

In Daytona Beach, hundreds of senior citizens determined to get vaccinated against COVID-19 camped out in their vehicles in frigid temperatures to secure coveted spots in a vaccination line Tuesday morning, a day after seniors jammed the roads to the vaccination site.

Officials tried to avoid a repeat of Monday's traffic jams by opening a stadium's parking lot to overnight camping for those 65 and older. By 7:30 p.m. on Monday, senior citizens in 200 vehicles were on the property, set to brave overnight temperatures in the low 40s.

“We have blankets and we have pillows, so we’re OK,” Mary Wilde told WESH.

A couple of hours north, in Clay County, a small, north Florida region, people booked appointments online and walked in for their scheduled vaccination.

“Very quick, very easy. It didn’t hurt,” said 70-year-old Teresa Knight. She and her 74-year-old husband got the vaccine Tuesday morning after making an appointment online. “It gives me hope that we’re maybe coming out at the other end. I know it’s going to be difficult over the next few months but I feel hopeful.”

Some counties were using Eventbrite, an event management and ticketing website, to schedule vaccination appointments.

Broward County Mayor Steve Geller said during a news conference Tuesday that he’s being bombarded with emails and calls from senior citizens who are upset over how the vaccine distribution is going.

“Many seniors are panicking because they think they were promised the vaccine immediately,"" Geller said, adding some may have gotten that impression after Gov. Ron DeSantis issued an executive order giving priority to those over age 65. “They were not, but now they feel that faith has been broken.”

Geller added that the state simply does not have enough doses currently for all of Florida's 4.5 million seniors, including the 340,000 who live in Broward County.

“Not everyone will be vaccinated tomorrow or next week or next month,” he said.

In Miami, all vaccination signups and appointments offered on a website launched Tuesday were taken within minutes, The Miami Herald reported.

Tania Leets, a spokeswoman for Miami-based Jackson Health System, said 5,330 healthcare workers have been vaccinated, including staff, contractors and University of Miami doctors and residents. Out of more than 12,000 employees, 875 chose to not receive the vaccine immediately.

By Tuesday at 5 p.m., more than 289,000 Floridians had been vaccinated, most of them health care workers and first responders — about 1.3% of the state's population.

At John Knox Village, a retirement community outside Fort Lauderdale, 50 of the approximately 250 employees of its skilled nursing facility are to be vaccinated Wednesday as part of a state program, three weeks after 80 other employees received their first shot, said Mark Rayner, the village’s director of health services.

Rayner said staff members who originally refused the shot because they feared unknown side effects are slowly coming around as they see their colleagues suffer no ill consequences and they learn more about how the vaccine was developed. He said he would like to get to 100%, particularly among nursing assistants who have the closest daily contact with the community's 100 residents, but the vaccine is not mandatory. All wear extensive protective gear when in contact with residents, even those employees who are vaccinated.

“The No. 1 concern was how quickly the vaccine became available,” Rayner said. Developing a new vaccine usually takes years, but for this new coronavirus, one was completed in nine months. He said the employees didn’t understand that the government has been doing research on this type of vaccine for years and devoted billions of dollars into expediting the process after the pandemic began.

The state has received more than 960,000 doses of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, 700,000 doses of which are sitting in freezers waiting to be injected into the arms of Floridians. Both vaccines require two doses — an initial inoculation and a booster shot weeks later.

About 83% of those who have died from the disease in Florida have been older than 65. Florida has one of the nation’s oldest populations.

During news conferences Monday, DeSantis warned hospitals against stockpiling vaccines and urged them to work more quickly to vaccinate elderly Floridians.

On Tuesday, DeSantis said the supermarket chain Publix will start giving vaccinations to people 65 and over later this week in three central Florida counties.

As of Tuesday morning, there were 7,363 COVID-19 hospitalizations in Florida. According to state health department statistics, nearly 1.4 million people have been diagnosed with COVID-19 and more than 22,000 people have died since the pandemic began.

Former Atlanta police chief Erika Shields takes over Louisville police department,"Former Atlanta police chief Erika Shields will be leading the Louisville Metro Police Department, which was thrust into the national spotlight last year following the death of Breonna Taylor.

“I am honored to be selected for this important position at this important time,"" Shields said in a statement Wednesday.

""I recognize that there is a lot of healing that needs to happen in policing in general, and that LMPD is at a crossroads. But I think there is also an opportunity to get this right here in Louisville, and to create a model for other cities to follow.”

The announcement came on the same day that news broke that Dets. Joshua Jaynes and Myles Cosgrove were fired by the LMPD for their in the raid that resulted in Taylor's death. Jaynes was not at Taylor’s apartment on the night of the raid but had secured the search warrant. Cosgrove fired the shot that killed the former EMT.

Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer praised Shields as a ""change-agent throughout her long distinguished career"" and a ""well-respected visionary.""

""When she came before us as an applicant to be our chief, saying this was the only chief position she was interested in, and full of passion and with the skills and experience to achieve the improvements and reform that we need, she was the unanimous choice,"" he said at a news conference.

Shields said in June that she was resigning from the Atlanta Police Department, where she worked for more than two decades.

The announcement came hours after officer Garrett Rolfe fatally shot Rayshard Brooks, a Black man, in the parking lot of a Wendy's restaurant. Rolfe was fired after the shooting.

Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said in a statement at the time that Shields wanted to resign ""so that the city may move forward with urgency in rebuilding the trust desperately needed in our communities.""

Shields reiterated those sentiments at Wednesday's press conference.

""The killing of Rayshard Brooks was a tragedy. It was awful. And what I recognized is that there were multiple issues at play, even before that, but it culminated with Rayshard's killing. And what I realized is the longer I stayed, I was going to be a distraction and the city needed to move forward,"" she said.

Shields will begin her new role with the LMPD on Jan. 19. Former LMPD assistant chief Yvette Gentry will continue to serve as chief in the interim.

Gentry was brought on amid a national outcry over Taylor's death, a Black woman who died during a March police raid at her Louisville home.

Fischer said the city worked with the Police Executive Research Forum, a non-profit based police research organization, to help find a new chief. Shields briefly addressed critics of the decision, saying she hopes people look at her career.

""I would ask that people look at my body of work and see who I have been, what I have accomplished, what I require of a department,"" she said.","['Minyvonne Burke', 'Minyvonne Burke Is A Breaking News Reporter For Nbc News.']",https://news.google.com,high
$15 minimum wage edges closer as Democrats near Senate control,"President-elect Joe Biden (C) along with Democratic candidates for the U.S. Senate Jon Ossoff (L) and Rev. Raphael Warnock (R) greet supporters during a campaign rally the day before their runoff election in the parking lot of Centerparc Stadium in Atlanta.

A $15 federal minimum wage edged closer after Tuesday's Georgia runoff election, which seems likely to flip Senate control and unify government under the Democratic Party.

Such a pay boost would more than double the current federal minimum wage, $7.25 an hour, but would likely face resistance from some Republicans and business groups.

The Rev. Raphael Warnock, a Democrat, won the U.S. Senate runoff in Georgia on Tuesday, beating the Republican incumbent, Sen. Kelly Loeffler, according to NBC News projections.

Democrat Jon Ossoff was leading Republican David Perdue, whose Senate seat expired Sunday, in the other Georgia race, which was too close to call midday Wednesday, according to NBC News.

Democratic victories in those contests would give Democrats control of the Senate, the House and the presidency. Congress is scheduled to confirm President-elect Joe Biden's win over President Donald Trump on Wednesday.

""It's absolutely a priority,"" Mark Hamrick, senior economic analyst at Bankrate, said of Democrats passing legislation to set a higher pay floor.

Governor Cuomo Announces Proposal to Legalize and Create an Equitable Adult-use Cannabis Program as Part of the 2021 State of the State,"Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced a proposal to legalize and create a comprehensive system to oversee and regulate cannabis in New York as part of the 2021 State of the State. Under the Governor's proposal, a new Office of Cannabis Management would be created to oversee the new adult-use program, as well as the State's existing medical and cannabinoid hemp programs. Additionally, an equitable structure for the adult-use market will be created by offering licensing opportunities and assistance to entrepreneurs in communities of color who have been disproportionately impacted by the war on drugs. Once fully implemented, legalization is expected to generate more than $300 million in tax revenue.

""Despite the many challenges New York has faced amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, it has also created a number of opportunities to correct longstanding wrongs and build New York back better than ever before,"" Governor Cuomo said. ""Not only will legalizing and regulating the adult-use cannabis market provide the opportunity to generate much-needed revenue, but it also allows us to directly support the individuals and communities that have been most harmed by decades of cannabis prohibition.""

The Governor's proposal builds on years of work to understand and decriminalize cannabis for adult use. In 2018, the Department of Health, under Governor Cuomo's direction, conducted a multi-agency study which concluded that the positive impacts of legalizing adult-use cannabis far outweighed the negatives. It also found that decades of cannabis prohibition have failed to achieve public health and safety goals and have led to unjust arrests and convictions particularly in communities of color.

In 2019, Governor Cuomo signed legislation to decriminalize the penalties for unlawful possession of marijuana. The legislation also put forth a process to expunge records for certain marijuana convictions. Later that year, the Governor spearheaded a multi-state summit to discuss paths towards legalization of adult-use cannabis that would ensure public health and safety and coordinate programs regionally to minimize the cross-border movement of cannabis products.

Building on that important work, the proposal reflects national standards and emerging best practices to promote responsible use, limiting the sale of cannabis products to adults 21 and over and establishing stringent quality and safety controls including strict regulation of the packaging, labeling, advertising, and testing of all cannabis products. Cannabis regulation also offers the opportunity to invest in research and direct resources to communities that have been most impacted by cannabis prohibition.",[],https://news.google.com,high

"HHS secretary recommends states open Covid vaccinations to older Americans, vulnerable groups","U.S. Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Alex Azar speaks during a news conference in the Brady Press Briefing Room of the White House in Washington, August 23, 2020.

Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar on Wednesday urged states against ""micromanaging"" their allotted coronavirus vaccine doses, saying it's better to get the shots out as quickly as possible even if they haven't been able to vaccinate all of their health-care workers.

""There is no reason that states need to complete, say vaccinating all health-care providers, before opening vaccinations to older Americans or other especially vulnerable populations,"" Azar told reporters during a press briefing.

""If they are using all the vaccine that is allocated, ordered, distributed, shipped and they are getting it into health-care providers arms, every bit of it, that's great,"" he added. ""But if for some reason their distribution is struggling and they are having vaccine sit freezers, then by all means you ought to be opening it up to people 70 and older.""

U.S. officials are trying to pick up the pace of vaccinations after a slower-than-expected initial rollout. The coronavirus pandemic in the U.S. is continuing to accelerate, with the nation recording at least 219,200 new Covid-19 cases and at least 2,670 virus-related deaths each day, based on a seven-day average calculated by CNBC using Johns Hopkins University data.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has provided states with an outline that recommends prioritizing health-care workers and nursing homes first, but states can distribute the vaccine as they see fit.

Azar said Wednesday that states providing some ""flexibility"" around who gets the first doses ""is the best way to get more shots in arms"" faster. ""Faster administration could save lives right now, which means we cannot let perfect be the enemy of the good,"" he said. ""Hope is here in the form of vaccines.""

More than 4.8 million people in the U.S. have received their first dose of a coronavirus vaccine as of Tuesday at 9 a.m. ET, according to the CDC. The number is a far cry from the federal government's goal to inoculate 20 million Americans by the end of 2020 and 50 million Americans by the end of this month.

U.S. officials acknowledged vaccine distribution has been slower than they had hoped. Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, told STAT News on Tuesday that she expects vaccine rollout to speed up ""pretty massively"" in the coming weeks.

Global health experts had said distributing the vaccines to some 331 million Americans in a matter of months could prove to be much more complicated and chaotic than originally thought. Besides manufacturing enough doses, states and territories also need enough needles, syringes and bottles to complete the vaccinations.

The logistics of getting the vaccine and administering it are complex, requiring special training. Pfizer's vaccine, for example, requires a storage temperature of minus 94 degrees Fahrenheit. Both Pfizer and Moderna's vaccines cannot be refrozen and need to be administered at room temperature and within hours or risk going bad.

Azar also said the holidays likely played a factor in the slow rollout of the vaccines, saying health-care providers knew lining up millions of people for vaccinations through December would be difficult.

Nearly 20 million doses of vaccine have been delivered to more than 13,000 locations across the country, Gen. Gustave Perna, who oversees logistics for President Donald Trump's vaccine program Operation Warp Speed, said during the same briefing.

Vaccine distribution is going ""very well,"" he said, adding officials are still working to improve the process. ""Our goal is to maintain the steady drumbeat so that states have a cadence of allocation planning and then the appropriate distribution to the right places as designated.""

U.S. formally links Russia to massive 'ongoing' cyber attack; scope of hacking unclear,"U.S. formally links Russia to massive 'ongoing' cyber attack; scope of hacking unclear

U.S. officials Tuesday formally named Russia as the likely source of a massive, ongoing cyber attack that has compromised key government and private sector systems across the country.

A joint statement issued by the FBI, Department of Homeland Security and Director of National Intelligence and National Security Agency characterized the hacking campaign as ""likely Russian in origin"" and responsible for perhaps all of the recently discovered compromises of public and private networks.

""At this time, we believe this was, and continues to be, an intelligence gathering effort,"" officials said in an acknowledgment that the attack is continuing weeks after the breach was made public. ""We are taking all necessary steps to understand the full scope of this campaign and respond accordingly.""

The public attribution to Russia is the most definitive accounting yet after separate statements last month by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and then-Attorney General William Barr who both pointed to the Kremlin. Barr left the administration Dec. 23.

President Donald Trump, meanwhile, has sought to downplay the breach while suggesting that China was to blame for the attack. Trump has accused the news media of inflating the seriousness of the hacks and has repeatedly deflected blame from Russia, undermining his own administration’s warning last month that the attacks posed a “grave risk” to government networks and the private sector.

Cyber attack: Private sector, infrastructure, all levels of government at risk

Although federal authorities have so far traced the attack's launch back to March, it remains unclear just how long operatives have been lurking in some of the government's most critical agencies – including the departments of State, Homeland Security, Treasury and Commerce – and what may have been lost or compromised.

The U.S. has said the hackers employed sophisticated tactics not seen in past intrusions, complicating efforts to eliminate the threat.

The attackers penetrated federal computer systems through a popular piece of server software offered through a company called SolarWinds.

The threat apparently came from the same cyberespionage campaign that has afflicted cybersecurity firm FireEye, foreign governments and major corporations.

The system is used by hundreds of thousands of organizations globally, including most Fortune 500 companies and multiple U.S. federal agencies, which are now scrambling to patch their networks.

""Of the approximately 18,000 affected public and private sector customers of SolarWinds' Orion products, a much smaller number has been compromised by follow-on activity on their systems,"" federal officials said in the Tuesday statement. ""We have so far identified fewer than 10 U.S. government agencies that fall into this category, and are working to identify the non-government entities who also may be impacted.

""This is a serious compromise that will require a sustained and dedicated effort to remediate,"" the officials said.

The Russian government did not immediately respond.

Senate Intelligence Committee Vice Chairman Mark Warner said the administration's statement was slow in coming.

“It’s unfortunate that it has taken over three weeks after the revelation of an intrusion this significant for this Administration to finally issue a tentative attribution,"" Warner said. ""I would hope that we will begin to see something more definitive, along with a more public pronouncement of U.S. policy towards indiscriminate supply chain infiltrations of this sort in the future.

""We need to make clear to Russia that any misuse of compromised networks to produce destructive or harmful effects is unacceptable and will prompt an appropriately strong response,"" he said.",['Kevin Johnson'],https://news.google.com,high
18-year-old woman charged in September murder at Jacksonville Beach home,"Samantha Allison Weiner charged with second-degree murder and other charges in the September 2020 shooting death during a robbery in Jacksonville Beach

JACKSONVILLE BEACH, Fla. – An 18-year-old woman was arrested early Wednesday and charged with murder in the fatal shooting of a 20-year-old man during an armed home burglary in Jacksonville Beach in September.

Ezekiel Archuleta, of Jacksonville, died after he was shot Sept. 21 at his home on Penman Road North at 12th Avenue. Officers dispatched to a burglary in progress found the victim in the front yards with gunshot wounds. He died at a hospital.

After the shooting, police charged the 22-year-old resident of the home, Roman Steward Jr., with armed possession of marijuana. He was not charged with the shooting.

Jacksonville Beach police said Steward told investigators that his 18-year-old ex-girlfriend, Samantha Allison Weiner, had asked several people to rob him in retaliation for a recent breakup. Police said they learned Weiner provided Archuleta with Steward’s address and specific information to complete the robbery, including who lived in the home, suggested entry points and what items were to be taken.

After confirming that Archuleta was among those Steward solicited to commit the robbery, police said they obtained an arrest warrant for her charging her with second-degree felony murder and solicitation to commit robbery. She was arrested at 1:16 a.m. Wednesday at her residence in St. Johns County.

Archuleta’s aunt told News4Jax in September was shocked to learn of his death. She said Archulata’s 14-year-old brother was walking with him when the person inside the home came out and started shooting.

“He was a good kid at his core, very much loved by his family,"" the aunt told News4Jax. ""While he was a good kid, he had gone down a different path and he and his family were working to get him back on the right path. He just got a new job and is one of four siblings.”

"Inside Haven's downfall: How Jeff Bezos, Jamie Dimon, and Warren Buffett set their healthcare venture up for failure","Haven, Amazon's health venture with JPMorgan and Berkshire Hathaway, is disbanding.

Details about Haven have been few and far between ever since it was announced in 2018. It started without a clear mandate from the founding companies and never landed on one.

Haven's first big bet on primary care was shut down when the coronavirus pandemic started. Dozens of employees left the venture in the spring and summer, including Dr. Atul Gawande, its CEO.

The venture's failure is coming at a shock to an industry that thought it could be transformational.

Business Insider tracked Haven's three-year struggle to find a voice in healthcare before it disbanded.

For more stories like this, sign up here for Business Insider's daily healthcare newsletter.

When Haven formed in January 2018, the healthcare industry flinched.

It was announced with a cryptic press release, when its founders Amazon, JPMorgan, and Berkshire Hathaway said they were starting an independent company, free from profit-making incentives, that would focus on improving care and lowering cost for their employees.

The ideas behind Haven were born out of the personal frustrations of those companies' CEOs, Jeff Bezos, Jamie Dimon, and Warren Buffett, three people familiar with the partnership told The New York Times in 2018.

They met over the course of several months, discussing the difficulties of covering the medical costs of employees, which have been rising steadily for years. They went ahead with the new venture without a clear solution, in part so that they could start recruiting for it, The Times' report said.

""Our group does not come to this problem with answers. But we also do not accept it as inevitable,"" Buffett said in the announcement. ""Rather, we share the belief that putting our collective resources behind the country's best talent can, in time, check the rise in health costs while concurrently enhancing patient satisfaction and outcomes.""

Also in statements, Bezos said the venture was clear-eyed about the level of difficulty in achieving its goals but that success was worth it. The fruits of its labor could eventually benefit all Americans, not just the employees of the founding companies, Dimon added.

The lack of specifics was allowed, for a while.

Employers insure roughly half of all Americans and spend $880 billion on healthcare each year. Haven's three founding companies, in particular, could throw their weight around, or so people thought. Their leverage, as of 2019, was more than 1.2 million employees and $4 billion in annual healthcare spend.

The day Haven was announced, billions of dollars in value was erased from healthcare companies based solely on the notion that three of the biggest and most powerful companies and CEOs were coming for the lunch of industry gatekeepers like health plans, drug companies, and middlemen such as pharmacy benefits managers.

But in retrospect, Haven's fundamental flaw was laid bare from the start.

The new company was in the ""early planning stages,"" the release said, with no name, headquarters, CEO, long-term management team, or mission. Apart from bringing down the ""costs"" of healthcare, Haven didn't have a particular aspect of the $3.8 trillion industry it wanted to focus on.

In short, details of the new venture were ""sketchy,"" CNBC reported at the time. And over the course of the next three years, the mission never really crystallized.

This account of the venture's ultimate downfall is based on Business Insider's own reporting, as well as reporting from The Information, Stat, The New York Times, CNBC, and other outlets.

Employer-funded healthcare is a notoriously difficult problem to tackle, as Nikhil Krishnan, a former CB Insights analyst and current writer, chronicled in a popular graphic titled ""The Tech Person Entering Healthcare.""

Nikhil Krishnan's depiction of the typical obstacles befalling tech founders in healthcare. Nikhil Krishnan

On their road to enlightenment, founders eventually run into the difficulty of getting huge employers on board who pay for most healthcare costs in the US but are risk-averse and data-driven, he told Business Insider.

Unlike most upstarts, Haven had brand recognition and, at least in theory, a large employee population to experiment on — but couldn't overcome a poor organizational structure, he said.

""My general gist is everyone should be applauded for trying to take big swings in healthcare,"" Krishnan said. Combining three large companies with vastly different employee groups across the country set the venture up to be difficult, he said — so did Amazon's internal work in healthcare.

""It was just going to be complicated from the outset,"" he added.

Haven began without a clear focus and never found one

Haven found its leader, Dr. Atul Gawande, in June 2018.

The practicing surgeon, former advisor to President Bill Clinton, Harvard professor, author, and New Yorker staff writer was known as a visionary who could explain tough healthcare problems in plain terms.

He champions the adoption of simple ""checklists"" in medicine that cut down on surgical errors by 50%, according to Gawande's preliminary data.

But he had no experience managing a business and never fully left his various other roles to focus exclusively on Haven, Stat's Erin Brodwin and Casey Ross reported.

""Atul is a visionary. What he's not is the CEO of an operating company that can do something different in health care,"" Kimberly MacPherson, the executive director of health management at the University of California at Berkeley's Haas School of Business, told Stat.

For a while after he accepted his post, Gawande didn't know what Haven was about any more than Bezos, Buffett, and Dimon did. Five months after he joined, he told audience members at The New Yorker Festival he suspected the venture might focus on people in the lower-middle class who can't afford commercial insurance but don't qualify for federal assistance.

The joint health venture didn't have a name until nine months after he joined, in March 2019.

Passionate about primary care, Gawande led Haven toward its first pilot, code-named ""Starfield,"" which hoped to connect employees with dedicated primary-care teams, The Information's Paris Martineau reported in July.

The pilot, launched in November 2019, flopped just five months later.

Haven's only big project flopped, and it lost too many leaders

Starfield was built around JPMorgan's Ohio employees and a local provider, Central Ohio Primary Care, according to The Information.

The pilot program had a few aspects working against it. For one, Haven's culture of secrecy didn't help with getting the word out to eligible employees that the new app was up and running in Columbus, Martineau reported. It also lacked support from Amazon, Business Insider found, which was building a similar program internally.

To make matters more difficult, the founding companies' operations and employees were spread out all over the country.

Brian Marcotte, the longtime president and CEO of the National Business Group on Health, told OMERS Ventures on Monday that local pilots like this are difficult to scale beyond the specific markets they're tied to.

""To me, changing health care will start with some kind of virtual, scalable solution that will integrate with local health care but won't be defined by local health care,"" Marcotte said.

In April, Gawande told employees Haven was shutting down Starfield, which Gawande attributed to the business pressures associated with the coronavirus pandemic, The Information's Martineau reported. The company then laid off roughly 20% of its employees. Gawande left his CEO post just a few weeks later and joined the board as chairman.

By that point Haven was gasping for air. The venture lost 21 staff members between May and December, dropping to just 59 employees, according to Stat and LinkedIn data.

The heads of product management, recruiting, provider analytics, and product design all left, Stat reported, as well as Serkan Kutan, the chief technology officer, and Yvette Pasqua, the vice president of engineering.

In December, Haven confirmed to Business Insider it was no longer focused on primary care. While ongoing pilots and at least one data project with the founding companies were still underway, the upstart never landed on another guiding strategy that worked for all its bosses.

Strained relationships with founders led to confusion

While Gawande was the right leader for Haven, he lacked the necessary support from the human-resources departments at the founding companies, one person close to Haven, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told Business Insider.

Haven got started by the three CEOs airing out their frustrations, not the benefits managers of the companies who would be making the day-to-day decisions about what moved forward. Amazon, for instance, did not enroll employees in Haven's primary-care pilot.

""Once you put bodies and a budget together collectively, you'd better be sure that each of the parties in a joint venture are agreed as to how they win as partners,"" the person said. ""And there was no agreement, and there's still no agreement.""

In a statement, Brooke Thurston, a spokesperson for Haven, said the three companies would continue to work together loosely in pursuit of their individual ideas, depending on what makes sense for their employee populations.

The Amazon Care app. Amazon Care

Amazon's bet on controlling healthcare spend internally and beyond the company is Amazon Care, a venture similar to Haven's pilot that provides employees with home visits, remote care, and prescription deliveries. As Business Insider discovered, it's plotting a national expansion and wants to work for other employers.

Beth Galetti, a senior vice president of HR at Amazon, sat on Haven's board. She's been involved in Care's incubation, a person close to Amazon said. The Care division got started through a combination of the HR department and Grand Challenge, Amazon's secretive lab.

""No one at Amazon was happy about Haven because it was a shot across the bow from Bezos that the internal team wasn't doing its job to control costs,"" a person familiar with the matter previously told Business Insider. ""Hence, everything Haven brought them was dead on arrival.""

JPMorgan will continue its pilots with Aetna and Cigna, a person with direct knowledge of the matter told Business Insider. Bloomberg first reported that the bank started rolling out the Haven program to workers in Ohio and Arizona in 2019. The plans eliminated deductibles and offered perks for when workers hit certain wellness goals.

Uniform benefits, meanwhile, are not really Berkshire Hathaway's thing. The conglomerate includes about 60 companies from Geico to Fruit of the Loom, with more than 360,000 employees worldwide.

""Warren Buffett has been extraordinarily successful running a holding company by investing in businesses where management maintains decision-making authority,"" the person close to Haven said. ""He doesn't buy companies to turn them around. So it's not in his nature to do anything more than offer the option.""

There's still room to disrupt employer-funded healthcare

The purpose behind Haven is even more important now than it was three years ago, Elizabeth Mitchell, the CEO of the Pacific Business Group on Health, told Business Insider.

The US healthcare system is continuously consolidating, leading to higher prices, and the coronavirus pandemic is adding financial pressure on companies to cut costs, she said.

""We were really encouraged by the C-suite leadership we saw from Haven,"" Mitchell said.

PBGH for its part is incubating a stealth venture based on something that member companies Walmart, McKesson, and Lowe's brought to the coalition to scale about eight years ago, Business Insider has learned.

It will seek out the best doctors for employers, with focuses on specialties and primary care, Mitchell said.

Employers will be able to participate when it suits them, and PBGH will do the dirty work of understanding contracts and finding the best care, making it scalable, she said.",['Blake Dodge'],https://news.google.com,high
Amazon promises $2B for affordable housing projects near its corporate offices,"Amazon is planning to spend $2 billion over the next five years to invest in affordable housing in the three cities where its major offices have helped jack up housing prices, the company said today.

The company will be using loans, lines of credit, and grants to ""preserve and create"" 20,000 committed affordable units for low- to moderate-income families in the general areas around Seattle, Nashville, and Arlington, Virginia, where it has a large corporate presence, Amazon said in a press release this morning.

""Affordable housing"" is generally defined as priced to be within reach of families making 80 percent or less of the area median income. Amazon specifically is targeting households coming in between 30 and 80 percent of the area AMI. The AMI for the Washington, DC, metro area, including Arlington, is $126,000, and so basically any household making between $37,000 and $100,800 falls within that range. In Seattle, the AMI is $119,400, and so that window would include households making between approximately $35,800 and $95,500.

Amazon has already made two significant investments in affordable housing in those regions, the company added. The first is a combination loan-and-grant package of $340 million it granted the Washington Housing Conservancy to acquire an apartment complex, Crystal House, in Arlington.

""We don't have control over how the [housing] markets respond to a large employer coming into the market or expanding in the market, but we can play a role in how Amazon's growth is impacting our local communities,"" Catherine Buell, head of community development for one of Amazon's philanthropic arms, told The Wall Street Journal. ""Particularly as we're expanding our corporate presence, we're working to get ahead of the issue as much as we can.""

Amazon's pledge won support among affordable housing advocates in Virginia. ""We're thrilled that Amazon is really making a quantum leap in their investment in affordable housing,"" Nina Janopaul, president and CEO of the Arlington Partnership for Affordable Housing, told Ars. Amazon contributed $1 million to an APAH project in 2020, Janopaul added, ""and we look forward to helping to accelerate the development of affordable homes in Arlington with their support.""

Corporate support for affordable housing initiatives from Amazon has also helped boost support at the state level, Janopaul added, which benefits everyone. ""So I think it's a great partnership, that corporate leadership, and then that helps to motivate government leadership. They work in synchrony.""

The Amazon effect

Amazon has been based in Seattle for more than 20 years, so its effect on the local housing market has been slow to build and not always easy to separate out from other factors affecting the city. Over in Virginia, however, Amazon's much-ballyhooed 2018 ""HQ2"" announcement had a visible and immediate effect on already-high housing costs.

Arlington has been an expensive place to live for decades, and a major building boom in ""luxury"" condo and apartment developments near Metro stations over the past 10 to 15 years has only accelerated the upward trend. Amazon's announcement that it would take office space in an Arlington neighborhood—Crystal City, a stone's throw from both the Pentagon and Reagan National Airport—added even more fuel to the fire.

In the six months after Amazon made its HQ2 announcement, housing prices in Arlington County rose by almost 18 percent. Speculators jumped in first, within days of the deal becoming public, but regular high-income earners who just wanted to live near Amazon jobs weren't far behind. By August 2019, Redfin had dubbed Arlington and neighboring Alexandria the most competitive housing markets in the country.

The housing crunch in Arlington is not only terrible for low-income families but challenging for middle-class households as well. When the county published its annual profile in July, the average value of a single-family detached home was $949,500 ($805,000 for a townhouse). Rents are also high: the average rent in Arlington in the 2020 report was $2,024 for a one-bedroom apartment, $2,627 for a two-bedroom, and $3,367 for a three-bedroom.

There are currently about 8,300 committed affordable units in Arlington, so Amazon's pledge to create thousands more will indeed significantly expand that number. As in California, however, corporate philanthropy can only go so far without an overhaul of local policy to fill in the missing housing gaps.",['Kate Cox'],https://news.google.com,high

"Thousands of L.A. healthcare workers sickened by coronavirus, worsening crisis in hospitals","The astronomical coronavirus surge in Los Angeles has infected thousands of healthcare workers in recent weeks and exacerbated the strain on hospitals struggling to care for critically ill patients.

More than 2,200 people who work at hospitals in L.A. County tested positive for the virus in December alone, constituting roughly a third of all hospital infections reported during the pandemic. Whereas in previous months nursing homes and outpatient clinics suffered the most illnesses, besieged hospitals and their beleaguered workers have been hit hardest by the winter surge.

Dr. Anish Mahajan, chief medical officer of Harbor-UCLA Medical Center in Torrance, said that adequately staffing his hospital — where the ICU is stretched to 150% of its normal capacity — is a constant challenge, with staffers out because they are ill with COVID-19 or quarantining due to exposure. Hospitals across California have reported similar trends.

“Somebody who wears their PPE perfectly and deals with high-risk patients doesn’t get sick at work. ... When they get home, their teenager might give them COVID. We see that a lot,” Mahajan said. “We end up short-staffed in everything, from nurses to doctors to even the custodial staff that helps us turn over the rooms. And all of that makes it even more difficult to take an onslaught of more and more patients.”

The recent explosion of the coronavirus has trapped L.A.'s hospitals in a vicious cycle. The more people who are ill, the more likely others will become infected, both at and away from work. That, in turn, intensifies staffing shortages at hospitals — at the very moment the public needs medical care the most.

Outbreaks have also jumped dramatically in recent months among grocery store workers and retail employees and at other workplaces. But the rise in infections comes at a crucial time for L.A.'s hospitals as they buckle under a deluge of patients and turn away ambulances, line hallways with gurneys and cram bodies into overflowing morgues.

Officials reported Tuesday that a record 7,898 people with COVID-19 were currently admitted to hospitals in L.A. County, a record-breaking total that is expected to grow in the coming weeks.

“We’re going to continue to work with organizations across the county to ensure that healthcare workers at every location are protected,” L.A. County Department of Public Health Director Barbara Ferrer said this week.

Since the pandemic began, 28,448 healthcare workers and first responders have tested positive for the coronavirus in L.A. County, and 132 have died from the virus, Ferrer said. Hospitals, nursing homes and outpatient clinics account for the majority of cases.

Infections among healthcare workers have swelled as overall cases have grown. In a single week in mid-December, as L.A. County reported more coronavirus infections than ever, 2,363 healthcare workers and first responders fell ill with COVID-19, compared with 360 two months prior.

Hospitals are where these problems compound. Nurses and doctors are stretched thin as COVID-19 patients overrun hospitals, and staff are out with the disease themselves, said UCLA emergency room nurse Marcia Santini.

“We have COVID that’s rampant and we have a very sick population — coupled with that we have a staffing crisis,” she said. “All of that combined is putting a real stress on these facilities.”

Santini became sick with COVID-19 last month, though she is not certain how she contracted the virus. She cared for COVID-19 patients before becoming ill, but her husband showed symptoms before her, suggesting he got it at work and then passed it on to her.

Her illness became so severe that she couldn’t breathe and was admitted to the hospital for days. Nearly three weeks later, she remains easily fatigued. “I’ve never gone through anything like this,” she said.

At Kaiser Permanente San Jose Medical Center, at least 43 staff members recently contracted the coronavirus, including one who died, part of an outbreak possibly linked to an employee who wore an inflatable holiday costume in the hospital to lift spirits.

In Fresno County, where only 11 ICU beds remained available Tuesday, a recent rash of healthcare workers falling ill or needing to stay home due to exposure to the virus has hampered hospitals’ ability to treat patients, said interim health officer Dr. Rais Vohra.

“We have hundreds of people who are out who could otherwise be working in our hospitals,” Vohra said. “There are so many cases that are happening, whether it’s a healthcare worker who’s sick or a relative who’s ill, that really affects our ability to deliver care because that person then has to take time off.”

Unlike in the spring, when a shortage of personal protective gear and ventilators was the most pressing issue, concerns during this latest surge have been largely centered around staffing. The U.S. Department of Defense is lending combat medics and nurses to assist hospitals across California.

L.A. County officials have redeployed nearly 800 clinic nurses to work in its public hospitals, while other local hospitals have recruited doctors and nurses from other departments to help out in the ICU, though with varying success.

“Quite frankly, you get comfortable in your field of knowledge, and when you’re put somewhere else, you’re a little bit of a fish out of water,” said Dr. Frank Candela, who is on the medical executive committee of West Hills Hospital. “People are spread thin. They’re persevering. They’re adapting, but it puts a big strain on the person doing it, as well as patient care.”

Many healthcare workers cited the emotional toll of seeing not just strangers severely ill, but their own colleagues hospitalized with the virus, or even killed by it. Candela said that Ernesto Ruelas, an environmental service worker at the hospital, died of COVID-19 this week. “He is deeply missed,” Candela said.

For the most part, staff who are falling sick with COVID-19 are believed to have caught it outside the hospital, he said. But that hasn’t always been the case.

In an unfortunate incident over the summer, COVID-19 infections were transmitted among staff who spent time together in the break room, often without masks and distancing, he said. That outbreak ultimately spread to patients too, he said.

Candela said the hospital has since begun to stagger breaks so people don’t eat lunch at the same time and now prohibits bringing in food to share with others. But he said he hopes his hospital’s experience shows the public that even small lapses can have devastating consequences.

“We sort of learned the lesson the hard way: that we can’t let our guard down,” he said.

This dark moment of the pandemic is brightened by ongoing vaccinations, healthcare workers say.

The first people vaccinated in California will receive their second dose this week, which offers 95% immunity to the coronavirus. With that protection, hospitals eventually won’t be so short-staffed, Mahajan said.

“Right now is the worst time because the vaccine hasn’t been out long enough,” he said. “But that’s going to be less and less of an issue as the days and weeks of January go by.”

Mahajan has warned his staff that the extreme surge will continue for at least five more weeks. L.A. County officials said this week that they expect the number of people hospitalized with COVID-19 to grow by at least 1,000 within the next two weeks, though only about 20 ICU beds are available.

“One of the things I’ve tried to tell our staff as we entered the Christmas holidays is that this is halftime,” Mahajan said. “I’ve asked them to pace themselves over the holidays — take some time for themselves and their families — because we have so much more we have to do.”","['Staff Writer', 'Soumya Karlamangla Has Been A Reporter At The Los Angeles Times Focusing On Health Issues Since She Was Raised In Thousand Oaks', 'Graduated Uc Berkeley With Degrees In Biology', 'English Literature.']",https://news.google.com,high

Joe Biden's economic agenda is suddenly alive again. America could use the jobs,"New York (CNN Business) Democrats are on the cusp of taking control of the Senate, breathing new life into President-elect Joe Biden's economic agenda at a time America's job market could really need the help.

The job market recovery that began in May has run out of steam and economists predict the unemployment rate rose to 6.8% between November and December. It would be the first increase in the jobless rate since April.

Biden wants to solve America's jobs crisis with infrastructure investments and green energy. That could help to create jobs in the long term -- including one million jobs in the auto industry and 10 million clean energy jobs , according to Biden's plan. It could also help with automation eating into America's manufacturing jobs and displacing workers.

But the United States has a short-term jobs crisis to deal with, too, and that will be tricky for Biden and Congress to solve.

America's economy needs more assistance beyond the stimulus bill President Donald Trump signed into law last week. That package expands state jobless benefits by a $300 per week through March 14 and adds an 11-week extension for other pandemic unemployment programs created by the CARES Act last spring.","['Anneken Tappe', 'Cnn Business']",https://news.google.com,high
Dallas-Based Pizza Inn Issues Bizarre Statement In Support of Trump’s Bogus Voter Fraud Claims,"On Tuesday, Dallas-based pizza chain Pizza Inn issued a truly bizarre statement in support of President Trump’s repeatedly debunked claims of election fraud.

The statement, issued via press release and the company’s official Twitter account, calls for a “10-day audit of the vote” ahead of President-Elect Joe Biden’s inauguration, set for January 20. “Pizza Inn is not advocating to overturn the election, nor do we think hastily certifying the results in Congress tomorrow is appropriate,” the statement reads. “We are simply saying that since we don’t know what happened, the prudent course of action is to conduct a 10-day audit of the vote to make certain that the man we inaugurate as President of the United States on January 20 is the rightful winner.”

Of course, there’s already a great deal of clarity on the fact that Biden won the 2020 presidential election, as evidenced by the fact that all 50 states have officially certified election results. Biden won 306 electoral college votes, well beyond the 270 threshold required to win the presidency. Trump, meanwhile, garnered just 232. In the weeks after the election, Trump has railed against the results, alleging a wide range of voter fraud in states like Georgia and Wisconsin. It’s worth noting that Trump also lost the popular vote, securing 46.9 percent of votes to Biden’s 51.4 percent.

Just this week, the Washington Post published audio of the president pressuring Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to find more than 11,000 votes so that Trump could secure the win in the Peach State. The president’s legal team has also filed a litany of lawsuits with the attempt to overturn the election results, all of which have been thrown out as evidence of this purported voter fraud seems nigh impossible to find.

In addition to the audit, Pizza Inn’s leadership suggests a series of measures to secure “election integrity,” ranging from the exclusive use of paper ballots to eliminating mail-in voting because we “should not prioritize voter convenience over election integrity.”

“We will no doubt be vilified by some for these reasonable and responsible suggestions,” said Rave Restaurant Group CEO Brandon Solano. “We may even be accused of supporting voter suppression for recommending solutions that we believe would advance the cause of election integrity. But pursuing this worthy, non-partisan goal is not suppression; it’s democracy in action.”

Owned by Rave Restaurant Group, Pizza Inn was founded in Dallas in 1958 and operates more than 200 restaurants across several states out of its headquarters in The Colony. Surprisingly, only three of those are open in DFW — one in Mesquite, another in East Dallas, and a third in Duncanville.

The statement issued by Pizza Inn even acknowledges the absolute bizarreness of a regional pizza chain making a spontaneous foray into electoral politics. “We fully understand the risks of wading into such heated political waters, but we believe some things – such as America’s election integrity – are too important to stand by silently,” the statement reads. “Pizza Inn respects citizens’ rights to agree or disagree with us, boycott us or visit us in solidarity.”

Facebook tells businesses it has no choice but to comply with upcoming App Tracking Transparency feature in iOS 14,"Facebook continues to panic about upcoming privacy changes in iOS 14. The company has sent a new email to businesses today informing them that it has no choice but to comply with the iOS 14 App Tracking Transparency feature. Otherwise, Apple could remove Facebook from the App Store completely.

As first reported by iMore, Facebook has sent another round of emails to businesses informing them that while it disagrees with Apple’s planned changes, it has no choice but to follow them. Facebook says that the App Tracking Transparency feature, which requires apps to obtain consent from users before tracking them across other websites and apps, will have “hard-hitting implications across targeting, optimization, and measuring campaign effectiveness.”

The company also says that it believes “personalized ads and user privacy can coexist,” which is also a claim Apple has made. The two companies clearly have different versions of what constitutes “user privacy,” though.

Apple’s requirement that all apps in the App Store show a prompt to iOS 14 users in accordance with their AppTrackingTransparency framework will have hard-hitting implications across targeting, optimization, and measuring campaign effectiveness for businesses that advertise on mobile devices and across the web. Apple’s changes will benefit them, while hurting the industry and the ability for businesses of all sizes to market themselves efficiently and grow through personalized advertising. We believe that personalized ads and user privacy can coexist.

Also in the email, Facebook tells businesses that it has “no choice” but to show the prompt seen at the top of this story. Otherwise, Facebook tells businesses that it believes Apple could block Facebook and its other apps from the App Store completely.

Facebook told businesses that whilst it disagrees with Apple’s solution, it has ‘no choice’ but to show the opt-in prompt and to continue using Apple’s device identifier for advertising. The company states that it believes Apple could block Facebook and its other apps from the App Store if it doesn’t comply, bringing ‘further harm to the businesses and users that rely on our services.’

Finally, Facebook says that if users do opt out of tracking, there could be a reduction in “ad effectiveness and limitations on measurements.”

This is not the first time Facebook has warned businesses about the potential impact of the new iOS 14 App Tracking Transparency feature. Last month, 9to5Mac reported that Facebook was warning users about the impacts on marketing efforts. Facebook also took out a full-page ad in US newspapers to slam Apple’s changes.

The App Tracking Transparency feature will roll out sometime in early 2021. Apple had originally hoped to launch it with iOS 14 in September, but it ended up delaying the feature to give developers more time to prepare.

Samsung's new Frame TV rotates between portrait and landscape modes,"Samsung has carved out a unique niche for itself with The Frame, a TV set that looks more like an artsy picture frame than a piece of consumer electronics. You can even buy high quality artwork to display when you're not binging Netflix. This year, Samsung is making the The Frame live up to its name in an even bigger way: the new 43-inch model can rotate between landscape and portrait modes.

If this sounds familiar, it's because Samsung offered the same feature with its Sero TV in 2019. While it's unclear if that set was a success for Samsung, it makes sense for the company to roll the rotating feature into the popular Frame line. It fits the high art concept Samsung has been going for, and it’ll likely be useful for customers who may want to display portrait artwork.",[],https://news.google.com,high
Microsoft tried to buy Nintendo and EA ahead of the original Xbox launch,"Microsoft reportedly attempted to buy some of the biggest names in gaming, including Nintendo, to create exclusive titles for the original Xbox.

In a new report from Bloomberg, many of the people who worked on the console in the run-up to its release outlined attempts to acquire the likes of Nintendo, EA, and Square Enix.

Having announced the Xbox in 2000, Microsoft was looking around for games for its new system and the developers who would make them. According to Bob McBreen, then head of business development, ""the first company we reached out to buy was EA."" That offer was met with a swift ""'no thanks,'"" so Microsoft turned its attention to Japanese giant Nintendo.

Kevin Bachus, director of the console's third-party relations, said ""Steve [Ballmer, former Microsoft CEO] made us go meet with Nintendo to see if they would consider being acquired."" Apparently, however, that conversation did not go well: ""They just laughed their asses off. Like, imagine an hour of somebody just laughing at you. That was kind of how that meeting went.""

Bloomberg's report also touches on unsuccessful attempts to purchase Square Enix, as well as Mortal Kombat developer Midway. The former told Microsoft that its asking price was too low, while the latter was still attached to its business with PlayStation. Eventually, it worked out for Microsoft. They would *ahem* settle for Halo developer Bungie, creating one of the Xbox's most successful and enduring franchises.

While the acquisition of a company as massive as Nintendo might have been unthinkable in the early days of the Xbox, Microsoft's purchase of Zenimax Media, announced last year and expected to complete in a few months' time, brought the likes of Bethesda, Arkane, and Id Software into the Xbox family.

"For Its Latest Trick, OpenAI’s GPT-3 Generates Images From Text Captions","In the latest demonstration of popular large language model GPT-3’s power and potential, OpenAI researchers today unveiled DALL·E, a neural network trained to create images from text captions across a wide range of concepts expressible in natural language.



OpenAI’s GPT-3, released last June, showed that natural language inputs could be used to instruct a large neural network to perform a variety of text generation tasks. The same month, the company’s ImageGPT research showed that similar neural networks could generate high-fidelity images.



To start the new year, OpenAI’s DALL-E builds on this, “to show that manipulating visual concepts through language is now within reach.”



Deriving its name from a portmanteau of artist Salvador Dalí and Pixar’s WALL·E, DALL·E is a 12-billion parameter version of GPT-3 trained to generate images from text descriptions using a dataset of text–image pairs. DALL·E boasts a diverse set of capabilities, such as creating anthropomorphized versions of animals and objects, combining unrelated concepts in plausible ways, rendering text and applying transformations to existing images.

A transformer-based language model, DALL·E’s vocabulary has tokens for both text and image concepts. It receives both text and images as a single stream of data containing up to 1280 tokens, and is trained using maximum likelihood to sequentially generate tokens to generate images from scratch. It can also regenerate regions of existing images in a manner consistent with the text prompt.



OpenAI today also introduced CLIP (Contrastive Language–Image Pretraining), a neural network that efficiently learns visual concepts from natural language supervision. The researchers say CLIP can be applied to any visual classification benchmark by simply providing the names of the visual categories to be recognized, which is similar to the “zero-shot” capabilities of GPT-2 and -3.



Trained on a wide variety of images with a wide variety of natural language supervision abundantly available on the Internet, the network can be instructed in natural language to perform a variety of classification benchmarks without directly optimizing for each benchmark’s performance.

Robustness gap between CLIP and the original ResNet50 on ImageNet zero-shot without using any of the original 1.28M labelled examples

CLIP is able to learn from unfiltered, highly varied, and highly noisy data, and CLIP models are significantly more flexible and general than existing ImageNet models, the researchers say. The results from their tests with CLIP show that agnostic pretraining on Internet-scale natural language — which has powered recent breakthroughs in NLP — can also be leveraged to improve the performance of deep learning in fields such as computer vision.

Get two years of PlayStation Plus for only $58 today,"If you were gifted a PS5 over the holidays or still own a PS4 and need to renew your PlayStation Plus membership, you can snag two one-year PlayStation Plus subscriptions at Eneba for $58 when you enter the discount code 2021PLUS at checkout (while supplies last). Usually, one year of PlayStation Plus would set you back $60, so getting two one-year subscriptions for less than the normal retail price is a real bargain, and this promotion will likely sell out quickly.

Ideally, this is great for a PS4 or PS5 user looking to stack up on PlayStation Plus subscriptions for the next two years, or if you want to gift one PlayStation Plus membership to a friend and keep the other one for yourself. If you don’t need more than one PlayStation Plus membership, Eneba has another promotion allowing you to buy one year for just $30 with code JANDEALS. Otherwise, it’s $31 without the code.

One year of PlayStation Plus allows PS4 and PS5 gamers to play games online and receive perks such as free games each month and exclusive discounts on the PlayStation Store. You can get two one-year subscriptions for $58 with code 2021PLUS entered at checkout. $31 at Eneba

When testing out the deal, I found that the 2021PLUS discount code will only work if you have two PlayStation Plus one-year subscriptions in your cart. The codes are also region-locked, so you will need a US PlayStation Network account to redeem the membership.

PlayStation Plus is a paid online subscription service that comes with a ton of perks for members, including occasional discounts during PlayStation Store sales and free games that usually switch up on a monthly cadence, among other things. A PlayStation Plus subscription is compatible with both the PS4 and PS5.

Additionally, PS5 owners receive an additional incentive for having an active PlayStation Plus subscription: access to the PlayStation Plus Collection, a digital library of “generation-defining” first- and third-party games that were released on the PS4, such as Bloodborne, God of War, and Ratchet and Clank.","['Taylor Lyles', 'Jan']",https://news.google.com,high
How Singer Transformed the Porsche 911 Into a Beastly Off-Road Racer,"Singer Vehicle Design made its name by reimagining the Porsche 911, but after debuting the results of its Dynamics and Lightweighting Study in 2018 it seemed the company had found the outer limit to just how far it could push the model in terms of performance and design. Turns out, there was still more to come. This morning, Singer unveiled the culmination of its second major client-requested research and development project, the All-Terrain Competition Study (ACS), culminating in 911 rally racers reborn to tackle Dakar or Baja.

“We at Singer are motorsport nerds in our hearts and demonstrating our understanding of the discipline required our off-road vision to display deeply legitimate competition credentials from the structural engineering, to the bodywork ethos, to the mechanical package,” said Rob Dickinson, Singer’s founder and executive chairman, in the official announcement. “So much of what we’ve done for the last decade has been inspired by Porsche’s competition success and the All-terrain Competition Study provides us the opportunity to showcase that idea literally and vividly.”

While influenced by the Porsche 911 SC/RS examples campaigned by the likes of Rothmans in the World Rally Championships (WRC) of the 1980s—Rothmans won 12 prominent rally races in 1984 and ’85 alone with the model—Southern California–based Singer selected the 1990 Porsche 964 platform for the ACS-modified vehicles.

Crucial to the process was Singer’s collaboration with rally expert Richard Tuthill and his team, winners of the 2019 East African Safari Classic as well as numerous other top finishes in the sport. Tuthill, whose facility is in Oxfordshire, UK, also worked on the original Rothmans cars back in the day.

Presenting a substantially elevated ride height, the permanent all-wheel-drive coupe with plated limited-slip differentials is powered by an air-cooled, 3.6-liter twin-turbo flat-six engine mated to a five-speed sequential transmission. Singer claims output begins at 450 hp and 420 ft lbs of torque, but varies depending on the intended form of competition. Beneath the carbon-fiber body panels lies a bolstered monocoque chassis, a long-travel suspension system with five-way adjustable dampers (two per corner) and an enlarged fuel tank.

The entire package runs on 8-inch x 16-inch forged aluminum wheels shod in BF Goodrich All-Terrain rubber and complemented by four-piston monoblock steel disc brakes. Onboard features include race-specific GPS navigation, a pair of full-size spare tires and an integrated hydration system for the driver and navigator.

“It was really the chassis development that took a while,” said Singer CEO Mazen Fawaz during a conversation with Robb Report about the study, which was roughly three years in the making. “Richard [Tuthill] led that. And then you have a body structure that needed to be designed, and that’s a process that Rob [Dickinson] led. This is not just a 911 with a roll cage. We knew we had to go big. We don’t really do trendy. We had to do something that’s going to be a competitive off-road desert racer. Fully engineered, it’s like a WRC racing car with some trophy truck in it.”

And Fawaz should know, as he’s raced trophy trucks with Formula 1 driver Jenson Button’s team, Rocket Motorsport, and plans to do so again this season. Testing of the ACS-modified Porsches will be done with a team consisting of Fawaz, Tuthill, Le Mans veteran Marino Franchitti and automotive consultant Chris Harris.

According to Fawaz, the car’s first official event will most likely be the National Off-Road Racing Association’s Yokohama Mexican 1000, in April. Once delivery of the two vehicles—one in Parallax White and the other, tailored more to paved explorations, in Corsica Red—is made to the commissioning customer, the ACS package will be available to other Singer clients, with pricing determined by the extent of modifications desired. Each example will be completed in the UK and comes with the option of racing support from Tuthill and crew.

Talking about the first car produced, Fawaz sounds like a proud parent. “It’s this perfect balance of heritage and capability, and there’s no shortcut on it—it’s very Singer,” he says. “In our heads, we wouldn’t change it. And when you get there, it’s very exciting.”","['Viju Mathew', ""Viju Mathew'S Most Recent Stories"", 'How Singer Transformed The Porsche Into A Beastly Off-Road Racer', 'First Ride', 'The Polaris Slingshot Thinks It S A Supercar', 'It Might Be Right', 'After Disappearing For Years', 'British Marque Alvis Car Company Is Back']",https://news.google.com,high
Netflix on the Wii U and 3DS will shut down on June 30th,"Nintendo is winding down support for the Netflix app on the Wii U and 3DS. The app will be shut down for existing users on June 30th, and if you’ve never downloaded it, it isn’t available anymore. You can redownload the app if you’ve downloaded it in the past, however.

“Starting Dec 31st, 2020, the Netflix app will no longer be available for new users to download from Nintendo eShop on the Wii U console or Nintendo 3DS family of systems,” Nintendo said in a statement on the listings for the Wii U and 3DS Netflix app. “During that time, it will be possible for existing users to re-download these applications. Service for existing users will continue until June 30th, 2021. Thank you to everyone who enjoyed Netflix on these platforms over the years.”

Nintendo discontinued the 3DS in September and quickly moved on from the Wii U in favor of the Nintendo Switch, so it’s not all that surprising that the company is shutting down the Netflix app on the older platforms. But Netflix still isn’t on the Switch, despite former Nintendo of America president Reggie Fils-Aimé saying days after the Switch’s launch in March 2017 that the company was talking with companies like Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon about bringing their services to the console.

Hulu launched in November 2017, but there’s still no Netflix app.","['Jay Peters', 'Jan']",https://news.google.com,high

Onkyo and Pioneer's 2021 receivers offer 8K video and 2-way Bluetooth,"Onkyo

CES

After taking a year off, Pioneer and Onkyo return to CES with brand-new receivers for 2021, offering up-to-date features including 8K video and Dolby Atmos.

All the AV receivers have HDMI 2.1 compatibility -- with 8K video and gaming features such as VRR -- while also offering Dolby Atmos and DTS:X. Onkyo has four models, the most notable being the NR6100 which is the replacement for CNET's Editor's Choice, the TX-NR696. Meanwhile Pioneer has three.

Like the models Onkyo and Pioneer have released over the last few years, the products include a complete suite of streaming protocols: Apple AirPlay 2, Chromecast, Works with Sonos and DTS Play-Fi. FireConnect doesn't appear to be available but Play-Fi can perform the same function, so it's not missed. The receivers will also allow voice control via both Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa.

The receivers offer two-way Bluetooth communication for streaming from phones or listening on headphones. A powered second zone is included on all models. They can also connect a ""headphone dock"" for listening to two different sources in the same room, for example.

Here's what we know about Onkyo's 2021 receiver range:

Onkyo TX-NR5100

5.2.2 channels

80 watts per channel (stereo)

Four HDMI inputs and two outputs (with eARC)

Onkyo TX-NR6100

5.2.2 channels

100 watts per channel (stereo)

Six HDMI inputs and two outputs (with eARC)

Onkyo TX-NR7100

7.2.2 channels

100 watts per channel (stereo)

Seven HDMI inputs (one front) and two outputs (with eARC)

Dirac Live calibration

Onkyo TX-RZ50

7.2.2 channels

120 watts per channel stereo

Seven HDMI inputs (one front), two outputs (with eARC)

Dirac Live calibration

Pioneer's models include the following receivers:

Pioneer VSX-LX105

5.2.2 channels

Six HDMI inputs, two outputs

80 watts per channel

Pioneer VSX-LX305

7.2.2 channels

Seven HDMI inputs (one in front), two outputs

100 watts per channel



Pioneer VSX-LX505

7.2.2 channels

Seven HDMI inputs (one in front), two outputs

120 watts per channel

After two years it's good to see Onkyo return to one of its main strengths -- AV receivers -- and I have high expectations for the NR6100 in particular.

Capcom Updates Content Creation and Streaming Rules,"Capcom has updated its content creation and streaming rules, laying emphasis on the sharing of spoilers and commercial use of its intellectual properties. While the company is cracking down on those two issues specifically, streaming and the sharing of content on Twitch, Facebook, YouTube still remains permissible with some caveats.

For example, Capcom mentions that content creators can still monetize their content through streaming platforms such as Twitch, Facebook, YouTube within the guidelines and rules of those platforms. However, content creators are no longer allowed to limit access to content through paywalls. This includes the selling of new content or the requirement of a paid subscription to access said content.

The official statement goes on to mention that all unofficial and unauthorized pre-release footage is strictly prohibited. This includes leaks of any kind. This is not limited to the distribution “in-game content” from leaked copies of a game prior to its official release date. Additionally, third party softwares or “or devices that circumvent intended protection of Capcom titles” are strictly prohibited as well.

Capcom also goes on to mention that “using Capcom titles to create video and other content, including mods, that is illegal, racist, sexist, prejudicial to sexual orientation, sexually explicit, disparaging, promotes hate crimes, or is otherwise offensive is not tolerated.” Mods will be reviewed on a case by case basis.

Finally, Capcom mentions that failure to abide by these new terms may result in Capcom taking action to have your video content removed.","['Kazuma Hashimoto', 'Translator', 'Streamer', 'Kazuma Spends His Time Playing A Variety Of Games Ranging Farming Simulators To Classic Crpgs.']",https://news.google.com,high
Neil Young searching for heart of gold ... by selling song catalogue to investors,"Neil Young has become the latest musician to strike gold with his song catalogue, selling a 50% stake in his music to a British investment company in a deal announced on Wednesday.

The Hipgnosis Songs Fund said it had acquired half of the copyright and income interests in some 1,180 songs written by the 75-year-old rock star, composer of ""Heart of Gold,"" ""Rockin' in the Free World"" and ""Cinnamon Girl.""

Terms were not disclosed.

The deal comes a month after Bob Dylan sold publishing rights to more than 600 songs to the Universal Music Publishing Group for a reported fortune of between $300 million and a half billion dollars. Stevie Nicks sold an 80 percent stake in her music to Primary Wave for a reported $100 million.

Merck Mercuriadis, founder of Hipgnosis Songs Fund Limited, said that he bought his first Neil Young album when he was seven years old.

""'Harvest' was my companion and I know every note, every word, every pause and silence intimately,"" he said. ""Neil Young, or at least his music, has been my friend . . . ever since.""

The businessman also said Young's late manager, Elliot Roberts, was equally an idol to him.

In an industry where music sales have dwindled and the concert industry is on hold due to the coronavirus pandemic, song publishing is seen as an increasingly valuable asset. The companies generally push for use of an artist's songs in movies, video games and advertising.

The latter use has been a sticking point for Young, whose 1988 song ""This Note's For You"" sharply criticized artists who leased their music for advertising campaigns. The accompanying video parodied ads that featured Michael Jackson and Eric Clapton.

""Ain't singin' for Pepsi""

In the song, Young sang: ""Ain't singin' for Pepsi, ain't singin' for Coke. I don't sing for nobody. Makes me look like a joke.""

In the years since, it has become much more common for musicians to earn income through advertising campaigns. But at least through 2016, Young continued to resist having his music used this way, according to Rolling Stone magazine.

It was unclear whether the Hipgnosis deal augers a change in that policy.

In Wednesday's announcement, Mercuriadis said that his company and Young ""have a common integrity, ethos and passion born out of a belief in music and these important songs. There will never be a 'Burger of Gold' but we will work together to make sure everyone gets to hear them on Neil's terms.""

Young has released some 70 albums as a solo artist and with bands like Buffalo Springfield, Crazy Horse and Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young.",[],https://news.google.com,high
Tanya Roberts' death: Can a UTI be fatal?,"Urinary tract infections are often associated with painful urination or burning sensation, so when Tanya Roberts’ longtime partner revealed that her death followed hospitalization for complications stemming from one, it came as a shock to many.

But what Roberts was allegedly suffering from is different from the more common UTI that is experienced by up to 60% of women, one expert told Fox News.

""Having a UTI is a super common thing for a woman,"" Maria Sophocles, MD, gynecologist and sexual medicine specialist of Women’s Healthcare of Princeton, told Fox News. ""Some get recurrent UTIs, which is if you get a UTI within three months of your original infection – which is mostly reinfection.""

TANYA ROBERTS IS DEAD, PARTNER SAYS AFTER PREMATURE DEATH DECLARATION

Sophocles said UTIs are usually easy to treat and easy to diagnose for physicians because of the symptoms it causes, such as burning while urinating, blood in the urine, or the frequent need to urinate.

""It is something you want to treat if you have one, because UTIs mostly start in the lower urinary tract, which is the bladder and the urethra,"" she said. ""As long as it is in the lower urinary tract it’s not dangerous, but it’s uncomfortable.""

However, if the infection goes untreated or undetected, the infection can ascend upward and impact the kidneys or other organs. It’s not clear if Roberts had any underlying health conditions, or if she had sought treatment for a UTI prior to her hospitalization, but Lance O’Brien told Fox News earlier this week that she was experiencing complications from a UTI that spread to her kidneys, liver and gallbladder before it ""got into her blood.""

TANYA ROBERTS' FAVORITE ACTING JOB WAS 'THAT 70S ROLE,' LONGTIME PARTNER SAYS

Sophocles, who was not involved in Roberts’ treatment, said that upper urinary tract infections are much more likely to land a patient in the hospital, and when a death occurs from UTI ""it’s almost never from the simple straightforward lower UTI.""

""It’s almost always people who have upper UTI kidney infection, almost always older people and it’s almost always people who are in the hospital,"" she said, adding that those who develop lower UTIs and seek prompt treatment are unlikely to experience any of the severe complications.

""Treatment for lower UTIs is simple,"" she said. ""It’s an antibiotic, anywhere from a three- to seven-day course to control the bacterial infection. Once it’s in the upper urinary tract, you may need IV antibiotics in the hospital. If this is what Tanya Roberts was hospitalized or treated for – the bacterial infection did not get under control.""

Hydration, Sophocles said, is key in preventing UTIs from occurring in the first place, as is making sure the vagina stays full of estrogen, especially for women who are post-menopausal. Many also believe that urinating after sex can help stave off infection, as sex acts as a mechanism for bacteria to enter the vagina, but Sophocles points out that hydrating to ensure the bladder is full before urinating is most efficient.

""When we acidify the urine – like taking a vitamin C supplement – bacteria doesn’t like that so that’s another preventative measure,"" she said. ""There are also prescription medications that are not antibiotics, but an antibacterial that prevents the bacteria from binding to the wall of the bladder.""

Cranberry extract supplements have been shown to be helpful, she added.

Despite prevention and recognizing the symptoms, in rare cases it is possible for a UTI to go undetected, she warned. In these cases, if urine suddenly has an order or you see blood, and are possibly suffering from lower back pain or fever and chills, you should consult a physician, Sophocles said.",['Alexandria Hein'],https://news.google.com,high
Katie Couric will guest host ‘Jeopardy!’ after the final Alex Trebek episodes air,"Longtime network news star Katie Couric has been signed to take over the hosting reins of “Jeopardy!” for a week, according to several people familiar with the plan.

Couric will be among the first guest hosts to helm the iconic game show after the final episodes with long-running emcee Alex Trebek air this week. Trebek, who died Nov. 8 after battling pancreatic cancer, taped the programs in October.

Couric declined to comment when asked about the booking or and whether she is interested in being Trebek’s successor on a full-time basis. A representative for Sony Pictures Television, which produces “Jeopardy!,” also declined to comment.

The producers of “Jeopardy!” have previously stated their plans to have guest hosts after the final Trebek episodes air until a permanent replacement is chosen. “Jeopardy!” champion Ken Jennings, who has an overall deal with Sony, has also been booked to handle the program. Episodes with Jennings as host are scheduled to air starting Jan. 11.

It’s likely that the guest host stints will play a role in determining who will succeed Trebek, who fronted the syndicated version of the program since its launch in 1984.

Couric, 63, is one of television’s best known personalities, thanks to her massively successful run as co-anchor of NBC’s morning news franchise “Today.” The program was No. 1 in the ratings during most of her run from 1991 to 2006.

She went on to spend five years as anchor of “CBS Evening News.” She hosted a syndicated talk show for the Walt Disney Co. and worked as a correspondent for ABC News.

Johnny Depp Must Face Ex's Libel Suit After His Attorney Declared 'Hoax',"That would be Depp, soon battling a countersuit brought by Heard in the same case.

Heard alleges that her former husband has deployed social media bots against her in alleged violation of Virginia's Computer Crimes Act. She says he's directed a concerted effort to tarnish her career and interfere with endorsements and acting gigs as retaliation for what she has publicly claimed about their troubled marriage. As for Heard's story of being abused, after Depp attorney Adam Waldman told media outlets that it was ""fake"" and all part of a ""sexual violence hoax,"" Heard included defamation counterclaims too. Now comes White's first big decision on those counterclaims — a ruling that represents the most significant legal development since a U.K. judge rejected Depp's lawsuit against a British tabloid. The November ruling that Heard's tale of being physically assaulted was ""substantially true"" has wounded Depp's career. Although Depp can't now prevail on his anti-SLAPP motion (more on that in a moment), he does at least succeed in paring Heard's countersuit. Heard can't pursue a declaratory judgment of being immune over statements in the op/ed as the Virginia judge deems this claim to be duplicative of her defense to Depp's own suit and not worthy of jurisdiction. And the actress loses her claim over the alleged smear campaign on social media. The judge rules that Heard hasn't sufficiently alleged the elements of a computer crime, in particular communication of obscene language.

But Depp will continue to face her $100 million claim over statements made by Waldman to the Daily Mail in 2020. (Prior statements are deemed outside the statute of limitations.) White says that Depp isn't entitled to anti-SLAPP immunity because he hasn't shown the statements to be matters on public concern. (Never mind the amount of attention this case has drawn.) Even otherwise, the judge adds that Heard has alleged sufficient facts to carry forward her defamation claims, specifically ""that Mr. Depp may have made these statements with actual or constructive knowledge or with reckless disregard for whether they are false."" The judge provides more detail in another section of the opinion. White concludes that the ""hoax"" statements ""imply that Ms. Heard lied and perjured herself when she appeared before a court in 2016 to obtain a temporary restraining order against Mr. Depp. Moreover, they imply that she has lied about being a victim of domestic violence. In light of the #MeToo Movement and today's social climate, falsely claiming abuse would surely 'injure [Ms. Heard's] reputation in the common estimation of mankind.'""",['Eriq Gardner'],https://news.google.com,high
Danish cartoon about man with superlong penis enrages parents,"It’s a show about overcoming life’s most intractable — albeit bizarre — obstacles, really.

Denmark’s John Dillermand is a claymation cartoon man who, like anyone else, enjoys grilling, taking walks around town and eating ice cream. But some of those activities can be difficult for a man with a comically long schlong.

The new children’s show, launching on Danish public television network DR, is aimed at entertaining 4- to 8-year-olds, who producers think will get a kick out of watching the perils of having a protracted penis.

The show’s creator, Jacob Ley, a father of two young girls and a boy, claimed the show is about removing “shame” and “embarrassment” when it came to our bodies, without sexualization. However, Denmark’s conservative crusaders have criticized the concept, the Guardian reported.

“What in the world are you up to, DR Ramasjang!” wrote one parent on Facebook, referring to DR’s kid-centric network Ramasjang. “As a parent, I am mildly shaken and shocked by the line you are currently choosing. I am deeply outraged and think it is SO perverse and inappropriate television for young children. This is the last time I let my children see Ramasjang!”

Christian Groes, gender researcher at Roskilde University, echoed the denunciation with academic insight.

“It’s perpetuating the standard idea of a patriarchal society and normalizing ‘locker room culture’ … that’s been used to excuse a lot of bad behavior from men. It’s meant to be funny — so it’s seen as harmless,” said Groes. “But it’s not. And we’re teaching this to our kids.”

Family psychologist Erla Heinesen Højsted disagreed with the outcry: “John Dillermand talks to children and shares their way of thinking — and kids do find genitals funny,” she told the Guardian.

“The show depicts a man who is impulsive and not always in control, who makes mistakes — like kids do, but crucially, Dillermand always makes it right,” Højsted continued. “He takes responsibility for his actions. When a woman in the show tells him that he should keep his penis in his pants, for instance, he listens. Which is nice. He is accountable.”

She agreed that animators would do well to consider more “difference and diversity” in terms of body types, rather than just an outsized diller — Danish slang for penis. “But this is categorically not a show about sex. To pretend it is projects adult ideas on it,” she said.

DR responded to “John Dillermand’s” detractors by arguing that a show “about a woman with no control over her vagina” could have been just as entertaining, which they said was their only goal for the show — to make kids laugh.",['January'],https://news.google.com,high

When I’ll Likely Come Back to Walt Disney World – An International Perspective,"Twenty-two months. That's how long it's been since I've set foot on Walt Disney World property. This is the longest it’s been since I’ve been in a Disney theme park in twenty years. I know I am only one of the thousands around the world who lost out on another visit to the most magical place on earth due to COVID-19 but as an international guest, I’m also in a slightly different monorail car than my American friends.

What is universal, I’m sure, is my desire to get back to the parks as soon as I can. That being said, being an international traveler to Central Florida makes a trip back a bit more of a challenge during the pandemic but even so, what will it take to get me back? What does the world have to look like? What will be happening in the parks? What are the financial considerations I now have to think about? The questions abound as my wife and I think about taking our young family down to Walt Disney World for another exciting, yet different, vacation.

After some deep thought and conversation with my much better half, here is what it will take to get us - international Disney fans - to come back into the parks.

Completion of Mass Vaccinations

I have the privilege of living in Canada. When the pandemic struck, the powers that be rightly shut down the borders to travel between our two countries. This has made it nearly impossible to get into the United States let alone get to Orlando. If my wife and I lived in the U.S. and it was just us traveling, we would likely have made the trek to Disney at some point. That's just not the situation, though. We have a young family facing a world with a highly contagious virus. But, hope and action are upon us!

We now live in a world with multiple, highly effective vaccines. The U.S. and Canada are both vaccinating our populations and the borders may reopen in the Spring as vaccination numbers increase. While this is a reason to celebrate, there is not a chance we would travel again internationally until both countries reach a critical mass of vaccinations.

This means at least 80% of our residents receive the vaccine. You might think, well, what if you get the vaccine? You should be fine. That may be true but even with an extremely high efficacy for most of the approved vaccines, I don’t want to take an early chance that we may contract the virus or bring it back home to infect a family member even if we don't get sick. Having a higher vaccinated population will make me feel better popping down without fearing what could happen.

Return to the Vast Majority of Pre-COVID Operations

There is no doubt that given everything I’ve seen on social media over the past six months that Disney has put a number of measures in place to get the parks open and try to keep guests safe. This has meant temporarily shuttering some restaurants, altering ride vehicles, and vastly increasing the size of lines to accommodate physical distancing recommendations. What I’ve seen has been impressive but it isn’t necessarily providing the experience my family would be looking for when we head off on a vacation.

The character parades are nice, especially given general COVID-19 health and safety restrictions, but don't offer an ideal experience for young children wanting to meet their favorite characters.

Before calling up a travel agent to book a trip, I will need to be assured that operations, attractions, and ride experiences are similar to pre-COVID times. I will be the first to say that this is a bit of a flexible point given we aren’t quite sure what a post-COVID world will look like from a health and safety perspective, but as I hear more and more that Disney is loosening restrictions and the Florida government is giving theme parks a wide birth around self-regulating, I can’t imagine operations will remain very restrictive in the long-term.

I also want to quickly note here too that I hope/expect Disney to hire back the countless cast members who were laid off during the pandemic. Servers, street entertainers, characters, and more are all integral to the magical experience that is a Walt Disney World trip. Without them, something will be forever lost and will compound on Disney’s bottom line down the road, no matter if management thinks otherwise.

Only a Moderate Cost Inflation

The pandemic has been financially devastating for so many families. My family has been truly lucky to have weathered the pandemic without significant damage to our expenses or long-term savings. This, however, does not mean we will live in the same financial world that we did pre-COVID.

Traveling thousands of miles adds its own costs. Will airlines be increasing costs to cover their recent losses? Should we as a family think about doing a road trip in the car with two boys under six years old for 26 hours? Will Disney increase prices across the board? Will they try to cater to those international travelers like me to get foot traffic back in the parks? Do they even need to incentivize guests to return due to pent up demand? These are just a few of the financial questions that will influence the cost of a Disney trip for international travelers.

We are happy to pay a little more, especially given the trauma of the past year, I think we are willing to shell out something extra for a trip. We love Walt Disney World but even that love and connection is tested if the price is simply too high.

Easing of the Mask Policy

Disney has maintained a reasonable mask policy since opening back in the summer. On most accounts, it is being rightly enforced (I know, I know, not everyone wears them properly, nor 100% of the time) and people are doing their part to stop the spread of the virus.

I have gladly worn a mask since the pandemic began. A mask has been on my face when shopping, visiting friends and colleagues, and when distancing is simply a challenge. My oldest son has even done the same for school and when we go out together and he’s only 5 years old.

The challenge has been our youngest son. The mask policy extends to those two years old and up, which is not easy. At two, wearing a mask just isn’t an option for most. He wears it for three seconds and then takes it off. You can’t reason with him, nor force him through sheer will because he’s, well, two. We cannot travel down there to have the family barred from the parks because our youngest isn’t willing to wear a mask.

It’s too big of a risk and easing the policy to either raise the minimum age or get rid of the policy, in general, is likely the only way to get my family back in the parks.

Assessing Crowd Sizes

I have done hours and hours of research on when and how to tackle Walt Disney World. From consulting the DISboards to watching video after video of tips and even leveraging the power of traffic charts, I used to be able to gauge when the best times were to travel down to the parks. And, it worked.

The majority of our trips to Walt Disney World were not at peak times and offered a good experience for the whole family when it came to lines and crowding. I think most of that research is now in question (the holiday season and Spring Break aside).

We are not locals. A lot of planning is needed for an international trip and with thousands of dollars on the line we don’t want to run the risk of traveling down 6 months after booking to find the parks and resorts super busy and cast members run ragged. I know it’s a risk any guest must expect, but it’s one I’ve sought to mitigate over the years and have done so successfully. Factor in 2021 hosting many 50th anniversary celebrations, the crowds will definitely be high. We will likely wait until we see what crowd sizes are like before we start the booking process.

The unfortunate truth is that all of these factors mean our next family trip from Canada to Walt Disney World likely will not take place until some time in mid-2022. I know the decision-making process is unique for everyone, and I hold no judgment on the choices anyone makes in planning your next Disney trip, but I wanted to share what it’s been like as I start the process of planning my family’s next Disney trip. There is no doubt that there will be a next trip for my family, and that it will be filled with priceless memories, it just won’t be right away.",['David Tubbs'],https://news.google.com,high
Alabama Crimson Tide WR DeVonta Smith says focus is on Ohio State Buckeyes after winning Heisman Trophy,"Check out the highlights of DeVonta Smith's Heisman campaign at Alabama. (1:55)

Alabama wide receiver DeVonta Smith and offensive coordinator Steve Sarkisian did their best to keep the focus off their own career-defining moments as they prepare for Monday's matchup with Ohio State in the College Football Playoff National Championship.

Smith on Wednesday chose not to revel in becoming the first wide receiver to win the Heisman Trophy since 1991. He said that he went home after Tuesday's virtual ceremony and ""went straight to sleep.""

""Last night was a great feeling,"" Smith said. ""It was just a blessing to be in that situation with [quarterback Mac Jones and coach Nick Saban]. But now that's in the past, and now it's on to Ohio State.""

Smith, who led the nation in receptions, receiving yards and receiving touchdowns, will likely be matched up against Ohio State All-America cornerback Shaun Wade in Monday's championship game (8 p.m. ET, ESPN).

Smith called Wade a ""crafty"" player who is ""a technician with everything he does.""

""I'm just looking forward to my last game,"" Smith said. ""I'm only guaranteed this last one, so I'm looking forward to getting to play against him.""

Smith is Mel Kiper's fourth-best prospect in the 2021 NFL draft and his No. 1-ranked receiver.

Sarkisian, who will become the next head coach of the Texas Longhorns after Monday's title game, said ""clearly I'm excited about the opportunity"" that awaits him in Austin. However, he asked Wednesday that any questions pertain to his remaining duties with the Crimson Tide.

Sarkisian, who was previously a head coach at Washington (2009 to 2013) and USC (2014 to 2015), has been Alabama's offensive coordinator the past two seasons.

""The commitment I made to Coach Saban two years ago is the same commitment I've made to these players, and that's focusing on this game,"" Sarkisian said. ""Giving this game the attention that it deserves so our players have an opportunity to go out and play to the best of their abilities.""

Sarkisian said he's trying to keep this week as normal as possible.

""Any of the spare time that I do have, that's getting my attention for the job at Texas, whether that's staffing or recruiting, things of that nature,"" he said.

Sarkisian said Alabama receiver and return specialist Jaylen Waddle, who went down with an ankle injury against Tennessee in mid-October and hasn't appeared in a game since, practiced Tuesday. Sarkisian wouldn't provide any updates beyond that.

""We'll see where it goes from here,"" Sarkisian said.

Before his injury, Waddle caught 25 passes and four touchdowns. As a return specialist, he has averaged 19.3 yards on punt returns during his three seasons.

Smith said Waddle looked good in practice, but he offered only a brief answer when asked whether he believed his teammate would be able to play.

LeBron James wants to buy WNBA team from Kelly Loeffler after Senate loss,"Kelly Loeffler lost her Georgia Senate runoff on Tuesday — and now LeBron James wants to take away her WNBA team, too.

Loeffler, who lost the special election to Rev. Raphael Warnock on Tuesday night, is the co-owner of the Atlanta Dream WNBA team. Her presence in the socially progressive league has been wildly controversial — she has publicly opposed the Black Lives Matter movement and protests against police brutality, even feuding with her own players on the subject.

Jumping at the first opportunity, the Lakers star took a shot at the outgoing senator.

“Think I’m gone put together an ownership group for the The Dream. Whose in? #BlackVotesMatter,” Jame tweeted early Wednesday.

Players have called on multiple occasions for Loeffler to sell the team, and Dream players campaigned against her, photographing themselves in “Vote Warnock” shirts during the 2020 WNBA bubble over the summer. LeBron included the photo in his tweet.

Despite the tweet, there’s no indication that Loeffler has any interest in selling the team, and has resisted all calls to do so in the past.",['January'],https://news.google.com,high
Kevin Stefanski acknowledges he and others missing Steelers game because of COVID-19 ‘is frustrating’ but ‘we have to find a way’,"CLEVELAND, Ohio -- Browns coach Kevin Stefanski said the team must pull together and try to go beat the Steelers Sunday night despite him and four others sitting out the game because of COVID-19.

“We have to find a way,’' Stefanski said.

Sitting in front of a framed print of Jim Brown facing the Steelers, he said he’s disappointed for everybody who can’t be at the Wildcard game Sunday night, including the Browns longest-tenured player in Joel Bitonio.

But he said the players are well-prepared and will know what’s expected of them. He will continue to hammer home the message of doing their job and winning the next game.

“The guys understand what I’m about, they understand what we’re about,’' Stefanski said. “That will continue to be the message.’'

He said the Browns have had no new positives today but that they’ll keep the building closed and continue to work remotely, including a 1 p.m. virtual walk-through. The NFL and it’s partners are continuing to conduct contact tracing to make sure the building is safe from virus transmission before they open back up.

Steelers coach Mike Tomlin also said that no one in the Steelers organization was identified as a close contact after losing to the Browns 24-22 on Sunday. He and Stefanski, who worked together in Minnesota, had a brief encounter on the field.

Stefanski acknowledged that offensive coordinator Alex Van Pelt will call the plays, and that he’s been a huge part of the gameplanning all season.

“He knows the things we believe in,’' he said. “He knows how we play.’'

Stefanski acknowledged “it’s frustrating’' that the team finds itself with a COVID-19 situation because ‘we tried to go above and beyond and will continue to do that.’'

He said he’s fine and his family is fine, and he’s mostly worried about everyone else. He deflected most questions away from his own situation, which is consistent with his demeanor all season. He’s been asymptomatic to this point and seemed fine on the Zoom call.

He said he chose Mike Priefer as interim coach because as special teams coordinator he’s involved with so many players and aspects of the game. He noted that he ‘did a great job’ when he subbed for Mike Zimmer in a 17-15 loss to the Cowboys in 2016 when Zimmer underwent emergency eye surgery.

He insisted that the team ‘is not in my image’ and that they’ll be fine without him on Sunday in the club’s first playoff game in 18 years.

A play that looked relatively simple on the television broadcast was anything but, at least from the quarterback’s point of view before the snap.

Asked about the play, Rodgers pointed out the pre-snap confusion between Robert Quinn and Danny Trevathan, his thought process on the likelihood of a blitz coming based on the coverage, and why he knew post-snap that Valdes-Scantling would be wide open.

All the information was acquired during the 20 seconds or so after the Packers broke the huddle and got to the line of scrimmage. Rodgers used the entire playclock to figure out the protection, adjust the play slightly and figure out the coverage, so when the ball was snapped, he had the opportunity to create a big play.

“I could tell there was something a little messed up on defense,” Rodgers said, describing the confusion over where Quinn would line up before the snap.

Rodgers said he knew at the snap, based on the pre-snap look, that Valdes-Scantling would have a linebacker in coverage, so all he had to do was wait long enough – even against a backside blitz he figured was coming – for Valdes-Scantling to clear on the vertical route.

“Just tried to beat the defender blitzing with the throw, and MVS did a really nice job of just running straight and catching the ball above of his eyes, that was a good play for us,” Rodgers told McAfee.

Valdes-Scantling easily beat Trevathan down the field and Rodgers hit him in stride, and without a deep safety over the top to help, the Packers receiver coasted into the end zone for a 72-yard score.

The touchdown – which came on third down, no less – gave the Packers a 14-10 lead in the second quarter. Matt LaFleur’s team wouldn’t trail again.","['Zach Kruse', 'Jack Wepfer', 'Joe Kipp', 'Brandon Carwile']",https://news.google.com,high
Nick Saban's daughter Kristen shares Ohio State conspiracy theory,"Think before you tweet

Fresh off a blowout win against Clemson in last week’s Sugar Bowl, Ohio State has found itself with an issue more pressing than an upcoming date with Alabama: The Buckeyes are experiencing a COVID-19 outbreak that could leave them with an entire position group unavailable and perhaps even force next Monday's National Championship to be postponed, AL.com’s John Talty and Matt Zenitz reported on Tuesday. The CFP has booked Miami’s Hard Rock Stadium for Jan. 18 as a backup date, although there has not been a final decision on whether to bump the game back a week, according to the report. (CFP executive director Bill Hancock and Ohio State athletic director Gene Smith told ESPN that the game will not be moved from its original Jan. 11 date.)

Of course, some fans inevitably took the news as evidence of a conspiracy; this is the world of college football, after all. But somebody with a little more responsibility than a Twitter egg joined the chorus of Crimson Tide supporters alleging shenanigans.

Alabama coach Nick Saban’s daughter, Kristen, tweeted on Tuesday afternoon that Ohio State’s coronavirus cases are a smoke screen designed to get the game pushed back so that quarterback Justin Fields, who injured his ribs on a nasty hit against Clemson, can rest up and be at full strength when the title game is played.

The younger Saban set her account to private before posting an apology three hours later. “I made a huge mistake and I apologize,” she added. “In a moment of frustration, I let my anger get the best of me and acted before thinking.”

When someone makes a bad tweet, their actions can sometimes tell you just how bad it was. If they leave the post up and don’t follow up on it, maybe it wasn’t so awful. But, this was pretty bad! How do I know? Well, Saban ended up going through all five stages of social media controversy:

Delete the tweet. Set your account to private. Post an apology. Delete your account. Delete your other social media accounts.

Hopefully Saban learned a few lessons here that are applicable to any person these days. First of all, think before you tweet. Second, don’t be a conspiracy monger during a pandemic. And most importantly, don’t give college football fans a reason to be mad at you. They’re already mad enough at everybody.

Patriots’ Cam Newton Won’t Wait To Sign,"Cam Newton is on track for free agency in the spring. This time around, the Patriots quarterback tells Greg Hill of WEEI that he doesn’t want to wait until the summer to sign a deal.

“That’s definitely going to go into consideration,” Newton said (Twitter link via ESPN.com’s Mike Reiss). “I’m not going to wait in the latter part of another season when I have the opportunity to do something or sign with someone.”

Though no decision has been made, the Patriots are not expected to re-sign Newton. Newton threw for just five touchdowns against ten interceptions, resulting in an NFL-low 78.9 quarterback rating. The Patriots expected more from the former MVP, and they missed the playoffs for the first time in a long time.

Newton may still hold appeal for other teams, given his potential and the dearth of talent at the QB position. Plus, he’s shown he can still be effective with his feet, having rushed 126 times for 513 yards (4.1 YPC average) and 12 TDs. He also stayed healthy – no small feat, given his pre-Patriots history.

No matter where he lands, the 31-year-old has every intention of starting.

“If you are asking me, Do I want to be a backup? Hell no!,” Newton said. “When I look at other teams, and I’m looking at other players play, there have been guys that have been getting away with murder for years because of subpar play. Do I have the right to say that with the year I had this year? No. But I’m going to be honest and say it because that’s what I do.”

John Mara: Why Dave Gettleman is coming back as Giants GM,"There was no formal announcement by the Giants or co-owner John Mara on Wednesday relaying that Dave Gettleman is coming back as general manager.

Asked about this, Mara smiled and said, “Well, he is coming back, if you want a formal announcement about that.’’

It clearly was not something weighing on Mara’s mind, whether he needed to move on from Gettleman. The reason for the return is not based wholly on the performance of the team – the Giants this season finished 6-10 and, once again, did not make the playoffs – but rather on the way Gettleman and Joe Judge, the first-year head coach, worked as allies in their first year together.

“He and Dave worked very well together,” Mara said. “All of our personnel decisions I thought improved significantly this year. They were able to agree on basically every decision we made. I thought our draft was solid, our free agency moves were solid and I think we have the foundation for something that can be very successful going forward.”

Gettleman, who turns 70 next month, went 9-23 in his first two years running the entire football operation. There is no change to the structure of how the organization goes about finding and procuring players.

“The general manager and the head coach collaborate on personnel decisions,” Mara said. “Hey haven’t agreed 100 percent of the time but my father [franchise patriarch Wellington Mara] used to have a saying, ‘If you both agree all the time then I don’t need both of you.’ I haven’t had to intercede on one occasion to break any ties.

“They managed to talk it through and work it out, showed good communication and at the end of the day the decision that gets made is a New York Giants decision, it’s not Joe’s decision or Dave’s decision. They collaborated really well and that’s one of the reasons why I’m optimistic about our future.

“I just didn’t think making a change at this point in time was something that was going to be beneficial.”

Mara lauded the job Judge did in his first year as a head coach at any level. The Giants started out 0-5 and were 1-7 at midseason but rallied to go 5-3 in the second half of the season.

“Looking back a year ago I can tell you we’re very pleased with the selection we made at head coach,” Mara said. “I thought Joe did a very good job, considering what he had to deal with.

“Here you have a brand new head coach at 38 years of age and look what he was asked to deal with, a pandemic, no offseason program, no mini-camps, no preseason games, virtual meetings, protocols that kept changing and he loses his best player [Saquon Barkley] in Week 2. I thought he showed great leadership and great adaptability, nothing seemed to faze him during the year. Something has to change he just made the change and we went from there. I thought he showed real leadership and grit and determination the entire time. I thought he represented our franchise very well, the way I want our head coach to represent our franchise.

Dave Gettleman and John Mara Robert Sabo

“I thought he established a great foundation and a great culture, I know that ‘culture’ word is overused but I think it’s so important and I think we have the beginnings of a very good culture here.’’

The record and missing out on the playoffs after finishing in second place in the historically bad NFC East were not acceptable, Mara, said, but he saw signs that the franchise is moving in the right direction.

“Obviously I’m not pleased with the number of games we won,’’ Mara said. “I’m disappointed we didn’t do better than 6-10 but I do see progress in the building. I think the quality of the people we have in the locker room improved a great deal. I think we have some great leaders down there. I think we’ve established a basis for a foundation that can have continued success going forward and I’m excited about what the future holds for this team.’’

Mara said, “There’s a different feeling in the building now that there has been in a number of years.’’

Mara was asked how long the fans have to wait for the Giants to produce a winning team.

“Well, hopefully not too much longer because I can’t wait too much longer, quite frankly. I’m tired of sitting up here at the end of the year trying to explain what went wrong and why I feel optimistic about the future,” Mara said. “I want to do it after a winning season.’’",['January'],https://news.google.com,high

Gov. Cuomo will not attend Buffalo Bills playoff game,"Gov. Andrew Cuomo said on Wednesday that he will not be attending the Buffalo Bills playoff game on Saturday in Orchard Park, N.Y. because he needs to stay in Albany to work on his State of the State address.

The news comes just days after Bills fans started a petition calling to ban Cuomo from attending the game. The petition, which was created because the creator felt Cuomo shouldn’t attend because of his political stance for the previous eight home games, has yielded over 35,000 signatures.

“So Cuomo is going to attend our playoff game after telling us that we can only attend at less than 10% capacity?” petition creator Jeffrey Dorenzo wrote. “If he thinks he has more right to a seat in that stadium over people who have waited over 20 years for this opportunity, then people better be there to protest his entry. This is OUR team! This is OUR home. We don’t want you here.”

Cuomo ultimately won’t be in attendance and instead will give his ticket to an ECMA nurse.

Report: Detroit Pistons rookie Killian Hayes suffers torn hip labrum,"News of Detroit Pistons rookie Killian Hayes’ injury is not what the team had hoped. The No. 7 overall pick in last year’s NBA draft has torn the labrum in his right hip, according to The Athletic’s Shams Charania.

Hayes suffered the injury in the third quarter of Monday’s loss to the Milwaukee Bucks. He was stripped by Bucks guard Jrue Holiday and fell awkwardly underneath the basket unsuccessfully defending in transition.

Oh no. Killian Hayes is down and holding his thigh. Had a bit of an awkward fall trying to defend this fast break. #Pistons pic.twitter.com/CUGGCDOL2O — Jonathan Deutsch (@JonathanD_TV) January 5, 2021

Hayes, Detroit’s starting point guard, left the seventh game of his career after just 13:24 of game action. The promising 19-year-old French floor general was averaging 4.6 points and 3.6 assists in 21.1 minutes a night.

Video appeared to show Hayes telling trainers he felt a “pop” as they attended to him on the floor. Detroit coach Dwane Casey offered some optimism in the aftermath of Monday’s 125-115 loss, telling reporters, “They thought it was the hip flexor, but they weren’t sure.” An MRI on Hayes’ hip was scheduled for Tuesday, when the Pistons listed him as doubtful with the injury for Wednesday’s rematch with the Bucks.

The injury is a devastating blow for the Pistons, whose 1-6 record ranks them last in the NBA. The history of hip labrum tears is not encouraging, especially for point guards. The injury directly led to career downfalls of former No. 6 overall pick Jonny Flynn at age 21 and All-NBA star Isaiah Thomas at age 28. All Detroit can do is hope the young Hayes can still reach his potential following what is expected to be a lengthy recovery.

Jets Interview Chiefs OC Eric Bieniemy for Head Coaching Vacancy,"The Jets have interviewed Chiefs offensive coordinator Eric Bieniemy for their head coaching vacancy.

Bienemy has been coaching with Kansas City since 2013. He started as a running backs coach before he was promoted to OC before the 2018 season. The Chiefs led the NFL in total offense (303.4 yds/g) and passing offense (303.4) in the 2020 season while earning the AFC's No. 1 seed with a 14-2 record. KC also ranked No. 6 in the NFL in points scored per game (29.6).

In each of his three seasons as offensive coordinator, Bienemy has orchestrated an offense that's finished no worse than sixth in the NFL in total yards per game and points per game. KC has a 38-10 record since he was named OC.

A running backs coach at UCLA from 2003-5, Bieniemy served in the same capacity for the Vikings (2006-10) and the Chiefs (2013-17). In between those two stints, Bieniemy was Colorado's offensive coordinator in 2011-12.

The fixable problems facing the Miami Heat and Boston Celtics early this NBA season,"It has been 100 days since the Miami Heat beat the Boston Celtics in Game 6 of the 2020 Eastern Conference finals inside the NBA's bubble at the Walt Disney World Resort.

Both teams entered the 2020-21 season with aspirations of getting at least that far again, but as they meet Wednesday for the first time this season (7:30 p.m. ET on ESPN and the ESPN App), they both are still rounding into form.

The Celtics are 5-3, thanks almost solely to the stellar play of Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown, who both look like surefire All-Stars this season. Miami, meanwhile, enters Wednesday's game at 3-3, and has had one of the league's worst offenses.

Despite the up-and-down start, both teams can take solace in the fact that the season is just two weeks old. ESPN's BPI still projects both the Celtics and Heat to finish in the top five of the Eastern Conference, right where they were a season ago. However, if the early returns mean anything, both teams remain very much a work in progress.

With Gordon Hayward now in Charlotte, having left Boston as a free agent, and Kemba Walker laid up as he continues to strengthen his ailing left knee, the Celtics look a lot different than they did at the start of last season. With that has come some growing pains.

""This is what I anticipated,"" Celtics coach Brad Stevens said Saturday. ""We've got a lot of questions to answer. There's a lot of new, a lot of people playing new roles, new responsibilities, [and there's] new pressures that come with that.""

With Walker sidelined, Boston entered the season needing someone to pick up the scoring slack behind the team's star young wing tandem.

So far, no one has.

While Brown (26.9 points per game) and Tatum (26.3) are off to strong starts, Marcus Smart (12.6) is the only other player on the team averaging over 10 points per game. Boston's current preferred starting lineup -- Smart, Brown, Tatum, Daniel Theis and Tristan Thompson -- has been outscored by over 16 points per 100 possessions in 74 minutes, per NBA.com's stats page, by far the worst of any lineup that has played that many minutes this season.

It has predictably struggled offensively (101.9 points per 100 possessions) while providing none of the defensive heft (118 points per 100 possessions) it was designed for.

""I was hopeful that lineup would be very good defensively,"" Stevens said. ""I'm still hopeful of that.""

The Celtics haven't been able to turn to their bench for instant offense either. Veteran backup point guard Jeff Teague has started the season hot from 3-point range (7-for-12, though he's taken only seven since going 4-for-5 in Boston's opener), but is shooting an abysmal 9-for-36 on 2s and now has a sprained ankle. Young center Robert Williams III is shooting 75% from the field, which also happens to be the same percentage of his 28 shots that have come at the rim. Rookie Payton Pritchard has proved his draft report to be correct as a quality long-range shooter, but his inexperience as a creator has led to him being used most frequently alongside Teague, playing off the ball.

Still, Pritchard's play, including his 23 points and eight assists in 32 minutes off the bench in Monday's emphatic victory over the Toronto Raptors, has become a critical factor for a Boston team that still isn't whole.

""They're missing an All-Star point guard,"" said one scout, ""and a rather thin bench has gotten thinner and even more unproven.""

Some of these issues will be alleviated when Walker returns, though his timeline remains uncertain. Until then, the Celtics find themselves relying on superlative performances from both Brown and Tatum every game to have enough scoring to win, a burden that will only grow heavier as this compacted season wears on.

Tatum, who made his first All-Star appearance a year ago, is shooting over 40% from beyond the arc and has established himself as Boston's go-to player in the clutch. He already has two go-ahead baskets in the final three seconds of games this season, after making one over his first three NBA seasons combined.

Brown, meanwhile, has established himself as an early-season favorite for Most Improved Player. He is shooting 58.1% from the field -- fourth best in the league among players taking at least 10 shots per game -- and a career-high 42.9% from 3, all while fully embracing the much larger load that's been placed upon his shoulders because of Walker's injury and Hayward's departure.

Nevertheless, Brown knows it's not enough to do that for eight games -- at least not if Brown wants to return to the conference finals for the fourth time in his five-year career.

""It's not about if you can do it once, it's what you can do over and over and over again,"" Brown said. ""It's about being consistent, so, keep continuing to make the effort. Continuing to adjust is going to be key for us. I think we'll be fine down the line.""

The Heat heard throughout the NBA's restart last season how their organizational culture made them the perfect team for the bubble, and they proved that talk right by reaching the NBA Finals for the first time since LeBron James left six years ago.

But as the 2020-21 season began with teams back in home markets, many around the league wondered if Miami would ride its momentum or prove to be just a bubble fluke.

""I thought it was a situational overachievement,"" another scout said. ""They were not that good. [Jimmy] Butler played out of his mind, [Tyler] Herro played out of his mind, they were all kumbaya, but they were not quite that good. I thought they maximized whatever they were going to maximize.""

So far, however, the Heat's problems have been less about where they're playing and more about who they're putting on the court.

The loss of Jae Crowder -- who signed a three-year deal with the Phoenix Suns -- has been noticeable. Crowder connected on 56% of his 3s in the seeding games and 40% in the first two rounds of the playoffs, allowing Miami to effectively space the floor around Bam Adebayo inside.

The Heat have tried to fill that hole with Maurice Harkless (who is attempting less than one 3-pointer per game this season, and making just 25%), Meyers Leonard (who played just 31 minutes in the 2020 playoffs after starting 49 regular-season games) and Andre Iguodala (who at 37 years old is shooting a career-low 30% from the field, and has missed all five shots he's taken inside the 3-point arc).

Things finally began to click Monday in a blowout win over Oklahoma City when the Heat turned to Kelly Olynyk, who posted 19 points and eight rebounds. While the Thunder rank as one of the league's worst teams, it still marked a vast improvement over what Miami was getting previously at the power forward spot.

And the Heat, who currently rank 26th in the NBA in offensive efficiency, need all the production they can get.

""The way we execute and the way our offense flows and makes reads, it does take a little bit of time,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. ""We're not just running a spread pick-and-roll with Jimmy [Butler] every single time. ... With a short turnaround, I anticipated there would be an adjustment. I hope there's not a long adjustment with this.""

Butler, meanwhile, has been banged up to start the season, missing two games and a large part of a third with a sprained ankle, and is averaging only 10.8 points per game. Still, several scouts and executives said they had no worries about Butler returning to form, pointing to his injury and heavy workload in the bubble as obvious reasons behind his slow start.

The Big Face Coffee proprietor thrived in the postseason playing alongside Goran Dragic, who has returned to a bench role after starting during most of the 2020 playoffs. Currently Miami is starting second-year guard Tyler Herro next to Duncan Robinson in the backcourt to get a sense of how effective that tandem can be long-term. Dragic is playing less than 24 minutes a night off the bench, but as he showed in last season's playoffs, the 34-year-old is capable of carrying a heavier load when Miami needs him to.

For now, while the season remains young, the Heat will continue to experiment.

""I think you're seeing throughout the league, even with teams that brought back the majority of their players ... the first month of the season, you're trying to figure it out,"" Iguodala said. ""I think we're just working through it, trying to be smart about it. We've got a lot of depth, so a lot of moving parts, depending on the game.""

There have been some successes. Miami has immediately put rookie big man Precious Achiuwa into its rotation, slotting him in as Adebayo's backup. He's shooting 64% from the field on a steady diet of shots at the rim, a role similar to the one Montrezl Harrell parlayed into Sixth Man of the Year honors for the LA Clippers last season. And, on Miami's first offensive play of the season, Herro and Adebayo ran a pick-and-roll that finished off with an Adebayo dunk, a chemistry that they've continued to show over Miami's first few games.

""We're not going to figure this out in two days,"" Adebayo said last week. ""Coach is doing the best job he can to figure the lineup out, but also make sure our offense is flowing and is doing what it's supposed to do. We're going to be all right.""","['Tim Bontemps', 'Eric Woodyard', 'Ohm Youngmisuk', 'Adrian Wojnarowski', 'Malika Andrews', 'André Snellings', 'Eric Karabell', 'Baxter Holmes', 'Andrew Lopez']",https://news.google.com,high
Breaking: Gators land DT transfer Antonio Shelton,"Swamp247 has been reporting for weeks that the Florida Gators would be active with remaining spots in the NCAA Transfer Portal. The defensive line spot, notably the interior part of the defensive line have been an area of focus in the portal for the Orange and Blue. The Gators made their first step of adding some depth to the defensive tackle position with the addition of former Penn State Nittany Lions defensive tackle Antonio Shelton.

He announced his departure from the Nittany Lions on December 23rd. Michigan, Florida State, Illinois, and Arizona State are some other teams that had reportedly shown interest as well in Shelton. In his four years playing at Penn State, Shelton accounted for 51 total tackles, and 6 sacks. Shelton is expected to be a graduate transfer with one year left to play at the college level instead of testing the NFL waters. He made seven starts for the Nittany Lions in 2020, started 12 games in 2019, and 1 start in 2018.

The addition of this 6-foot-2, 327-pounder comes at an ideal time for the Gators defense. The Gators will see the departure of starting defensive tackles Tedarrell Slaton and Kyree Campbell after this season, and will have a majority of youth on the roster at the interior part of the defensive line. With the addition of Shelton, the Gators will have some experience added to their defensive tackle room to go along with names like Gervon Dexter and Jalen Lee, who saw some snaps in 2020. The Gators recently saw starting defensive end Zachary Carter announce his intentions to return to the team for his final year of college football next season after deciding not to test NFL Draft waters.

Some other names the Gators have made contact with in the NCAA Transfer Portal at some point include former former Florida State defensive lineman Cory Durden, and Clemson defensive lineman Jordan Williams. We also expect Florida to make a play for LSU tight end transfer Arik Gilbert, and Oklahoma wide receiver transfer Charleston Rambo.

Lions247 editor Sean Fitz has covered Shelton as both a high school recruit and player at Penn State and had plenty of good things to say about the type of player the Gators will be adding up front.

""He is one of the strongest players that I have seen come through the program and near the top in terms of bench and strength numbers. He's best suited for holding ups blockers and things like that. Sometimes a penetrator as a pass rusher but not his forte. He is a solid presence in the middle and vocal guy.""

As mentioned, the Gators will have several younger players around Shelton on the defensive line and Fitz also adds that Shelton will be a good name to mesh with the others around him in Gainesville.

""I think anytime you look in the portal to add to your others guys, experience is a premium. He's a guy who started a bunch of games for Penn State and really cane parlay that experience to invaluable lessons around the other guys around him. He has seen a lot, played a lot of football. He's seen different looks and he's got experience that can help on the field and in the film room.""

The 247Sports Composite, an industry generated average, ranked Shelton as the Nation's No. 82 ranked defensive tackle in the 2016 cycle. He signed with Penn State in February of 2016 after committing to the Nittany Lions in January of that year.",[],https://news.google.com,high
"Jaylen Waddle ‘looks good’ at practice, status for title game still TBD","The mystery of Jaylen Waddle’s status reached the practice field Tuesday as Alabama began preparations for Ohio State in the CFP national title game.

The ankle injury that appeared to end his season in October has healed to the point Alabama’s explosive receiver was back on the field six days before kickoff.

“We’ll see where it goes from here,” Alabama offensive coordinator Steve Sarkisian said Wednesday morning. “Clearly we’ve got about a week or so until the game, so probably a better question for Coach Saban, but yes, he was back at practice yesterday.”

Waddle did not appear in the 2-minute, 26-second video Alabama released from its closed practice, but he got good reviews from teammates.

“Of course he’s going to take some time just for him to get back comfortable with everything,” said fellow receiver and Heisman Trophy winner DeVonta Smith, “but he looks good to me.”

And his quarterback?

“Yeah, he actually looked really good,” Mac Jones said, “but I don’t know if I can answer that question properly because you’ve got to ask Coach Saban and the training staff.”

Waddle is No. 3 among Alabama pass catchers in receptions (25) and yards (557) espite missing the final eight games of the season with the ankle injury suffered on the opening kickoff at Tennessee.

AL.com on Monday reported Waddle would be back on the practice field this week and might play next Monday in the title game.

“Waddle has looked good,” said fellow receiver John Metchie. “He’s been doing a lot of treatment. He’s been on top of everything, and I feel like that’s that. Him coming back, as to him coming back, I think everyone knows what he brings and what that brings when he’s on the field to the defense, how they look at that, how dynamic our offense is.”

Giants’ Leonard Williams is NFC Defensive Player of the Week,"New York Giants defensive lineman Leonard Williams finished the best season of his NFL career by being named NFC Defensive Player of the Week for his dominant effort Sunday against the Dallas Cowboys.

Williams had three sacks, five additional pressures, three tackles for loss and six total stops against Dallas, along with a pass defensed in the Giants’ 23-19 victory.

Williams also won the Defensive Player of the Week honor after a 2.5-sack game against the Seattle Seahawks.

The six-year veteran finished with 11.5 sacks, the first double-digit sack season of his career. Williams’ total is the most by a Giant since Jason Pierre-Paul had 14.5 in 2014.

The Giants finished the season with 40 sacks, their highest total since they had 47 in 2014.

Williams is heading to free agency after playing the 2020 season on the franchise tag. Best guess is he will be looking for a contract that will put him in the top 10 among defensive linemen, which means an average annual value of at least $17.5 million.","['Ed Valentine', 'Jan']",https://news.google.com,high
"2021 NFL Mock Draft: Jaguars land Joe Brady, Justin Herbert gets a guru","What would a 2021 NFL Mock Draft of coaches look like?

Imagine for a minute that coaches landed with NFL teams the same way prospects did: through a draft. In this alternate reality, what would a 2021 NFL Mock Draft of coaches look like after the fallout from Black Monday.

After the season’s end, the Jacksonville Jaguars let go of Doug Marrone, The New York Jets parted with Adam Gase, and the Los Angeles Chargers dismissed Anthony Lynn. These three coaches joined the likes of Bill O’Brien, Matt Patricia, and Dan Quinn, who were all fired mid-season by their respective teams.

Using the same order as the 2021 NFL Draft, we draft for the six teams in need of a new head coach in this coaches mock draft.

1. Jacksonville Jaguars: Joe Brady, OC, Carolina Panthers

Did the Jaguars reach with the first overall pick here? There is potential, however, just like college prospects, coaches with high ceilings will be pushed up the board. Joe Brady, the offensive coordinator of the Carolina Panthers, burst onto the scene in 2019 after he led the LSU offense to a historic season; he is a large part of the rise of Joe Burrow with the Tigers, leading him to becoming the top pick in the 2020 NFL Draft.

Given the horrid roster Brady was asked to work with, and the limited arm of Teddy Bridgewater, the Panthers’ offense managed to post more points than expected. We saw the rise of Curtis Samuel, Robby Anderson get a real shot away from Adam Gase, and D.J. Moore prove he is deserving of being a first round pick.

Imagine what Brady could do with Clemson quarterback Trevor Lawrence, D.J. Chark, Laviska Shenault, and running back James Robinson. Looking for a resurgence in a small market, the Jaguars make Brady their guy with the top pick.","['Chris Spooner', 'Brandon Coyle']",https://news.google.com,high
liquid glass: a new state of matter uncovered by scientists,"it’s a material that we use every day, but did you know that the physical and chemical properties of glass have long baffled scientists? now, thanks to a team of researchers at the university of konstanz in germany, new light has been shed on the true nature of glass, which despite what you might think, isn’t a typical solid. led by professor andreas zumbusch and professor matthias fuchs, the study has uncovered a new state of matter: liquid glass.

glass is an amorphous solid, meaning that the atoms and molecules display more random arrangements rather than the definite lattice patterns of conventional solids. glass also does not follow the typical transition from liquid to solid, which usually involves molecules lining up to form a crystal pattern. instead, glass molecules are effectively frozen in place before this crystallization can occur (via university of konstanz). it’s this unique transition that the scientists set out to understand. main image by johannes w on unsplash.

to conduct their research, the scientists used a model system of colloidal suspensions. colloidal suspension mixtures contain solid particles bigger than atoms or molecules, making them easier to study. most experiments use spherical colloids however this research used tailor-made ellipsoidal colloids so the team could see whether or not the particles changed orientation.

using different particle concentrations, the researchers observed how much the particles moved and rotated. the experiments revealed that the liquid glass state arises from clusters of particles in the same orientation that block each other from rotating, which would instead result in the more conventional liquid crystal formation. the study marks a significant discovery in the world of chemistry, which had predicted the liquid glass state of matter for 20 years. the study was first published in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences journal and it was authored by jörg roller, aleena laganapan, janne-mieke meijer, matthias fuchs, and andreas zumbusch.

Elon Musk hints next Starship launch could happen in WEEKS amid Mars mission pledge,"SpaceX show the Falcon 9's first stage landing

It comes after photos emerged of two test models of the rocket standing side by side at the rocket company’s launch pad in Boca Chica, USA. SpaceX is currently constructing its 10th test version of Starship – dubbed SN10 – as part of the spacecraft’s ongoing development process.

Trending

Recently, a Twitter user sent a photo of two Starship rockets standing next to one another and asked: “With SN10 nearly complete and repairs being done at the landing pad, do you think this is something we will get to see in the next few weeks?” The user did not clarify what they meant by “this,” but some observers have taken it to refer to a simultaneous launch of two prototypes. Mr Musk responded with a simple “Yes”. He did not elaborate on any concrete date for the next test launch.

Eventually, SpaceX hopes to use Starship for manned missions to Mars, which will be a first for humanity when it is achieved. Meanwhile, the company is also gearing up for a test of its Super Heavy rocket booster, which is what Starship will eventually sit on top of in order to launch it into orbit. The rocket booster will be 240 feet tall and feature 28 Raptor engines in total.

In comparison, SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket – now a workhorse for International Space Station deliveries and satellite launches – makes use of nine engines for its first launch stage, though they are of a different type. Mr Musk said last month he was “highly confident” that SpaceX would launch humans to Mars by 2026, but potentially even earlier “if we get lucky”.

U.S. officials report more severe allergic reactions to COVID-19 vaccines,"FILE PHOTO: Medical staff member receives the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine at Jackson Memorial Hospital in Miami, Florida, U.S., December 15, 2020. REUTERS/Marco Bello

(Reuters) - The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said on Wednesday it is carefully monitoring allergic reactions to the coronavirus vaccines from Pfizer Inc and Moderna Inc and urged individuals who had a serious reaction not to get the second dose.

In a conference call with reporters, the U.S. public health agency said allergic reactions are occurring at a rate of 11.1 per 1 million vaccinations. That compared with flu vaccines, in which such reactions occur at a rate of 1.3 per 1 million shots.

The severe reactions are still “exceedingly rare,” they said, stressing the need for people to get vaccinated when the shots become available to them, given the threat of death and serious disease from the coronavirus that has already claimed more than 357,000 lives in the United States alone.

The CDC said it is monitoring allergic reaction incidents closely and plans to post weekly updates on its website.

The agency is also urging that venues that deliver the vaccine be prepared not only to recognize serious allergic reactions, known as anaphylaxis, but be trained on how to treat them and recognize when individuals need to be referred to hospitals for additional care.

CDC officials said 28 people who received the coronavirus vaccine developed by Pfizer and BioNTech had severe allergic reactions. They also noted one case of anaphylaxis, which can cause throat swelling and breathing difficulty, after an individual received Moderna’s vaccine.

Officials attributed the difference largely to the fact that the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine was authorized earlier than the Moderna shot, and said the precautions apply to both.

A study published on Wednesday in the CDC’s weekly report on death and disease looking at cases between Dec. 14 and Dec. 23, identified 21 cases of anaphylaxis after the administration of 1,893,360 doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine. Of these, 71%occurred within the first 15 minutes after vaccine administration.

Britain’s medical regulator has said that anyone with a history of anaphylaxis, or severe allergic reactions to a medicine or food, should not be given the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine.","['Manas Mishra', 'Julie Steenhuysen']",https://news.google.com,high

Toxin chimeras slip therapeutics into neurons to treat botulism in animals,"Taking advantage of the chemical properties of botulism toxins, two teams of researchers have fashioned non-toxic versions of these compounds that can deliver therapeutic antibodies to treat botulism, a potentially fatal disease with few approved treatments. The research, which was conducted in mice, guinea pigs, and nonhuman primates, suggests that the toxin derivatives could one day offer a platform to quickly treat established cases of botulism and target hard-to-reach molecules within neurons. Botulism manifests due to bacterial toxins called botulinum neurotoxins (BoNTs), which are the most potent toxins known to humans. BoNTs work by entering and damaging neurons that coordinate movement, resulting in paralysis that requires intensive care and can potentially last for months. There is a dire need for therapies that can quickly reverse paralysis, but developing treatments for existing cases has been difficult because it is challenging to neutralize BoNTs with therapeutics once the toxins have entered neurons. In the first study, Shin-Ichiro Miyashita and colleagues fused different sections of two BoNTs named BoNT/X and BoNT/A, resulting in a chimeric molecule that is both non-toxic and works as a drug delivery platform. Specifically, the researchers combined a neuron-targeting domain of BoNT/A with another domain of BoNT/X that can deliver therapeutic molecules into the interior of neurons. Miyashita et al. found that their approach rapidly delivered an antitoxin antibody into neurons and neutralized both the BoNT/A and BoNT/B neurotoxins in mice, reversing paralysis within a few hours. Taking a similar approach, Patrick McNutt and colleagues engineered a non-toxic BoNT derivative that safely neutralized BoNT/A within neurons. Their treatment also alleviated paralysis and boosted survival in mice, guinea pigs, and nonhuman primates exposed to lethal amounts of BoNT/A. ""This platform offers a transformational approach for a precision treatment that might be adapted to diverse presynaptic diseases,"" say McNutt et al.

Shiga toxin's not supposed to kill you,"E. coli food poisoning is one of the worst food poisonings, causing bloody diarrhea and kidney damage. But all the carnage might be just an unintended side effect, researchers from UConn Health report in the 27 November issue of Science Immunology. Their findings might lead to more effective treatments for this potentially deadly disease.

Escherichia coli are a diverse group of bacteria that often live in animal guts. Many types of E. coli never make us sick; other varieties can cause traveler's diarrhea. But swallowing even a few cells of the type of E. coli that makes Shiga toxin can make us very, very ill. Shiga toxin damages blood vessels in the intestines, causing bloody diarrhea. If Shiga toxin gets into the bloodstream it can cause kidney failure.

""This is especially common in children; about 15% of kids with Shiga toxin-producing E. coli infections get kidney disease, and some can suffer long term kidney damage,"" says UConn Health immunologist Sivapriya Vanaja.

A group of Shiga toxin-producing E. coli called enterohemorrhagic E. coli, or EHEC, are especially common in the United States. When you hear that a batch of romaine lettuce is being recalled because of a dangerous outbreak of food poisoning, it's almost certainly due to EHEC.

EHEC normally live in cattle without making them sick. It used to be relatively common to have EHEC outbreaks coming from unhygienically prepared ground meat, but stringent regulations on slaughterhouses have made this less common. Now it's more likely for EHEC to appear on vegetables grown in fields adjacent to cattle or manure runoff.

But no matter where it comes from, once EHEC bacteria get inside a human, the infection is hard to treat. Antibiotics tend to make it worse--when the bacteria feel themselves dying, they make more Shiga toxin. And EHEC are very good at inhibiting the part of the immune system that normally responds early to this kind of infection, allowing them to grow unchecked in the human gut.

In a study led by Morena Havira, a postdoctoral fellow in Vanaja's lab, the team wanted to know how EHEC suppresses the immune system. The body normally responds to early stages of E. coli infections by activating an enzyme that kicks off an alarm inside cells. The cell bursts open to release a cloud of warning molecules that call other parts of the immune system to come and fight the bacteria.

But EHEC squashes that early response. To figure out how it does that, Vanaja and her colleagues decided to see which individual gene in EHEC was responsible. They took many different varieties of EHEC from a bacterial mutant library, and infected immune cells with them.

The team found that cells infected with EHEC that was missing the gene for Shiga toxin mustered a higher immune response compared to normal EHEC.

""It was surprising. Shiga toxin is very well-studied for its toxic activity; it wasn't known that it had another function,"" Dr. Vanaja says. So Shiga toxin's stealthy suppression of the immune system may have a link to all the bloody drama that ensues. Spurred on by this exciting observation, they conducted a series of detailed molecular studies, which revealed that Shiga toxin blocks a protein from bursting open the infected cell and alerting the body of infection.

Now that Vanaja and her colleagues know the specific molecular step Shiga toxin interferes with inside the immune cells, they are trying to figure out how, exactly, it blocks it. Once they know that, they may be able to find medicines that prevent toxin from interfering with immune responses.

Majority of biotech companies completing an IPO from 1997-2016 achieved product approvals,"A large scale study from Bentley University of the biotechnology companies that completed Initial Public Offerings from 1997-2016 estimates that 78% of these companies are associated with products that reach phase 3 trials and 52% are associated with new product approvals. The article, titled ""Late-stage product development and approvals by biotechnology companies after IPO, 1997-2016,"" shows that these emerging, public biotechnology companies continue to have a role in initiating new product development, but are no longer distinctively focused on novel, biological products.

The new report from the Center for Integration of Science and Industry at Bentley University, published in Clinical Therapeutics, studied the 319 biotechnology companies focused on new drug development that completed Initial Public Offerings (IPOs) from 1997-2016. These companies contributed to development of 367 products that progressed to phase 3 and 144 new drug approvals through 2016, including 78 New Molecular Entities (NMEs). Key point of the study include:

For 70% of the approved products, development was initiated by the biotech company;

77% were developed with corporate partners and 87% were ultimately launched by a pharmaceutical partner or after an acquisition;

Seven products achieved annual sales of more than $1 billion during the study period;

Small molecule drugs, rather than traditional biological products (proteins, cells) comprised 75% of products reaching phase 3 and 78% of approvals.

Reformulations of existing products represented 36% of phase 3 products and 46% of approvals.

These biotech companies contributed to 16% of all New Molecular Entities approved 1997-2016 and 28% of biological approvals.

""We see that over two decades, the majority of newly public biotechnology companies are able to successfully initiate development of products that progress to late stage development or approval, most of which are ultimately brought to market by established pharmaceutical firms."" "" said Dr. Fred Ledley, Director of the Center for Integration of Science and Industry. ""Our study also shows that the product portfolio of biotech companies is no longer distinctively focused on novel biological products or methods, but encompasses a wide range of small molecules and reformulations.""

This study is one part of a large survey of the finances and late-stage product portfolios of companies with IPOs from 1997-2016, which show that, by the end of 2016, these companies had both created ~$100 billion in shareholder value and spawned 144 new products. While very few of these companies matured into fully integrated pharmaceutical companies, the long term economic performance of these biotech companies, in terms of market capitalization, shareholder value, fraction of companies acquired, and fraction of companies trading or sold above their IPO value, is similar to that of non-biotech companies with concurrent IPOs. Together these studies suggest that the risk of investing in public biotechnology companies is, in part, mitigated by this diversification into technologies with shorter times from IPO to approval and higher probabilities of success.

CytoDel announces successful intra-neuronal antibody delivery without a viral vector,"Studies show Cyto-111 enables delivery of antibodies to previously inaccessible intraneuronal targets without the need for a viral vector or transfection. Supports the development of new approaches to treat multiple neurological diseases

New York City, January 6, 2021 - CytoDel, Inc. (""CytoDel"" or ""the Company""), a privately-held corporation, today announces the publication of preclinical data on the Company's lead product, Cyto-111, in the peer-reviewed journal, Science Translational Medicine. The complete text of the article titled, ""Neuronal Delivery of Antibodies has Therapeutic Effects in Animal Models of Botulism,"" can be found here.

Cyto-111 was conceived, expressed and purified in the laboratory of Konstantin Ichtchenko, Ph.D., NYU Grossman School of Medicine, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, who was a principal investigator in the study, which was supported by grants from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), a division of the National Institute of Health (NIH).

Based on Dr. Ichtchenko's hypothesis that the C1ad delivery vehicle previously reported could be used to transport therapeutic proteins into the neuronal cytosol, researchers led by Dr. Ichtchenko developed and tested a potential treatment for botulism based on intracellular inhibition of the BoNT subtype A1 light chain metalloprotease (LC/A1). The main objective of the study was to develop and test a post-symptomatic botulism antidote that could rescue symptomatic animals challenged with a lethal dose of BoNT. Following in vitro validation of therapeutic mechanisms, efficacy studies were conducted in mice, guinea pigs and rhesus macaque monkeys.

The study showed that a precision biotherapeutic consisting of a function-blocking single domain antibody (sdAb; B8) cargo fused to the C1ad delivery vehicle (forming B8C1ad or Cyto-111) can enter neurons and protect SNARE proteins by inhibiting LC/A1 catalytic activity in situ. Post-symptomatic administration of B8C1ad produced antidotal rescue in mice, guinea pigs, and non-human primates following a lethal botulism challenge.

According to the study's authors, ""The flexibility of the C1ad molecular delivery platform offers several advantages for the rapid generation of new treatments for neurological disorders. In particular, the presynaptic localization of LC suggests this therapeutic approach will be particularly effective in treating synaptopathies involving active zone proteins. Indeed, the platform can be efficiently redirected towards other protein targets by replacing or adding single domain antibodies or other protein moieties.""

The study concluded that, ""These data demonstrate that atoxic BoNT derivatives can be harnessed to deliver therapeutic protein moieties to the neuronal cytoplasm where they bind and neutralize intracellular targets in experimental models. The generalizability of this platform might enable delivery of antibodies and other protein-based therapeutics to previously inaccessible intraneuronal targets.""

""This is a landmark study in converting the power of lethal botulinum neurotoxins into therapies. The approach used to turn botulinum toxin into a kind of Trojan horse that delivers a cargo into neurons has enormous potential for future drug development,"" noted Thomas C. Südhof, M.D., Professor in the School of Medicine in the Department of Molecular and Cellular Physiology, and in Neurology, Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at Stanford University, a 2013 Nobel Prize winner in Physiology/ Medicine, a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator, and Chair of CytoDel's Scientific Advisory Board.

""We are delighted to have these data published in a well-respected peer-reviewed journal as they represent the culmination of many years of research with the intent of finding a solution to effectively treat weaponized botulinum toxins. Importantly, these groundbreaking data are the result of the efforts of researchers from a number of renowned institutions including NYU Grossman School of Medicine, Tufts University Center for Translational Medicine, and the US Army Medical Research Institute for Chemical Defense, without whose hard work and dedication this achievement would not have been possible,"" commented Phillip A. Band, Ph.D., Research Professor in the Departments of Orthopedic Surgery, Biochemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, NYU Grossman School of Medicine, and co-inventor, co-founder and Chief Executive Officer of CytoDel.

""Not only did these studies show that Cyto-111 can be an antidote to botulinum toxins, but they demonstrate the generalizability of the molecular vehicle in three different species to safely and effectively deliver functional antibodies to the inside of neurons via a non-viral mechanism. This is a particularly exciting breakthrough as no other labs have previously inactivated a pathogen inside of neurons, which are inaccessible to standard antibodies. This achievement opens the door for the development of new approaches to treat multiple neurological diseases,"" added Dr. Band.

About Botulinum Neurotoxin

Botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT) is considered a Tier 1 weapon of mass destruction. BoNT has no odor or taste, a single gram is sufficient to kill 1 million humans via ingestion or inhalation, and currently there are no treatments to reverse symptoms. All currently available treatments for botulism are antibody products which can only neutralize toxin in the systemic circulation. Once the toxin has entered the neurons controlling respiration, generally 24-72 hours after exposure depending on the dose, antibody-based products become ineffective. Standard antibodies cannot access toxin already inside neurons, and thus BAT® (Botulism AntiToxin, a product of Emergent BioSolutions), the only FDA-approved antitoxin, is only effective while the toxin remains in the circulation.

About Cyto-111

Cyto-111 uses CytoDel's Intraneuronal Delivery Platform to deliver an antibody to the inside of BoNT-intoxicated neurons, thereby allowing rescue after the toxin has entered neurons and is causing symptoms. This ""Trojan horse"" approach uses an inactivated recombinant BoNT derivative to carry the antibody to the inside of BoNT-intoxicated neurons. Cyto-111 can uniquely reverse symptoms because it can deliver its antibody to toxin already inside the neuron. In biodefense scenarios, this significantly extends the period post-exposure during which treatment can reverse symptoms and can save lives by minimizing the need for long-term artificial respiration. As a therapeutic for naturally occurring botulism, Cyto-111 extends the therapeutic window beyond the current 48-hour limit during which BAT has proven to be effective.

About CytoDel

CytoDel is a privately held biopharmaceutical company that uses the tools of 21st century molecular biology to produce recombinant derivatives of botulinum neurotoxin customized to specific applications. The Company's proprietary technology allows CytoDel to manipulate the BoNT molecule to develop next generation BoNT products and a drug delivery vehicle that can deliver therapeutic molecules to the inside of neurons. CytoDel's lead program is focused on developing BioBetter BoNT pharmaceuticals, offering improved safety margin and effectiveness outcomes for the treatment of large muscles and muscle groups. A second program utilizes intraneuronal delivery for Biodefense, and CytoDel is also developing programs for the treatment of nervous system disorders and chronic pain.

Scientists need to understand how gill development limits fish growth,"The distribution and concentration of dissolved oxygen and water temperature in the oceans and freshwaters are usually far more influential in shaping the growth and reproduction of fish than the distribution of their prey.

In a new paper in Science Advances, Daniel Pauly, principal investigator of the Sea Around Us initiative at UBC's Institute for the Oceans and Fisheries, argues that scientists need to avoid attaching human attributes to fish and start looking at their unique biology and constraints through a different lens.

This lens is Pauly's own Gill Oxygen Limitation Theory (GOLT), which explains many features of fish biology and whose core principle is that as fish grow, the surface area of their gills - their respiratory organs - can't keep up with the oxygen requirement of their bodies.

The GOLT emphasizes that gills are surfaces through which water must flow - a bit like the wind through blinds. Gill surface area grows in two dimensions, that is, in length and width, but they cannot keep up with bodies that grow in three dimensions, length, width and depth. Thus, as fish get bigger, they have less gill surface area and their gills provide less oxygen per unit volume or weight.

""The problem is that many colleagues fail to understand the basic geometry of gills, and argue that, as fish grow bigger and, thus, require more oxygen, they can just grow larger gills,"" Pauly said. ""But they can't pack their heads full of gills because, if that were to happen, water wouldn't be able to flow through.""

Pauly's research indicates that the gill issue is a constraint, not something fish can evolve out of. This means that once their gills reach a point where the oxygen they supply cannot support a bigger body, they stop growing.

""This is particularly important in the context of climate change because warm waters contain less oxygen. This means that gills have less oxygen to supply to bodies that require more oxygen at higher temperatures"", Pauly said, ""This double whammy occurs because fish cannot maintain their body temperature constant, and higher water temperatures accelerate their metabolisms.""

Higher temperatures force fish to stop growing at a smaller size, given the little oxygen available to them. This has important implications for fisheries and aquaculture.

Despite having many applications, the GOLT has been the subject of criticisms. In this new paper, Pauly responds to these challenges point by point.

""In contrast to regular scientific papers, the 'data' here are published arguments against the GOLT and their counterarguments, presented in table form. These arguments are not serious; they are more like barnacles on the hulls of a boat, which slow it down but do not sink it"", Pauly said. ""They are based on a lack of understanding of key geometrical and biological concepts. Thus, it was important to clear them out so that the GOLT can start to be seriously studied, and its real problems addressed.""

The fact that the Gill Oxygen Limitation Theory is mainly qualitative and makes few quantitative predictions, is one of the real problems that Pauly himself has noticed and would like his colleagues to address, as well as the fact that it doesn't deal with bioenergetics and the role food plays in the life of fish.

""Food is necessary for life and the GOLT is structured around the notion that there is enough food but what if there isn't enough food? The relationships between food and oxygen will have to be studied, too,"" he said.

Scientists create ON-OFF switches to control CAR T cell activity,"CAR T cells are a breakthrough class of effective but often toxic cancer therapies

To prevent overactivation, switchable CAR T cells were engineered that can be turned on and off with an approved, widely used cancer drug

BOSTON - Scientists at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Mass General Cancer Center have created molecular ON-OFF switches to regulate the activity of CAR T cells, a potent form of cell-based immunotherapy that has had dramatic success in treating some advanced cancers, but which pose a significant risk of toxic side effects.

CAR T cells are immune cells genetically modified to recognize and attack tumors cells. Once given, these ""living drugs"" proliferate and kill tumor cells over weeks to months, in some cases causing life-threatening inflammatory reactions that are difficult to control. In this way, CAR T cells are unlike more established forms of cancer therapy - chemotherapy or radiotherapy for instance - whose dose can be precisely tuned up or down over time.

The scientists reported in Science Translational Medicine the development of switchable CAR T cells that can be turned on or off by giving a commonly used cancer drug, lenalidomide. In the laboratory, the researchers designed OFF-switch CAR T cells that could be quickly, reversibly turned off by administering the drug, after which the CAR T cells recovered their anti-tumor activity. Separately, the researchers also reported ON-switch CAR T cells that only killed tumor cells during lenalidomide treatment.

In the future, switchable cell therapies might allow patients with their physicians to take a pill - or not - to tune the amount of CAR T cell activity from day to day, hopefully reducing toxic side effects.

""From the start, our goal was to build cancer therapies that are less hard on people. Having built these switches using human genetic sequences and an FDA-approved drug, we are excited for the potential to translate this research to clinical use,"" said Max Jan, MD, PhD, first author of the report. He is affiliated with the laboratories of Benjamin Ebert, MD, PhD, and Marcela Maus, MD, PhD, the report's senior authors. Other authors include researchers from the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, and Harvard Medical School.

CAR T cells are created by harvesting immune T cells from the patient and reprogramming them in the laboratory to produce a finely-tuned receptor molecule, termed a CAR (for chimeric antigen receptor), that recognizes a distinctive protein on the surface of the patient's cancer cells. The CAR T cells, after being engineered in the lab and returned to the patient, circulate through the body and home in on the cancer cells by binding to the distinctive surface protein they have been engineered to recognize. This binding event stimulates an immune attack, destruction of the cancer cells, and proliferation of the CAR T cells.

A drawback, however, is that uncontrolled proliferation of the CAR T cells sometimes triggers cytokine release syndrome (CRS), the release of inflammation-causing signals throughout the body that can cause toxicities ranging from mild fever to life-threatening organ failure. Current management of these toxic reactions relies on intensive care unit support and drugs including immunosuppressive corticosteroids, while many researchers are trying to develop methods of controlling the activity of CAR T cells in order to prevent these toxic side effects.

""CAR T cells can be fantastically effective therapies, but they can also have serious toxicities and can cause significant morbidity and mortality,"" said Ebert who is Chair of Medical Oncology at Dana-Farber. ""They are currently difficult to control once administered to the patient.""

CAR T cell therapy has had most success in blood cancers. Three CAR T agents have been approved: Kymriah for children and young adults with B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), both Kymriah and Yescarta for treatment of adults with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and Tecartus for adults with mantle cell lymphoma. Scientists are investigating an array of different approaches with the aim of extending the reach of CAR T therapies to other blood cancers and to solid tumors, if a number of hurdles can be overcome, including the problem of treatment toxicity.

To create the ON and OFF switch systems for CAR T cells, the scientists used a relatively new technique known as targeted protein degradation. It exploits a mechanism that cells use to dispose of unwanted or abnormal proteins; the proteins are marked for destruction by a structure within cells that acts like a garbage disposal. A small number of drugs, including lenalidomide, act by targeting specific proteins for degradation using this pathway.

The researchers used this technique to engineer small protein tags that are sent to the cellular garbage disposal by lenalidomide. When this degradation tag was affixed to the CAR, it allowed the tagged CAR to be degraded during drug treatment, thereby stopping T cells from recognizing cancer cells. Because CAR proteins are continually manufactured by these engineered T cells, after drug treatment new CAR proteins accumulate and restore the cell's anti-tumor function. The researchers propose that the switch system might in the future allow patients to have their CAR T cell treatment temporarily paused to prevent short-term toxicity and still have long-term therapeutic effects against their cancer.

The scientists also built an ON-switch CAR by further engineering the proteins that physically interact with lenalidomide. This system has the potential to be especially safe, because the T cells only recognize and attack tumor cells during drug treatment. If used to treat cancers such as multiple myeloma that are sensitive to lenalidomide, ON-switch CAR T cells could allow for a coordinated attack by the immune cells and the drug that controls them.

""The long-term goal is to have multiple different drugs that control different on and off switches"" so that scientists can develop ""ever-more complex cellular therapies,"" explained Ebert.

"Mental health of UK women, ethnic minorities especially affected during pandemic","UK survey conducted before and during pandemic also indicates increase in average mental distress for all citizens

In the UK, men from ethnic minorities and women may have experienced worse mental health declines than White British men, according to a study published January 6, 2021 in the open access journal PLOS ONE by Eugenio Proto and Climent Quintana-Domeque of institutions including the University of Glasgow and the University of Exeter, UK.

The COVID-19 pandemic, and the measures enacted to restrict the spread of the virus, have had a major impact on the lives of citizens globally. The authors of the present study examined changes in mental health associated with the pandemic across ethnic groups in the UK.

The researchers used data from the UK Household Longitudinal Study, comparing responses from participants between 2017 and 2019 (i.e.: prior to the pandemic) to responses from the same participants in April 2020 (i.e.: during the pandemic, when severe ""lockdown"" restrictions were in place in the UK). A total of 14,523 individuals provided responses both before and during the pandemic; 91.5 percent defined their ethnicity as White British and the remaining 8.5 percent as another ethnicity (Black, Asian, and minority ethnic, or BAME). Participants were asked to self-report their health, including their mental wellbeing. These responses were used to measure levels of mental distress, on a scale from 0 to 36.

The authors found that the average mental distress for individuals had increased from 11.28 [95% CI: 11.17, 11.40] in 2017-2019 to 12.51 [95% CI: 12.38, 12.63] in April 2020, a 0.21 standard deviation increase [95% CI: 0.19, 0.23]. Women experienced a greater average increase in mental distress than men, and BAME men also experienced a greater average increase than White British men. While White British men saw an average increase in mental distress of 0.6 units on this scale, White British women experienced an average increase of 1.6 units. BAME men experienced an average increase of 1.5 units, and BAME women of 1.7 units.

While the study conclusions may be limited by the sample size of BAME individuals (only 1,066 of the participants defined themselves as BAME), and by mental distress being measured relatively early on in the pandemic, the research suggests that the pandemic may have particularly affected the mental wellbeing of women and BAME individuals. The authors state that their preliminary findings appear to indicate ""the impact of the lockdown and social distancing requirements on mental health being worse among minority ethnic groups.""

The authors add: ""Women and Black, Asian, and minority ethnic men experienced a higher average increase in mental distress than White British men from 2017-2019 to April 2020.""

Modern microbes provide window into ancient ocean,"Step into your new, microscopic time machine. Scientists at the University of Colorado Boulder have discovered that a type of single-celled organism living in modern-day oceans may have a lot in common with life forms that existed billions of years ago--and that fundamentally transformed the planet.

The new research, which will appear Jan. 6 in the journal Science Advances, is the latest to probe the lives of what may be nature's hardest working microbes: cyanobacteria.

These single-celled, photosynthetic organisms, also known as ""blue-green algae,"" can be found in almost any large body of water today. But more than 2 billion years ago, they took on an extra important role in the history of life on Earth: During a period known as the ""Great Oxygenation Event,"" ancient cyanobacteria produced a sudden, and dramatic, surge in oxygen gas.

""We see this total shift in the chemistry of the oceans and the atmosphere, which changed the evolution of life, as well,"" said study lead author Sarah Hurley, a postdoctoral research associate in the departments of Geological Sciences and Biochemistry. ""Today, all higher animals need oxygen to survive.""

To date, scientists still don't know what these foundational microbes might have looked like, where they lived or what triggered their transformation of the globe.

But Hurley and her colleagues think they might have gotten closer to an answer by drawing on studies of naturally-occurring and genetically-engineered cyanobacteria. The team reports that these ancient microbes may have floated freely in an open ocean and resembled a modern form of life called beta-cyanobacteria.

Studying them, the researchers said, offers a window into a time when single-celled organisms ruled the Earth.

""This research gave us the unique opportunity to form and test hypotheses of what the ancient Earth might have looked like, and what these ancient organisms could have been,"" said co-author Jeffrey Cameron, an assistant professor of biochemistry.

Take a breath

You can still make the case that cyanobacteria rule the planet. Hurley noted that these organisms currently produce about a quarter of the oxygen that comes from the world's oceans.

One secret to their success may lie in carboxysomes--or tiny, protein-lined compartments that float inside all living cyanobacteria. These pockets are critical to the lives of these organisms, allowing them to concentrate molecules of carbon dioxide within their cells.

""Being able to concentrate carbon allows cyanobacteria to live at what are, in the context of Earth's history, really low carbon dioxide concentrations,"" Hurley said.

Before the Great Oxidation Event, it was a different story. Carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere may have been as much as 100 times what they are today, and oxygen was almost nonexistent. For that reason, many scientists long assumed that ancient microorganisms didn't need carboxysomes for concentrating carbon dioxide.

""Cyanobacteria have persisted in some form over two billion years of Earth's history,"" she said. ""They could have been really different than today's cyanobacteria.""

To find out how similar they were, the researchers cultured jars filled with bright-green cyanobacteria under conditions resembling those on Earth 2 billion years ago.

Hurley explained that different types of cyanobacteria prefer to digest different forms, or ""isotopes,"" of carbon atoms. As a result, when they grow, die and decompose, the organisms leave behind varying chemical signatures in ancient sedimentary rocks.

""We think that cyanobacteria were around billions of years ago,"" she said. ""Now, we can get at what they were doing and where they were living at that time because we have a record of their metabolism.""

Resurrecting zombie microbes

In particular, the team studied two different types of cyanobacteria. They included beta-cyanobacteria, which are common in the oceans today. But the researchers also added a new twist to the study. They attempted to bring an ancient cyanobacterium back from the dead. Hurley and her colleagues used genetic engineering to design a special type of microorganism that didn't have any carboxysomes. Think of it like a zombie cyanobacterium.

""We had the ability to do what was essentially a physiological resurrection in the lab,"" said Boswell Wing, a study coauthor and associate professor of geological sciences.

But when the researchers studied the metabolism of their cultures, they found something surprising: Their zombie cyanobacterium didn't seem to produce a chemical signature that aligned with the carbon isotope signatures that scientists had previously seen in the rock record. In fact, the best fit for those ancient signals were likely beta-cyanobacteria--still very much alive today.

The team, in other words, appears to have stumbled on a living fossil that was hiding in plain sight. And, they said, it's clear that cyanobacteria living around the time of the Great Oxygenation Event did have a structure akin to a carboxysome. This structure may have helped cells to protect themselves from growing concentrations of oxygen in the air.

""That modern organisms could resemble these ancient cyanobacteria--that was really counterintuitive,"" Wing said.

Scientists, they note, now have a much better idea of what ancient cyanobacteria looked like and where they lived. And that means that they can begin running experiments to dig deeper into what life was like in the 2 billion-year-old ocean.

""Here is hard evidence from the geological record and a model organism that can shed new light on life on ancient Earth,"" Cameron said.

An analysis of 145 journals suggests peer review itself may not explain gender discrepancies in publication rates,"An analysis of 145 scholarly journals found that, among various factors that could contribute to gender bias and lesser representation of women in science, the peer review process itself is unlikely to be the primary cause of publishing inequalities. However, Flaminio Squazzoni and colleagues emphasize that the study does not account for many other factors that may affect women's representation in academia, including educational stereotypes and academic choices of priorities and specialties. Even as female representation has improved in fields such as the humanities, psychology, and the social sciences, a publication gap persists, with male authors continuing to publish more manuscripts in more prestigious journals. To better understand whether peer review and editorial processes contribute to these gender discrepancies, Squazzoni et al. leveraged an agreement on data sharing with several large scholarly publishers; the team includes authors from the publishing companies Elsevier, John Wiley & Sons, and Springer Nature. The researchers collected and analyzed almost 350,000 submissions to 145 journals by about 1.7 million authors, as well as more than 760,000 reviews completed by about 740,000 referees. The sampled journals were identified by publishers so as to maximize coverage of research fields, although journals from learned societies, among others, were not considered. They then analyzed each step of the editorial process for bias, including the selection of referees, referee recommendations, and the editorial decision for each manuscript. They also accounted for each submission's research field, its proportion of women authors, and the position of women in the author list, while controlling for the proportion of women among referees, journal impact factors, the number of authors per manuscript, and the type of peer review adopted by each journal (single-blind or double-blind). The authors note, however, that it was not possible to directly estimate the quality of each submission. Author gender did not appear to affect how frequently manuscripts were accepted in the life sciences and social sciences, while manuscripts with higher proportions of female authors were in fact more likely to succeed in biomedicine, health, and physical sciences. ""Our findings do not mean that peer review and journals are free from biases,"" the authors write. ""For instance, the reputation of certain authors and the institutional prestige of their academic affiliation, not to mention authors' ethnicity or the type of research submitted, could influence the process, and these factors could also have gender implications."" The researchers note that collaborative data sharing efforts from funding agencies, academic institutions, and scholarly citation databases will be necessary to further elucidate how existing structures determine academic opportunities.

Orange is the new 'block',"Photosynthetic organisms tap light for fuel, but sometimes there's too much of a good thing.

New research from Washington University in St. Louis reveals the core structure of the light-harvesting antenna of cyanobacteria or blue-green algae -- including key features that both collect energy and block excess light absorption. The study, published Jan. 6 in Science Advances, yields insights relevant to future energy applications.

Scientists built a model of the large protein complex called phycobilisome that collects and transmits light energy. Phycobilisomes allow cyanobacteria to take advantage of different wavelengths of light than other photosynthetic organisms, such as green plants on dry land.

This capability significantly increases global productivity from photosynthesis from across the solar energy spectrum -- but it is fraught with risk.

""For cyanobacteria, excess light absorption is inevitable -- and sometimes lethal,"" said Haijun Liu, research scientist in chemistry in Arts & Sciences at Washington University. Liu is the principal investigator and corresponding author of the new study, funded by the Department of Energy (DOE), Basic Energy Sciences.

""We've found interesting structural features in the interface where energy is transferred and regulated,"" he said. ""One of the regulatory processes called non-photochemical quenching is executed by a protein called orange carotenoid protein. A high-resolution structure of phycobilisome will allow us to understand such processes in detail.""

While researchers already knew that orange carotenoid protein helps protect cyanobacteria during high light conditions, they did not have a clear picture of all of the structural features at work.

They also did not know where and how orange carotenoid protein is sequestered in a living cyanobacteria cell.

""We were stunned when we first reached the current model,"" Liu said. ""We instantly noticed that an inactive orange carotenoid protein can actually get access to -- or simply fit snugly in -- the free space region between phycobilisome and PSII (the protein complex that receives energy from phycobilisome for photochemical reactions). Then it is ready to be recruited or activated by environmental cues.""

This structure was assembled by an all-Washington University team of analytical biochemists and structural biologists, including Himadri Pakrasi, the George William and Irene Koechig Freiberg Professor in Arts & Sciences.

The team used structural proteomics in combination with structural modeling to resolve the structure. The method was first developed by Liu in Pakrasi's lab a few years ago, in collaboration with members of a group led by Michael Gross, professor of chemistry in Arts & Sciences and of immunology and internal medicine at the School of Medicine. The unique platform they created gave them significant advantages over other labs that had attempted to approach similar biological questions with electron microscope, cryo-electron microscope and other techniques.

The basic science groundwork in this new research helps explain how living organisms maximize photosynthetic efficiency during early events of photosynthesis. This theme was also supported by the Photosynthetic Antenna Research Center (PARC) at Washington University -- one of 46 DOE Energy Frontier Research Centers, formerly directed by Robert E. Blankenship, the Lucille P. Markey Distinguished Professor in Arts & Sciences Emeritus.

The new work will help future efforts to design biohybrid or synthetic systems that harness energy from light.

How to talk about death and dying,"Our reluctance to think, talk or communicate about death is even more pronounced when we deal with others' loss compared to our own, new research finds, but either way we tend to frame attitudes and emotions in a sad and negative way.

Teaching new more positive ways to address these difficult conversations is the focus of a new paper in PLOS ONE journal by palliative care specialists across Australia. Led by Flinders University's Research Centre for Palliative Care, Death and Dying (RePaDD) and Palliative and Supportive Services, researchers from Flinders, CQUniversity Australia, NT Palliative Care Central Australia and University of Technology Sydney, surveyed 1,491 people about the use of language to express their feelings and insights into death and dying.

Those surveyed were enrolled in Dying2Learn, a six-week MOOC (massive open online course) course developed at Flinders University to encourage open conversation about death and dying.

Analysis of the emotional content of the words used by the group showed that by the end of the course participants were able to use ""more pleasant, calmer and dominating (in-control) words to express their feelings about death"", researchers conclude in PLOS ONE.

""In an ageing population, when our elders and terminally ill are often cared for by health professionals in residential care rather than in the home, we can go through life without really discussing or witnessing the end of life,"" says lead author Dr Lauren Miller-Lewis, Flinders University research associate and CQUniversity positive psychology lecturer.

""Tackling and changing these perspectives will help the community to plan for and manage future needs and expectations of care at end-of-life, improve patient and family care - including greater preparedness for death - and also help develop future health services.

""Words aren't neutral, so understanding the emotional connotations tied to words we use could help guide palliative care conversations,"" Dr Miller-Lewis says.

Dying2Learn was an innovative online course developed as part of the CareSearch project, with funding from the Australian Government. The course ran four times in 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2020.

A new interactive online resource will be released on the CareSearch website in mid-2021 using insights, feedback and suggestions from the Dying2Learn program to ""help all of us be able to start and respond to conversations about death and dying with our family, our neighbours, and work colleagues"" (see the webpage here).

Flinders Professor Jennifer Tieman, RePaDD Centre Director and Dying2Learn lead investigator, says the new web content will further assist community to help them feel more comfortable thinking about - and talking about - death and dying as a part of life.

Professor Tieman says further studies using sentiment analysis could provide valuable insights into the way people feel about this issue, and other topics including palliative care, advance care planning, voluntary assisted dying and COVID-19.

Co-author Flinders University Computer Scientist Dr Trent Lewis says automated sentiment or emotional analysis of the words used showed a greater benefit for younger participants of the course who showed a bigger increase in pleasantness (valence) and dominance (power or control) by the end of the course, showing the benefit of gaining insights into becoming more emotionally accepting of death.

""It shows how the general public can gain an acceptance of death as a natural part of life by learning how to openly discuss and address these feelings and attitudes,"" he says.

The study also found differences between how course participants described the feelings towards death and dying of other people in the community compared to their own - with 'sad', 'fear', 'scary' and 'loss' more common than their own preference for less emotionally negative words such as 'inevitable', 'peace' and 'natural'.

""The assumption was that others feel more negatively about death then they do themselves,"" Dr Lewis says.

""This could impact on our willingness to start conversations about death with others,"" adds Dr Miller-Lewis. ""Do we avoid it because we think others will get upset if we bring it up, and does this then leave important things unsaid?"" she asks.

Investment risk & return from emerging public biotech companies comparable to non-biotech,"Investing in biotech companies may not entail higher risk than investing in other sectors, according to a new report from Bentley University's Center for Integration of Science and Industry.

Researchers studied the financial performance of 319 biotechnology companies focused on developing therapeutic products that completed IPOs from 1997-2016. These emerging, public biotech companies characteristically had little revenue, high R&D expense, and negative profit (losses) in contrast to non-biotechnology companies, which generated substantial revenue, little or no R&D, and consistent profit after 2001. Despite these differences, the study demonstrates that paired biotech and non-biotech companies had similar rates of success and failure. The analysis shows that 42% of biotechs and 40% of non-biotechs reached $1 billion valuations, while 53% of biotechs and 51% of non-biotechs failed to maintain their IPO market value. Companies also generated similar amounts of shareholder value, though non-biotechnology companies achieved greater net capital creation.

""Despite the extraordinary performance of the biotech sector in recent years, biotech is still often portrayed as a high risk investment. Our study suggests that, in fact, the high-risk, high-return pattern associated with biotech companies after their IPO is a common characteristic of companies completing IPOs from other sectors as well."" said Dr. Fred Ledley, Director of the Center for Integration of Science and Industry. ""This study also suggests that, for these emerging, public companies, the science-based, biotech business model generates equivalent economic value to more traditional, revenue-based business models.""

This study is one part of a large survey of the finances and late stage product portfolios of companies that completed their IPOs over recent decades. These studies show that, while more than 50% of emerging, public biotechnology companies had products that achieved FDA approval, most companies developing products were acquired within several years of their first product approvals, and only four companies achieved revenues of $1 billion by the end of 2016. Thus, despite considerable success in product development and substantial value generation, biotech IPOs from 1997-2016 generated few new large, biopharmaceutical companies.

"We've already blown past the warming targets set by the Paris climate agreement, study finds","It's already too late to meet the warming limit of 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit (2 degrees Celsius) set by the Paris Agreement in 2015, according to a new study.

Still, all is not lost: It's possible to put off the inevitable for centuries, rather than years or decades, if societies act soon to cut emissions.

In the new study, published Jan. 4 in the journal Nature Climate Change , researchers take a new look at the problem of ""committed warming."" That term refers to the idea that the warming already underway and pollution already in the atmosphere will have cascading effects that will cause the future to be warmer than the present, even if all greenhouse gas emissions stopped tomorrow. Researchers have long factored committed warming into climate models, but the new paper added a positive feedback loop the researchers call ""the pattern effect"" — ongoing changes in patterns related to sea-surface temperature and sea ice that may be unstoppable and will erode the planet's ability to cool itself over the long-term. Essentially, as places that are extremely cold right now warm, they'll lose the clouds and sea ice that once reflected heat back into space.

The Paris Agreement committed nations of the world to holding climate change to 3.6 F (2 C) over pre-industrial temperatures. Already, the world is about 1.8 F (1 C) warmer than it was during pre-industrial times, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change . Even if all emissions stopped tomorrow, the study found, centuries from now global temperatures will still end up 4.1 F (2.3 C) warmer than they were in the pre-industrial era.

""You've got some ... global warming inertia that's going to cause the climate system to keep warming, and that's essentially what we're calculating,"" study co-author Andrew Dessler, a climate scientist at Texas A&M University, told the Associated Press (AP). ""Think about the climate system like the Titanic. It's hard to turn the ship when you see the icebergs.""

Related: 10 climate myths busted

This paper is not yet settled science, and other researchers will evaluate the conclusions before arriving at consensus as to whether Dessler and his coauthors got their calculations right, according to the AP.

Dessler warned against ""climate doomers"" who would take this as a reason to stop trying to prevent warming. Lowering global net carbon emissions to zero as soon as possible would still make a significant difference in the lives of people on Earth in the short- and long-terms. The paper did not consider the potential impacts of still-speculative technologies proposed to pull carbon out of the atmosphere.

""If we don't, we're going to blow through (climate goals) in a few decades,"" Dessler told the AP. ""It's really the rate of warming that makes climate change so terrible. If we got a few degrees over 100,000 years, that would not be that big a deal. We can deal with that. But a few degrees over 100 years is really bad.""

And of course, if emissions continue, the eventual peak of warming will be substantially higher than the 4.1 F (2.3 C) the paper predicts if emissions stopped tomorrow.

"COVID-19 vaccines may cause allergic reactions in 1 in 100,000 jabs","Serious allergic reactions after COVID-19 vaccines are likely more common than serious reactions following flu vaccines , but are still very rare, according to a new report.

The report authors, from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) , analyzed data from the first 1.9 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine administered in the U.S. from Dec. 14 through Dec. 23. For most of this time, only the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine was available in the U.S.

The researchers identified 21 cases of people who experienced anaphylaxis — a potentially life-threatening allergic reaction — shortly after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine.

That's a rate of about 11 cases of anaphylaxis per 1 million doses of vaccine administered. For comparison, the rate of anaphylaxis following flu vaccination is 1.3 cases per million people, Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said during a news conference on Wednesday (Jan. 6).

Even though the rate of anaphylaxis tied to COVID-19 vaccines is about 10 times higher than what's seen with flu vaccines, ""it's still exceedingly rare,"" Messonnier said. Overall, the benefits of the vaccine outweigh the potential risks, she said.

Related: 7 strange signs you're having an allergic reaction

Of the 21 cases described in the report, 17 had a history of allergies or allergic reactions, including reactions to drugs, food and insect stings; and seven of those people had experienced anaphylaxis in the past. Nearly all of these patients were treated with epinephrine following their reaction to the COVID-19 vaccine, and all 21 recovered.

Although the new report included only cases of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine, the CDC is aware of confirmed cases of anaphylaxis tied to the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine as well.

Exactly what's causing these reactions is unclear, and ""tremendous efforts"" are underway to better understand the cause, Messonnier said. One potential culprit is polyethylene glycol, an ingredient in both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, Live Science previously reported .

However, having allergies doesn't necessarily put you at higher risk of reactions to COVID-19 vaccines. Allergies are common in the U.S., but serious reactions to the vaccines are not.

The CDC recommends that people with a history of reactions to vaccines or anaphylaxis due to any cause should be observed by health care staff for 30 minutes after they receive their COVID-19 shot. (In the report, patients experienced anaphylaxis on average about 13 minutes after their COVID-19 shot.)

The agency recommends that people not receive the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine if they have a known allergy to an ingredient in these vaccines, including polyethylene glycol; and people should not receive a second dose if they have a serious reaction to the first.

"VIDEO: Chaos at Capitol as Trump Supporters Battle Police, Buildings Evacuate, Chamber Recess","As Congress debated confirming the results of the 2020 presidential election, a chaotic scene played out in front of the Capitol building as pro-Trump protesters battled police amid demands to overturn the election results.

Adding to the confusion were reports that the Capitol Police had ordered the evacuation of two nearby buildings, the Cannon House Office Building and the Library of Congress’ Madison Building. An all-clear was sounded shortly afterwards, but anxiety remains high. Shortly afterwards, as protesters entered the actual building, the two chambers recessed.

On Twitter, various videos depict Capitol cops clashing with pro-Trump protestors as they storm the steps.

Giuliani calls for 'trial by combat' at D.C. rally,"National Review

On Tuesday, authorities in Wisconsin announced they would not be prosecuting Rusten Sheskey, the officer who shot and paralyzed Jacob Blake in August of last year — an incident that set off protests and riots in Kenosha, a city near the Illinois border. To justify this decision, they released two reports, one from the Kenosha County District Attorney’s Office and another from Noble Wray, a retired police chief and Obama-administration police reformer who’d been asked to render an independent assessment.Some important details of the shooting remain unclear, largely because Kenosha police did not have body cameras at the time. The incident was captured only on bystanders’ cell phones, videos from which do not show the whole situation. But when it comes to the question of a criminal prosecution, the documents are highly compelling: There is no way to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Sheskey fired without justification. If anything, the evidence tips in the opposite direction.Officer Sheskey and two other cops showed up in response to a call from Laquisha Booker, the mother of Blake’s kids. She said that Blake had taken the keys to her rental vehicle, and that he’d borrowed vehicles from her and crashed them in the past. She added that Blake was “not supposed to be here,” but that she’d let him visit for his son’s birthday. Police dispatchers told the officers that Blake had a felony arrest warrant for domestic-violence offenses and sexual assault, meaning they’d have to arrest him if they found him, under Kenosha Police Department policy.When they arrived, according to the officers and another witness, Booker said that Blake was trying to take her car and her kids — and Blake was seen putting a child in a gray SUV. Sheskey has said he wasn’t sure if the child was Blake’s or not. In truth, there were three kids in the SUV, all Blake’s.The cops tried to arrest Blake. He resisted. Two different officers shot him with Tasers, but he ripped out the probes. And to make matters worse, Blake produced a knife. Despite some claims in the media that Blake was “unarmed,” he admitted having the knife himself, there’s video of the officers telling him to drop it, and the weapon was found open in the SUV after the incident. According to the DA office’s report, Blake also resisted arrest with a knife in a 2010 incident.And then came a fateful series of decisions. As seen in the widely disseminated cell-phone video, Blake walked around the SUV and opened the door. Sheskey followed and grabbed Blake’s shirt, then fired seven times. He says he stopped shooting when Blake dropped the knife, consistent with his training to shoot until the threat stops.Were the shots justified? The key question is whether Sheskey reasonably believed lethal force was necessary to stop an imminent threat of “death or great bodily harm,” whether to him or to someone else.Sheskey, another officer, and some witnesses say that Blake twisted his body toward Sheskey before the shots rang out, which would have moved the knife toward the officer. Per the district attorney’s office, “Officer Sheskey stated that for the first time Jacob Blake showed intent to harm [as opposed to just resisting arrest] by driving the knife towards Officer Sheskey's torso.” Such an action would clearly justify deadly force.However, this gesture is not obvious in the video, at least not to me. (You can see the recording on YouTube, and move frame-by-frame using the “<” and “>” buttons on your keyboard.) That said, I wouldn’t say the video disproves these claims, either — the more important question in court, where the burden is on the prosecution — because the SUV’s door and the cops’ bodies obscure some of Blake’s movements.And at any rate, as Noble Wray’s report adds, whether> Blake drove the knife forward or not, a reasonable officer could view himself as being in imminent danger. P.O. Sheskey was literally holding on to Blake's shirt, and Blake had a knife in his hand, actively resisting, attempting to get into the vehicle. This circumstance is only compounded with the kids being in the vehicle.Of course, it was Sheskey’s own decision to grab Blake’s shirt, and there are various ways we might second-guess the officers’ actions even if we don’t prosecute them. But when it comes to those crucial final moments, the truth is that Blake put them in an impossible situation. They could have kept a safe distance from the guy with a sexual-assault warrant armed with a knife, but that would have meant letting that guy get into a vehicle they knew contained at least one child — an option that could lead to a high-speed chase or a hostage situation, both possibilities that Sheskey says he feared at the time. On the other hand, once Sheskey got close to a knife-wielding suspect, the chance he’d need to use deadly force shot way up, because knives are incredibly deadly at that range and there isn’t much time to ascertain and react to a suspect’s movements.Or, as Wray put it:> Officer Sheskey had determined that it was dangerous for the public and the child in the car to let Blake go. P.O. Sheskey felt he could not retreat once he made the decision that harm could come to the kids or to the public. I found Officer Sheskey's analysis was reasonable based on the limited information he had at the time. Officer Sheskey did not know the relationship between Blake and the child. I am not sure if it makes much difference. The U.S. Department of Justice reports in 2010 that 200,000 kids are abducted mostly by a family friend or parent. Blake's severe resistance to being taken into custody would lead a reasonable officer to believe that he would engage in a high-speed pursuit.I have no idea what actually would have happened if Sheskey hadn’t fired. I’m glad I didn’t have to make that decision myself. And I’m glad prosecutors aren’t dragging this situation out by pursuing a case they could never win.",[],https://news.yahoo.com,high
Jon Ossoff declares victory in Georgia Senate runoff as race remains too close to call,"Democrat Jon Ossoff is claiming victory over Republican David Perdue in their Georgia Senate runoff, though the race still remains too close to call.

The Democratic Senate candidate spoke during a live stream on Wednesday morning as the latest results show him leading Perdue by about 16,000 votes with 98 percent of votes reported, according to The New York Times. A winner in the race has not yet been projected by The Associated Press or any of the major television networks, however, and Perdue hasn't conceded.

""It is with humility that I thank the people of Georgia for electing me to serve you in the United States Senate,"" Ossoff said. ""Thank you for the confidence and trust that you have placed in me.""

Ossoff in his address also pledged to ""serve all the people of the state"" and ""give everything I've got to ensuring that Georgia's interests are represented in the U.S. Senate.""

Democrat Raphael Warnock was previously projected to defeat Sen. Kelly Loeffler (R-Ga.) in their Senate runoff. A victory by Ossoff would, therefore, allow Democrats to take control of the Senate, creating a 50-50 split between both parties where ties would be broken by Vice President-elect Kamala Harris.

If Democrats Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff maintain their leads and win both up-for-grab Georgia Senate seats when the votes are all counted from Tuesday's election, the Senate will be split 50-50. Once Vice President-elect Kamala Harris is sworn in on Jan. 20, Democrats will have 51 votes and control of the chamber — Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) will be majority leader and Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) will be minority leader, among other changes.> If everything stands here's some a look into a shift in Senate committee leadership. > > The following shift from ranking to chairman> > Banking, Housing, Urban Affairs: Sherrod Brown > > Budget: Bernie Sanders > > Finance: Ron Wyden > > HELP: Patty Murray > > Appropriations: Patrick Leahy> > — Yashar Ali (@yashar) January 6, 2021There have only been three other 50-50 Senate splits in U.S. history, mostly for short periods, The Washington Post reports, and it isn't clear how this one will work out. The last time the Senate was evenly divided, from January to June 2001, Democratic leader Tom Daschle (S.D.) and Republican leader Trent Lott (Miss.) reached a power-sharing agreement in which the committees were split evenly. Lott was majority leader from when Vice President Dick Cheney (R) took office until Democrats convinced Vermont Republican Jim Jeffords to switch parties, giving Democrats a 51-49 majority.For those six months, ""I could have been a horse's rear, and said, 'We have the majority, the hell with you,'"" Lott told the Post on Tuesday. ""And we would have had daily warfare."" The Senate could replicate that 2001 agreement, as McConnell suggested in 2016, but Lott is skeptical, given the increased polarization in the Senate. ""Tom Daschle and I used to talk more in a day than Mitch McConnell and Chuck Schumer do in a month of Sundays,"" he said.Either way, Democrats can use their 51 votes to set the Senate agenda, green-light President-elect Joe Biden's Cabinet and other appointees, confirm federal judges and Supreme Court nominees, and pass certain budget-related items under the reconciliation process. Most other legislation needs 60 votes to overcome a filibuster — which Democrats could also scrap but won't, thanks to objections from Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) and other moderates.Since Democrats also control the House, the Post's Dave Weigel notes, they can use the Congressional Review Act to kill any Trump administration regulations enacted in the past few months, as Republicans did liberally with Obama administration regulations in early 2017. If either Georgia Democrat loses, the Senate remains in GOP control.More stories from theweek.com 7 scathing cartoons about Trump's Georgia phone call Republicans are 'privately furious' at Trump over the Georgia election losses Are we witnessing the fall of the United States?",[],https://news.yahoo.com,high
Pence breaks with Trump and says he won’t overturn election as president threatens him on stage,"National Review

On Saturday, eleven Republican senators led by Ted Cruz (R., Texas) announced a plan to vote “to reject the electors from disputed states” when Congress convenes to count the electoral votes and declare a winner of the presidential election, unless and until an “emergency 10-day audit is completed.” These senators want Congress to “immediately appoint an Electoral Commission, with full investigatory and fact-finding authority” based on the model of the Electoral Commission created to resolve the disputed 1876 election.To better understand why this plan is both illegal and a terrible idea, some background history is necessary. The Constitution’s Twelfth Amendment stipulates that the electors from each state must meet, vote, and record their votes in two separate lists, one for president and one for vice president. They must then “sign and certify” those lists and transmit them “sealed to the seat of the government of the United States, directed to the President of the Senate.” Once the lists make their way to Congress, the “President of the Senate shall, in the presence of the Senate and House of Representatives, open all the certificates and the votes shall then be counted.”This passive-voice phrasing crucially leaves out who does the counting. And the Twelfth Amendment is also silent on the extent to which the power to count includes the power to judge whether particular votes should count. As Justice Joseph Story observed in his 1833 Commentaries on the Constitution, “no provision is made for the discussion or decision of any questions, which may arise, as to the regularity and authenticity of the returns of the electoral votes,” and it “seems to have been taken for granted, that no question could ever arise on the subject.”Unfortunately, that assumption turned out to be overly optimistic. Controversies did arise, culminating in the disputed Hayes–Tilden election of 1876, which legislators settled by passing an emergency bill after the electors had cast their ballots but before Congress had counted them. The bill established a commission to determine the winner of each disputed state, but it did not attempt to set any long-term precedent.After decades of uncertainty and ad hoc answers good for one election only, Congress resolved to definitively settle the Twelfth Amendment’s ambiguities in 1887 with the passage of the Electoral Count Act (ECA). Avoiding the chaos and uncertainty of the 1876 election was a key goal of the bill; Representative Charles Baker expressed the common desire to “provide against a recurrence of the vexed questions that once threatened the welfare and peace of our country” and to select a president in such a way “so that the possibility of dissension and strife shall be avoided.” Representative John Eden noted the fraught history of election procedures being “decided upon the spur of the moment and amid the excitement of party contests.” Representative Hilary Herbert, putting it even more starkly, recalled that eleven years earlier “the country was on the eve of civil war because we had a disputed Presidential election” and because there was no law in place “under which the count could be made.”Congress believed that filling the gaps in the text of the Twelfth Amendment was the way to prevent such chaos in the future. During the congressional debate over the ECA, Representative Samuel Dibble remarked with consternation that it had been “a question ever since [the Twelfth Amendment] was adopted, by whom the votes shall be counted.”There was also significant disagreement and uncertainty over how much adjudicative authority the power to count entailed. To some members of Congress, the count was purely a formality. Representative Dibble described it as “the kind of ascertainment that the clerk of a court or a registering officer exercises when he reads the decree of the court, in order to record it,” which is to say, “a ministerial act, not a judicial act.” But others took a different view. Representative William Cooper argued that the power to count included the power to ascertain whether each list was “in fact the lawful vote of a State.” Representative George Adams similarly believed that legal judgment is implied in the duty to count and that Congress’s “determination that [an] alleged return is the legal return is the counting of the vote of that State within the meaning of the Constitution.”Representative Andrew Caldwell, one of the primary drafters of the ECA, proclaimed that its passage would end these debates and “settle all the questions which have arisen from time to time as to the electoral count.” The act, he said, would establish “first, that the power to count the vote is not in the President of the Senate” but instead “in the two Houses of Congress,” and, second, that the “power of the two Houses in counting the vote is something more than ministerial and perfunctory merely.” Congress would have the power “to determine what are legal votes, and who has a majority of legal votes” because the “power to judge of the legality of the votes is a necessary consequent of the power to count.”To that end, the ECA gave Congress the authority to reject an illegal electoral vote by a majority vote of both houses. But the ECA’s drafters knew how explosive and consequential that power could be if it were ever exercised, so they laid out narrow grounds for rejecting an electoral vote as illegal: Only those votes that have not been “regularly given by electors whose appointment has been lawfully certified” can be rejected.Thus, the ECA creates two specific categories of illegality: To be illegal, an electoral vote must either have been not “regularly given” or not “lawfully certified.” And at the time of the bill’s passage, neither category was understood to cover a belief that the election of an elector was flawed.The inquiry into whether an electoral vote was “regularly given” involves questions not about how the elector was chosen, but instead about the elector’s act of voting for president itself — whether it complied with the basic, facially apparent requirements of procedure. Those who drafted and passed the ECA provided a helpful litany of examples of valid reasons for Congress to reject an electoral vote as not “regularly given,” including: if the vote was not cast “by ballot as the law requires,” if the vote was not cast “upon the day appointed by law,” if an elector failed to “sign and certify” the vote, if an elector failed to cast at least one vote for “a citizen of another State,” and if the vote were for someone not constitutionally “eligible to the office” of president (such as someone not “a native-born citizen, or over thirty-five years of age”).Complementing these potential procedural deficiencies, the category of votes not “lawfully certified” encompassed attempted certifications of persons rendered ineligible to be electors, most likely by some structural constitutional provision. Examples included: if the vote was cast by an elector “ineligible to that office” (such as someone already holding another office), if a state attempted to cast a total number of electoral votes not “equal to her number of Senators and Representatives,” if a state attempted to cast electoral votes after abandoning a republican form of government, or if a territory not yet admitted as a state (or not yet readmitted as a state) attempted to cast electoral votes (a much more plausible problem for those who had lived through the gradual readmission of the seceded states after the Civil War).Although Congress contemplated the unlikely event of someone claiming to be an elector despite the legally mandated election for electors having not occurred, conspicuously absent from the debate over the ECA was any discussion of objections based on a wholesale relitigation of the conduct of an election for the electors. Both the structure and history of the ECA support the view that general concerns about the administration of an election were not viewed as falling under either category of valid objection when the law was passed.The ECA was expressly written to prevent a repeat of the interminable 1876 dispute. Rather than allowing Congress to kick the can of accountability to a commission, it requires that a decision on each objection to an electoral vote must be reached after a debate strictly limited to two hours. This structure makes sense only if objections are of a type that can be meaningfully considered and decided in two hours, i.e., if they involve facial legal problems with the electors rather than complex factual allegations of problems with their election.What does all this history tell us about the eleven Republican senators seeking to “reject the electors from disputed states” when Congress meets to count the electoral votes and declare a winner on Wednesday? Well, first and foremost, none of their disputes with the 2020 election plausibly qualify as a challenge to an electoral vote as having not been “regularly given” or “lawfully certified.” Indeed, the senators’ stated plan to object to the votes as both “not ‘regularly given’ and ‘lawfully certified’ (the statutory requisite)” without differentiation between the two demonstrates that they are not even attempting to take seriously the text of the bill as it was understood at the time of passage. To be sure, the ECA can always be altered by the passage of a new bill, which is presumably the vehicle by which these senators will demand a new electoral commission. But unless and until such an amendment to the ECA passes, the ECA is still binding. And the very fact that these senators acknowledge they would need a commission to meaningfully investigate their issues with the election shows that their challenge does not faithfully qualify as an ECA challenge.The ECA codified an important lesson learned from 1876 and earlier elections: Congress as an institution is ill-suited to the type of quick, fact-intensive, and impartial investigation necessary to competently resolve questions about the administration of an election. Those questions are better left to the courts, so the ECA, among other things, moved the counting of electoral votes back to “more than double the time the states had to determine the outcome of their elector elections.”That is what happened, successfully, in the 2020 election. Although the letter by the eleven Republican senators disingenuously notes that the Supreme Court has twice declined review of cases arising from the 2020 election, this does not mean, as the letter implies, that courts have not “heard evidence and resolved these claims of serious election fraud.” The state and federal judiciary encompasses vastly more than the Supreme Court, and cases have been heard and decided in dozens of courts across the country, as the ECA contemplates.Speaking in support of the ECA’s passage in December 1886, Representative Herbert presciently observed that the “country never will be satisfied in any political case with a temporary expedient or device under a law passed at the moment, after parties had taken sides on the question.” The 1876 commission failed to attain legitimacy, he argued, because the people “want laws passed before cases arise, and not with reference to any special case that may have arisen” already.Those senators inviting a repeat of the chaos of 1876 today would do well to consider the wisdom of Herbert and other men who lived through it.",[],https://news.yahoo.com,high
Who controls the US Senate and can Georgia flip it? OLD,"The east side of the US Capitol in the early morning. Senate Chamber in the foreground. (Getty Images)

The US Senate is the upper chamber of Congress, the lower chamber being the House of Representatives. Together they are the legislative branch of the federal government, the other two branches being the executive branch (the presidency, cabinet, federal agencies) and the judicial branch (the Supreme Court and other courts).

Consisting of 100 Senators — two per state — each lawmaker serves a six-year term staggered against the other representative from their state. Since the ratification of the 17th Amendment in 1913 they have been elected by popular vote.

At present, the political breakdown of the Senate is that the Republican Party holds a majority with 52 seats, while the Democratic Party has 46 seats, but are also joined by two independent senators who caucus with the party.

The Republicans are led by Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, and majority whip John Thune of South Dakota. As in the British parliament, party whips work to ensure senators vote in line with the desires of party leadership.

The Democrats are led by Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer of New York, and minority whip Dick Durbin of Illinois.

The two independent senators are Angus King Jr of Maine and Bernie Sanders of Vermont.

With party line voting and increasingly entrenched partisanship, Republicans have the votes to thwart any legislation passed by the Democrat-controlled House.

The runoff elections in Georgia are therefore important for several reasons. First off, they are happening on 5 January 2021 because no Senate candidate in the state achieved a majority in the 3 November general election, which is required under Georgia state law.

Having both Senate seats on the ballot in a state is a very rare occurrence. While incumbent Republican David Perdue’s term is up, fellow Republican Kelly Loeffler was appointed to her seat by Governor Brian Kemp following the resignation of her predecessor, Johnny Isakson. As such she had to face a popular vote in a special election.

They are running against Democrats Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock, and polling has each race close to a tie. This is important as Democrats narrowly won the state of Georgia in the presidential election for the first time since 1992. They are hoping to repeat this feat in January as the fate of President-elect Joe Biden’s legislative agenda hangs in the balance.

Read more: When will we know the results of the Georgia Senate runoff election?

There are three possible outcomes. If the Republicans win both seats and return Mr Perdue and Ms Loeffler to the Senate then the Biden administration will find it extremely difficult to pass legislation through the upper chamber.

Any bills that are passed will likely include huge concessions on the part of Democrats, and while Mr Biden prides himself on his many years of work in the Senate and ability to reach a compromise, it is far from ideal for the party, especially the progressive wing. Republicans would also retain control of what comes up for a vote — more on that later.

The same is true if each party won one seat. A split of 51:49 in favour of the Republicans would present the same challenges, but negotiating a compromise with just one senator from the opposing party is more attainable than negotiating with two.

Were the Democrats to win both seats and split the chamber 50:50 between the parties, things get interesting as the president of the Senate casts the deciding vote to break any tie on a simple majority vote — if present.

Helpfully for the Democrats, that role is fulfilled by the vice president, soon to be Kamala Harris. There would be unified government across the executive branch and both legislative chambers for the first two years of the Biden administration.

Senators that often cross party lines, such as Susan Collins of Maine for the Republicans or Joe Manchin of West Virginia for the Democrats, will be important in passing legislation.

As for leadership in a 50:50 split, the main task is setting the agenda of what gets brought up for debate or given a vote and what gets left to flounder. Currently, Mr McConnell holds that power. If Democrats are victorious in Georgia, Mr Schumer will be in control.

This would allow legislation on a number of Democrat priorities to move forward, including additional pandemic relief funds, potential tax increases on the very wealthy, and a major infrastructure package as promised in the election.

There would also be action on the John Lewis Voting Rights Act, climate change, criminal justice reform, and marijuana decriminalisation. In addition, the fate of the Affordable Care Act would be decided.

A Senate run by Mr Schumer would also likely move to get rid of the filibuster ensuring that legislation can be brought to a vote by a simple majority of 51, rather than dying a death under the threat of the need for 60 votes for cloture on efforts to prolong debate indefinitely.

Senate control is also important for cabinet and judicial nominations, which could be crucial for Mr Biden to get the team in place that he wants.

Committee chair positions would also go to Democrats and they hold the key to deciding what to bring to a vote, be it legislation or nominations.

They also determine whether to carry out investigations. Were Republicans to maintain their majority they would likely pursue probes into the 2020 election and Hunter Biden, potentially handicapping or disrupting the administration from early on.

Democrats therefore see the Georgia runoff races as vital to advancing their legislative agenda, while Republicans see Mr Perdue and Ms Loeffler as a firewall against that threat.

On 5 January, approximately 5 million voters in Georgia get to decide how this all plays out.

Pelosi gavels Congress for Electoral College vote,"The Conversation

Mike Pence has remained one of the only constants in the often chaotic Trump administration.Variously described as “vanilla,” “steady” and loyal to the point of being “sycophantic,” he is, in the words of one profile, an “everyman’s man with Midwest humility and approachability,” and in another, a “61-year-old, soft-spoken, deeply religious man.”But that humility and loyalty are being tested as his tenure as vice president draws to an end. “I hope Mike Pence comes through for us,” Trump told supporters at a rally on Monday, seemingly under the mistaken belief that Pence can overturn the election result as he presides over the Electoral College vote count at a joint session of Congress today. Balancing the ticketThroughout the past four years, the vice president has offered a striking contrast to the mercurial, abrasive temperament of his commander in chief. Indeed, in his acceptance speech at the 2016 Republican National Convention, Pence joked that he’d been chosen because Trump, with his “large personality,” “colorful style,” and “lots of charisma,” was “looking for some balance on the ticket.” Commentators have attributed Pence’s steadiness to his Hoosier roots and his “savvy political operator” skills. But it is his religious beliefs that perhaps inform his politics and style more than anything else; as Pence has oft repeated, he is “a Christian, conservative and Republican – in that order.” In a 2011 profile during Pence’s run for Indiana governor, noted state political columnist Brian Howey remarked, “Pence doesn’t just wear his faith on his sleeve, he wears the whole Jesus jersey.”It isn’t a characterization that Pence has shied away from. “My Christian faith is at the very heart of who I am,” Pence said during the 2016 vice presidential debate.Richard Land, former president of the Southern Baptist Convention’s Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission and current president of Southern Evangelical Seminary in Charlotte, told the Atlantic in 2018, “Mike Pence is the 24-karat-gold model of what we want in an evangelical politician. I don’t know anyone who’s more consistent in bringing his evangelical Christian worldview to public policy.” But as a scholar of U.S. religion and culture, I believe that Pence’s faith and political identities are more complex than these statements suggest. In fact, one can trace three distinct conversion experiences in his biography. Three-point conversionGrowing up in an Irish Catholic family with five siblings, working-class roots and Democratic political commitments, Pence attended Catholic school, served as an altar boy at his family’s church, idolized John F. Kennedy and was a youth coordinator for the local Democratic Party in his teens.It was as a freshman at Hanover College in 1978 that Pence experienced an evangelical conversion while attending a music festival in Kentucky billed as the “Christian Woodstock.”For some years afterward he remained active in the Catholic Church, attending Mass regularly, serving as a youth minister and seriously considering joining the priesthood. At the same time, he and his future wife Karen were part of a demographic shift of Americans who “had grown up Catholic and still loved many things about the Catholic Church, but also really loved the concept of having a very personal relationship with Christ,” as a close friend put it.By the mid-1990s he was a married father of three who identified as a “born-again, evangelical Catholic,” an unusual term that has caused some consternation among both evangelicals and Catholics.In subsequent interviews, Pence has spoken freely about how his 1978 conversion gave him a “personal relationship with Jesus Christ” that “changed everything.” But he has tended to avoid labeling his religious views when pressed, referring to himself as a “pretty ordinary Christian” who “cherishes his Catholic upbringing.” He has attended nondenominational evangelical churches with his family since at least 1995. Pence’s political conversion was more clear cut. Though he voted for Jimmy Carter in the 1980 presidential election, he quickly came to embrace Ronald Reagan’s economic and social conservatism and his populist appeal. In a 2016 speech at the Reagan Library, Pence credited Reagan with inspiring him to “leave the party of my youth and become a Republican like he did.” “His broad-shouldered leadership changed my life,” he said. Pence has frequently compared Trump to Reagan, arguing that they have the same “broad shoulders.”Pence ran unsuccessfully for Congress in 1988 and 1990, and the second bruising loss precipitated a third conversion, this time in political style. In a 1991 published essay titled “Confessions of a Negative Campaigner,” he described himself as a sinner and wrote of his “conversion” to the belief that “negative campaigning is wrong.” Between 1992 and 1999, Pence honed his blend of family values and fiscal conservatism in an eponymous conservative talk show.The show’s popularity provided a springboard to a successful run for Congress in 2000. During his six terms in the House, Pence acquired a reputation for “unalloyed traditional conservatism” and principled opposition to Republican Party leadership on issues like No Child Left Behind and Medicare prescription drug expansion. Religious actsIn addition to his “unsullied” reputation as a “culture warrior,” he also attracted attention for following the “Billy Graham Rule” of avoiding meeting with women alone and avoiding events where alcohol was served when his wife was not present. During the 2016 vice presidential debate, Pence said that his entire career in public service stems from a commitment to “live out” his religious beliefs, “however imperfectly.”One of those beliefs is his opposition to abortion, grounded in his reading of particular biblical passages. As a congressman in 2007, he was the first to sponsor legislation defunding Planned Parenthood, and did so repeatedly until the first defunding bill passed in 2011. “I long for the day when Roe v. Wade is sent to the ash heap of history,” he said at the time.In 2016, over the objections of many Republican state representatives, he signed the most restrictive set of anti-abortion measures in the country into law, making him a conservative hero. Among other things, the bill prevented women from terminating pregnancies for reasons including fetal disability such as Down syndrome. Although opponents succeeded in getting the bill overturned in the courts, Indiana is still seen as one of the most anti-abortion states in America.As vice president, Pence also cast the tie-breaking Senate vote to allow states to withhold federal family planning funds from Planned Parenthood in 2017.Pence has also been an outspoken opponent of LGBTQ rights. He opposed the inclusion of sexual orientation in hate crimes legislation and the end of the military’s “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” policy. He likewise supported both state and federal constitutional amendments to ban same-sex marriage, and expressed disappointment at the 2015 Obergefell decision, which required all states to recognize such unions.At the same time he has been a strong supporter of “religious freedom,” particularly for Christians.In March 2015, as Indiana governor, he signed the state’s Religious Freedom Restoration Act “to ensure that religious liberty is fully protected.” The act ignited a firestorm of nationwide controversy: Critics alleged that it would allow for individuals and businesses to legally discriminate against members of the LGBTQ community. Under pressure from LGBTQ activists, liberals, business owners and moderate Republicans, Pence signed an amendment a week later stipulating that it did not authorize discrimination. Staked reputationPence’s religious and political biography mirrors key political and religious shifts over the past 40 years, from the rise of the religious right and its growing influence in the Republican Party to the conservative coalition of evangelicals and Catholics across denominational lines, to the legacy of the “outsider” celebrity president.These threads converge in Mike Pence, whose “24-karat,” “unalloyed” conservative credentials were instrumental in rallying evangelical voters behind Trump in the 2016 election and who has staked his political future on continuing to defend him.This article is republished from The Conversation, a nonprofit news site dedicated to sharing ideas from academic experts.

Air fryers are surprisingly versatile. Their ability to make food crispy using little or no oil makes them ideal for adding flavor and crunch to a range of breakfast dishes.

Insider asked three professional chefs to share their favorite morning meals to cook in an air fryer.

Read on to find out their top suggestions.

Air-frying may be a shortcut to perfect bacon.

Chef Meredith Laurence of Blue Jean Chef told Insider that bacon and air fryers are a perfect match.

""There's no tidier way to cook bacon than in an air fryer,"" she said. ""The air fryer limits the splatter around your kitchen and makes the bacon crispy.""

You can air-fry it on a flat tray, but using a wire rack will allow the excess fat to drip away and may result in crispier bacon.

It's a great way to make mini egg frittatas.

Christina Stanco, executive chef at Central Kitchen and Bar in Detroit, told Insider that she loves making mini egg frittatas in the air fryer.

""Mini egg frittatas are quick and easy in the air fryer,"" she said. ""Just pour whisked eggs and diced peppers into cupcake papers, top with cheese, and air-fry.""

You can experiment with adding your own favorite toppings to the mini frittatas, like bacon bits or fresh herbs.

Breakfast burritos are the ultimate portable morning meal, and they're easy to make in the air fryer.

""Air-fryer breakfast burritos are a favorite of mine,"" Stanco told Insider. ""Just roll up scrambled eggs, sausage, and cheese into a flour tortilla and cook it in the air fryer.""

She suggested trying to avoid adding wet ingredients like salsa or sliced tomato before cooking as excess moisture may result in less crispy burritos.

French-toast sticks are usually a hit with kids.

French-toast sticks are a fun breakfast treat that you can throw together with common kitchen staples.

""Simply cut bread slices into fingers and then soak them in a French-toast egg mixture before coating them in crushed Corn Flakes or other cereal flakes,"" Laurence told Insider.

Air-fry the sticks at 400 degrees Fahrenheit for eight to nine minutes so they're crispy but not dry, and serve them with maple syrup or Greek yogurt and berries.

Cinnamon rolls are a sweet way to use the countertop appliance.

For a decadent morning treat, Laurence suggested baking a few cinnamon rolls in your air fryer.

""Roll out the dough, brush it with butter, and sprinkle cinnamon sugar on top,"" she said. ""After forming the rolls and letting them rise, pop them in the air fryer for 10 minutes at 350 degrees [Fahrenheit].""

You can use your own homemade dough or opt for a premade variety to save time.

Finish off the cinnamon rolls with a sweet glaze or cream-cheese frosting.

Air-fried home fries are a flavorful breakfast side.

Home fries are seasoned and fried potato chunks often served alongside eggs or meat at breakfast.

""Home fries are a must in the air fryer,"" Stanco told Insider. ""Be sure to season the chopped potatoes with herbs and spices before cooking them.""

She suggested using a ""floury"" variety of potato, such as an Idaho russet, for the best texture and flavor.

Eggs in a basket are a fun and easy breakfast dish to try.

Eggs in a basket — also known as egg in a hole — is a quick breakfast dish that looks a lot fancier than it is.

""You can make 'eggs in a basket' very easily in the air fryer by making indentations in a few slices of bread, cracking eggs into the indents, and air frying,"" Laurence said.

The chef recommended cooking the eggs for five to seven minutes at about 380 degrees Fahrenheit.

For a twist on this recipe, swap the slices of toast for hollowed-out bread rolls.

Breakfast sausages cook up nicely in an air fryer.

Using an air fryer to cook your breakfast sausages can help you avoid excess fat and grease.

""Placing the sausages in a perforated or mesh basket allows the fat to drip away, helping them crisp up faster,"" Laurence told Insider.

You can also use an air fryer to add a bit of extra crispiness to vegetarian or vegan sausages. The plant-based varieties usually have less fat, so give them a light spray of oil before air-frying.

Switch things up with some sweet-potato fries for breakfast.

Chef Hayato Yoshida, cofounder of Wagyu Beef, told Insider that an air fryer can easily turn sweet potatoes into a tasty morning meal.

""Instead of throwing them in the oven or microwave — which might make them soggy — put them in the air fryer instead,"" he said.

You can also shred your sweet potatoes and air-fry them as hash browns or nests.

Doughnuts are surprisingly easy to make right at home.

Skip the line at the coffee shop and make your own fresh doughnuts at home.

""Instead of going through the hassle of deep-frying, consider air-frying a couple of fluffy doughnuts,"" Yoshida told Insider. ""They're delicious and will definitely help satisfy your morning sweet tooth.""

Try using canned biscuit dough shaped or cut into rings if you're short on time.

You can add a glaze to your doughnuts by dipping them in a mixture of powdered sugar and water or milk, but be sure to wait until they've fully cooled before glazing.

Air-fried egg rolls are a quick and portable breakfast.

If you're looking to break out of a breakfast rut, consider using an air fryer to make breakfast egg rolls.

""Breakfast egg rolls are a great handheld breakfast option for those on the move,"" Yoshida told Insider. ""I love air-frying egg rolls and enjoying them as a treat in the morning.""

To make them, scramble eggs with your choice of chopped vegetables or meats, portion the mixture into egg-roll wrappers, fold and roll them up, and air-fry until golden.

"In dueling election-eve rallies, Biden and Trump stump for Georgia Senate candidates","President-elect Joe Biden elbow-bumps one Democratic Senate candidate, Jon Ossoff, as another, Raphael Warnock, looks on Monday during a campaign rally in Atlanta. (Associated Press)

On the eve of a special election that will shape the course of Joe Biden’s presidency, he and President Trump engaged in one final campaign battle in Georgia on Monday, appealing to voters across the state who will decide which of their parties controls the Senate.

Their dueling rallies come as Georgians neared Tuesday's final chance to cast ballots in two special elections for Senate seats currently controlled by Republican incumbents David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler. If either of them wins, the GOP will continue to control the chamber by a slim margin, empowered to stymie Biden's policy agenda and potentially block confirmation of his appointees.

Both Democrats must win in upsets to produce a 50-50 Senate split that would make Kamala Harris, as vice president, the tiebreaker and give their party control.

Trump, holding the likely final rally of his presidency in rural Dalton, struggled to articulate the stakes for Republicans while holding on to the fantasy that he will remain in office after Jan. 20.

""These Senate seats are truly the last line of defense,"" the president said, before quickly qualifying the comment — because Democrats could control a 50-50 Senate only by occupying the White House. ""I don't concede,"" he added.

Trump's deep denial was clear from the moment he stepped to the lectern, declaring ""there's no way we lost Georgia"" and accusing Democrats of ""trying to steal the White House.""

He repeatedly urged his supporters to vote on Tuesday, a request potentially undercut by what was, on the whole, an unapologetically authoritarian and fact-challenged diatribe attacking the democratic process itself. Trump offered several debunked conspiracy theories of election fraud and complained about the Supreme Court ""not stepping up to the plate,"" as well as his less than total backing from Republican lawmakers, whom he implicitly threatened ahead of Congress' electoral college certification on Wednesday.

Story continues

""People will remember the people who don't support us,"" he said, while publicly pressuring Vice President Mike Pence, who must oversee the final authorization by Congress, to undo the result.

""I hope Mike Pence comes through for us,"" Trump said. ""If he doesn't come through, I won't like him quite as much.""

The unusual special election had long seemed to favor the Republicans but was considered a toss-up by the last hours; heavy early voting seemed to favor Democrats. Trump's attacks on the November election results — and on his own party’s leaders in Georgia for validating Biden's victory there — were threatening to undermine Republicans' chances of holding the Senate.

In a sharp contrast to Trump, whose latest loyalty test continued to splinter his party, Biden delivered a more forward-looking appeal to a broader coalition, imploring Georgians to turn out for Democrats Jon Ossoff and the Rev. Raphael Warnock during a late afternoon rally in Atlanta.

""The power is literally in your hands. Unlike any time in my career, one state can chart the course not just for the next four years, but for a generation.""

Biden stressed that his ability to follow through on plans for confronting the pandemic hinges on what Georgians decide, and he promised that the $2,000 relief payment that congressional Democrats unsuccessfully sought would become a reality if Ossoff and Warnock prevail.

Shortly before Biden took the stage before hundreds of cars at a drive-in rally near the 1996 Olympic torch, an official from the office of Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger sharply and publicly rebuked Trump for his brazen effort to bully Raffensperger into overturning the will of Georgia voters, who narrowly favored Biden in the November election. The news conference by Gabriel Sterling, the Republican who oversees Georgia’s voting systems, came the day after the leak of an extraordinary one-hour phone call Saturday in which Trump urged Raffenspergerto find enough votes for him to nullify Biden’s win.

One by one, Sterling angrily debunked the president's conspiracy theories alleging fraud in the Georgia election two months ago, and he condemned Trump's pitch to reverse the result. ""Every one of these claims is false, and yet the president persists,"" he said.

The president’s request, recorded by Raffensperger's office and shared with journalists, moved some Democrats in Congress to call for a criminal investigation. And it had the four Senate campaigns scrambling to assess the impact on the special election. Republicans worried that the president’s repeated false claims that November’s election in Georgia was fixed would convince them it wasn’t worth their effort to cast ballots.

Raffensperger told NBC News that he didn't know how the recording of his call with Trump was leaked but said, ""We’re better for it.”

""Now everyone can listen to the whole one-hour, eight-minute call with the president. But at the end of the day, what he said was not factually correct. And I want to make sure that people understand the facts,” Raffensperger said, adding, ""You can't keep on taking shots from people and people keep putting out stuff that's not true. And we're going to respond.”

Perdue tore into Raffensperger for recording the call, saying on Fox News that it was a ""disgusting"" move.

""I guess I was raised differently,"" said the senator, who is in quarantine after exposure to COVID-19 and planned to appear ""virtually"" at the Trump rally in Dalton. “To have a statewide elected official, regardless of party, tape without disclosing a conversation — private conversation — with the president of the United States, and then leaking it to the press is disgusting.”

But Sterling made no apologies, telling reporters that the president routinely misrepresented conversations after the fact, and that it was appropriate for Raffensperger to create a record of what was actually said.

Trump bashed Raffensperger and Gov. Brian Kemp several times during his 80-minute stemwinder, even vowing to return next year to campaign against them.

Biden and many Democrats proceeded cautiously. Some in Congress argued against continuing to focus on holding Trump accountable just weeks before he is to leave office. After the Democrats’ disappointing showing in November in races for Congress and state offices, some worried that moving to punish the president would alienate swing voters who want to move on from Trump, as Biden has promised, rather than see his party try to exact political revenge.

At the rally, Biden did not mention Trump’s call to Raffensperger. He instead referred more vaguely to the president’s general efforts to subvert the election outcome, and to his demands of complete loyalty from senators like Loeffler and Perdue as he pursues baseless claims of fraud.

“You have two senators who think they have sworn an oath to Trump, not to the United States Constitution,” Biden said. He added, reflecting on his own time in the Senate, “Not once did I think I took an oath to any president, Democrat or Republican. I took an oath to the United States Constitution.”

“Politicians cannot assert, take or seize power,” Biden said. ""Power is given, granted by the American people alone. We can never give that up. It is always the will of the people who must prevail.”

"Trump Goes Down Screaming About Pence, Vowing to Primary Traitors","Jim Bourg/Reuters

In a delusional last-ditch effort to secure a second term, President Donald Trump tore his own party to shreds on Wednesday, pinning all hopes on a VP who has no political power to do anything and vowing to demolish any Republican who opposes him.

“You have to get your people to fight and if they don’t fight we have to primary the hell out of the ones that don’t fight. We’re going to let you know who they are,” Trump said in a rambling speech to a large rally in D.C. held on Wednesday to coincide with Congress officially counting the Electoral College votes.

“It almost seems like they're going out of their way to hurt all of us and to hurt our country,” he added about the elected officials.

But, as he was speaking, Vice President Mike Pence released a lengthy statement saying he could not, and would not, block President-elect Joe Biden’s Electoral College votes on Wednesday—essentially dooming Trump’s last fantasy-driven path to winning the presidency.

Through a chorus of “bullshits” from the crowd of MAGA die-hards, Trump slammed the “pathetic” and “weak” Republican establishment, taking jabs at Sen. Mitt Romney, who said on Wednesday morning that Trump had “disgraced the office of the presidency” and essentially caused run-off losses in Georgia by insisting that the election was rigged.

He took shots at Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, whose state’s run-off results on Tuesday put Democrats within reach of a Senate majority.

Trump asked the crowd to vote Kemp “the hell out of office, please,” before claiming that Kemp’s approval ratings had “reached a record low” as one of the “dumbest governors in the country.”

MAGA Die-Hards Rally in D.C. in Flailing Last-Ditch Bid to Undo Trump’s Election Loss

Trump’s decision to twist the knife in further on the GOP came just moments before Congress was set to count the Electoral College votes from all 50 states and D.C. in the final step to certifying the next president.

At least 12 Republican senators have signaled their intention to object to their state’s votes, which will trigger hours of debate but is almost guaranteed to have no impact on the election result. Pence then certifies the result in a largely ceremonial act.

The objections are also seemingly for show. Electors officially cast their votes on Dec. 14, and Biden defeated Trump by 306-232 a month prior. Biden is now set to be inaugurated on Jan. 20.

“You will have a president...who was voted on by stupid people,” Trump said in a slam to 81 million Biden voters.

Although Pence has no power to flip the Electoral College votes, Trump has mounted an extraordinary campaign to scapegoat his VP for his loss, prompting some extreme right-wing Trumpists like Georgia lawyer L. Lin Wood to call for Pence to be charged with treason.

“Mike Pence is going to have to come through for us and if he doesn't that will be a sad day for our country, because you’re sworn to uphold our Constitution,” Trump said.

He once again baselessly insisted that Pence has the power to challenge the election result, stating that “one of the top constitutional lawyers in our country” told him his VP has “the absolute right to.”

“All that Vice President Pence has to do is send it back to the states to re-certify, and we become president, and you are the happiest people,” Trump insisted, claiming he had just spoken to Pence.

In his statement, meanwhile, Pence declared he does not believe he has the “unilateral authority to decide which electoral votes should be counted.”

“It is my considered judgment that my oath to support and defend the Constitution constrains me from claiming unilateral authority to determine which electoral votes should be counted and which should not,” Pence said.

Trump later responded on Twitter, writing that Pence “didn’t have the courage to do what should have been done to protect our Country and our Constitution...USA demands the truth!”

Despite Trump’s incessant crusade, election officials have insisted there was no evidence of widespread voter fraud. Former Attorney General Bill Barr also concluded there were no misdeeds that could have changed the outcome of the election.

Trump’s mind, however, cannot be swayed. He called out Barr on Wednesday for “changing” and insisted Congress “show strength” by overthrowing the election results because they are “rigged.”

“You'll never take back our country with weakness,” Trump said.

As Trump concluded his hour-long speech, encouraging attendees to “walk down Pennsylvania Avenue,” some of the president’s supporters were already stoking chaos on the Capitol lawn. A crowd breached barricades and crossed into the lawn while others began to throw objects and attempt to enter the building.

The Democrat Jon Ossoff has won his Senate runoff election in Georgia against the Republican Sen. David Perdue, as Decision Desk HQ and Insider projected early Wednesday.

This makes Ossoff, 33, the youngest Democratic senator-elect since Joe Biden in 1973.

Biden, the 78-year-old president-elect, won his first Senate seat in Delaware at the age of 30.

Ossoff is also the first millennial to be elected to the Senate. The youngest incumbent senator had been Sen. Josh Hawley, a 41-year-old Missouri Republican.

Jon Ossoff has become the youngest Democrat to be elected as a US senator since Joe Biden in 1973.

Ossoff, 33, unseated incumbent Republican Sen. David Perdue in one of two runoff elections in Georgia, according to a projection early Wednesday by Decision Desk HQ and Insider.

Ossoff is also the first millennial to be elected to the Senate. The youngest sitting US senator is the Missouri Republican Josh Hawley, who is 41.

Ossoff previously worked as a US House staffer and is the CEO of an investigative-documentary company.

A series of Ossoff's old tweets unearthed by Slate, with subjects ranging from the video game franchise ""Grand Theft Auto"" to the rapper Lil Jon, attest to his credentials as a child of the internet age.

""N00b 4 lyfe,"" Ossoff tweeted in April 2014. The year before, he tweeted: ""Shouldn't autocorrect know 'crunkest' is a word?""

The last time a Democratic candidate as young as Ossoff won a Senate seat was in 1973, when a 30-year-old Biden defeated Republican Sen. J. Caleb Boggs to represent Delaware. Biden, now 78, is set to be inaugurated as the US president on January 20.

The youngest person ever elected to the Senate was John Henry Eaton, who was 28 when he was elected to represent Tennessee in November 1818.

The minimum age to be elected as a US senator is 30, according the US Constitution, but officials apparently forgot to ask Eaton how old he was.

Runoff elections were called in Georgia after no candidate in either Senate race secured more than the required 50% of the vote in the November 3 general election.

The Rev. Raphael Warnock, the other Democrat running for a Senate seat in Georgia, defeated Republican Sen. Kelly Loeffler, according to an earlier projection by Decision Desk HQ and Insider.

Warnock is the first Black man in Georgia to be elected as a US senator, and his victory brought an end to the 24-year losing streak for Democratic Senate candidates in the state.

In a Tuesday-night speech - in which he all but declared victory - Warnock paid special thanks to his mother, Verlene.

""The other day, because this is America, the 82-year-old hands that used to pick somebody else's cotton went to the polls and picked her youngest son to be a United States senator,"" Warnock said.

Wins for Warnock and Ossoff mean the Democratic Party now controls both the House of Representatives and the Senate.

"Italy received 100,000 fewer doses of Pfizer","Jens Spahn, German health minister, attends a federal cabinet meeting at the Chancellery in Berlin on January 6. Clemens Bilan/Pool/Getty Images

German Health Minister Jens Spahn has asked people in the country to be patient over the speed of the coronavirus vaccine rollout.

Spahn, speaking at a press conference Wednesday, said the first step was to get all those needing care and the oldest in the country vaccinated.

He said almost 400,000 people in Germany had so far been vaccinated.

Figures from the Robert Koch Institute, the national agency for disease control and prevention, show that 367,331 vaccinations have been administered, with 150,000 in nursing homes and around 176,000 medical staff getting the shot.

Germany lags behind the UK, which has vaccinated around 1.3 million people as of Tuesday. But it is ahead of France, which has also attracted criticism over a slow start to its vaccination rollout, administering 516 shots by January 1. The country has since significantly ramped up its rollout, with more than 5,000 doses given on January 5, according to its health minister. Italy has so far administered nearly 250,000 inoculations.

Spahn added that these were days of confidence for Germany.

But he also said he understood impatience in the population.

The truth is that the vaccine is a scarce good worldwide,” he said.

“That is why we have to ask large parts of the population for patience,” Spahn said, explaining that the situation was no different in the wider European Union or beyond.

Spahn said the reason for the rollout speed was due to limited production capacity.

The good news: There will be enough vaccine in Germany,"" he said.

Spahn said the hope was to be able to offer a vaccine to everyone in the summer.

“Today we expect a second authorization for the Moderna vaccine,” he said, referring to a pending European Medicines Agency decision on the Moderna vaccine Wednesday.

“We are hoping that the delivery of Moderna vaccines starts early next week.""","['Zamira Rahim', 'Angela Dewan', 'Hannah Strange']",https://news.google.com,high
"Israel offers aggressive COVID-19 vaccine rollout, but Palestinians left behind","Israel is far outstripping other countries in vaccinating its population against COVID-19, an extraordinary achievement hailed by public health experts at home and abroad, and one that could propel it toward coveted herd immunity more rapidly than almost any nation.

But Israel is also under criticism for leaving behind the nearly 5 million Palestinians under its control in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, who are expected to wait considerably longer for mass inoculation.

In less than three weeks, Israel has vaccinated almost 15% of its 9.3 million people with the first of two doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, dramatically outpacing the rollout in the United States and much of Europe, in terms of population size. By comparison, the U.S. rate hovers below 1.5%, according to data compiled by an Oxford University vaccination-tracking site.

With vaccines being administered to more than 150,000 people a day in Israel, those groups that have been given priority to be inoculated — healthcare workers and citizens over age 60 — are expected to receive their second shots by late January, even as the country battles a ferocious new wave of infections.

The much-vaunted vaccine rollout may allow Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, running for reelection while on trial for bribery, fraud and breach of trust, to improve his faltering poll numbers and turn aside harsh criticism of his overall management of the pandemic response. The prime minister was the first in the country to receive the vaccine, baring his arm on live television last month and encouraging others to get the shot.

With a March election on the horizon, the vaccine campaign’s initial effectiveness is already giving Netanyahu a chance to hold out the prospect of a speedier economic recovery. On Monday, the Bank of Israel issued an improved assessment of the nation’s 2021 outlook, foreseeing the economy shrinking by less than 4%, instead of its initial estimate of 6%, if the rapid pace of inoculation is maintained.

Along with Israel’s small size and its tech-savvy ways, the country’s long-established, highly digitized national healthcare system is being given much of the credit for the early rollout success. By law, every Israeli citizen must register with one of four health maintenance organizations, which are heavily subsidized by the government.

Public health, from early childhood vaccinations to eldercare, is based on a network of community clinics present in almost every Israeli locality. This socialized system has decades of experience with outreach and logistics, and there is an existing national vaccine registry, initially set up to track common childhood inoculations.

Another key factor in the initial vaccine triumph has been aggressive procurement. When Pfizer became the first maker to certify the efficacy of its vaccine, Israel was reported to have paid up to double the price paid by European countries, and up to three times the price paid by the United States, to secure delivery of an estimated 8 million initial doses.

Netanyahu’s administration also secured preliminary agreements with vaccine makers Moderna and AstraZeneca, with the first doses of the Moderna vaccine expected to begin arriving within two weeks.

Israel’s high-speed, high-efficiency vaccine regimen does not extend to the occupied West Bank, however, where about 3 million Palestinians live, or to the Gaza Strip, home to an additional 2 million Palestinians, which is blockaded by Israel and Egypt.

Israel rejects the position espoused by some aid groups that it is responsible for civilian populations under its control, saying that 1990s peace accords place the onus for providing healthcare, even in a public health emergency, on Palestinian officials.

A consortium of 15 Israeli and Palestinian human rights organizations has called on Israel to ensure that vaccines that meet the rigorous standards of the Israeli health system be procured and delivered to Palestinian lands as soon as possible.

Israeli officials have said some leftover vaccine doses may be donated, but there are no formal plans in place. Health Minister Yuli Edelstein said Israel’s first responsibility is to its own citizens, but some argued it bore additional moral and perhaps legal responsibility.

“I am so proud of how well our HMOs have provided vaccinations to Israelis, including the Palestinian citizens of Israel and residents of occupied East Jerusalem,” Israeli lawyer and activist Daniel Seidemann said in an online posting. At the same time, he said, “I am so ashamed of how we’ve failed to provide vaccinations to the Palestinians we occupy in the West Bank and Gaza.”

Palestinian Arab citizens of Israel, who make up about one-fifth of the population, are included in the national vaccination drive. Netanyahu and other officials traveled on New Year’s Day to the predominantly Arab town of Umm al Fahm, in northern Israel, for a news conference marking the millionth vaccination.

Jewish settlers living in the West Bank are receiving vaccines as part of the Israeli government push, while Palestinians in neighboring villages are not. Palestinian officials hope to begin providing some vaccinations next month, though the effort is likely to be far slower than on the Israeli side.

A few West Bank Palestinians who work across the line are receiving the vaccine. Walid Nammour, the chief executive officer of Augusta Victoria, one of East Jerusalem’s six main hospitals, said that 70% of his staff would be vaccinated by Thursday. Of those, he said, 9 in 10 are from the West Bank.

Nammour described the Israeli approach as shortsighted, because so many Israelis and Palestinians live or work in close proximity.

“It doesn’t help Israel, because if everyone in Israel is vaccinated and Palestinians in the West Bank are not, the pandemic will not be controlled,” he said.

Coinciding with its rapid vaccine rollout, Israel is facing tight new restrictions aimed at stemming what has become a massive new outbreak of coronavirus cases. The number of infections in Israel has surpassed 450,000, with more than 3,400 deaths.

The government is poised to approve a fourth national lockdown, which will keep people in their homes, shut schools and workplaces and once again paralyze the economy. Complicating matters, Israel has identified more than 30 cases of individuals infected by the potentially more contagious strain of the coronavirus first identified in Britain.

“The rate of contagion is catastrophic,” said Edelstein, the health minister.

Some experts, though, said fear of contracting the virus could help dispel any lingering doubts among vaccine skeptics, paradoxically boosting the inoculation drive.

“When infection is high, people are motivated to get the vaccines,” said Dr. Hagai Levine, a Hebrew University epidemiologist and chairman of the Israeli Assn. of Public Health Physicians. “Less people fall into thinking, ‘It won’t happen to me.’”

Pro-Trump mob storms US Capitol as armed standoff takes place outside House chamber,"(CNN) Supporters of President Donald Trump have breached the US Capitol and one woman has been shot as one of the most iconic American buildings is engulfed in chaos after Trump urged his supporters to fight against the ceremonial counting of the electoral votes that confirmed President-elect Joe Biden's win.

Shortly after 1 p.m. ET hundreds of pro-Trump protesters pushed through barriers set up along the perimeter of the Capitol, where they tussled with officers in full riot gear, some calling the officers ""traitors"" for doing their jobs. About 90 minutes later, police said demonstrators got into the building and the doors to the House and Senate were being locked. Shortly after, the House floor was evacuated by police.

An armed standoff was taking place at the House front door as of 3 p.m. ET, and police officers had their guns drawn at someone who is trying to breach it. A Trump supporter was also pictured standing at the Senate dais.

A woman is in critical condition after being shot in the chest on the Capitol grounds, according to two sources familiar with the matter. The sources could not provide further details on the circumstances of the shooting.

The Senate floor was cleared of rioters as of 3:30 p.m. ET, and an officer told CNN that they have successfully squeezed them away from the Senate wing of the building and towards the Rotunda, and they are removing them out of the East and West doors of the Capitol.

Some Florida counties turned to Eventbrite to distribute vaccines. Then the fraudulent listings came,"(CNN Business) Before the pandemic, Meg Bourbonniere used Eventbrite to purchase concert tickets. But this week, the 65-year-old resident of Pinellas County, Florida, logged on to the online ticketing platform for a very different purpose: to try to secure an appointment to get the Covid-19 vaccine.

Several counties in Florida have turned to Eventbrite, a service better known for reserving spots for conferences, sporting events and a range of personal gatherings, to help distribute vaccines to residents. After hearing about such an effort in Sarasota County, Bourbonniere searched for and found similar vaccine signups in her own county on Eventbrite. But there was a problem: her county wasn't actually among those using the platform for registrations.

""I found the Sarasota site and I used the location button to get to events near me,"" said Bourbonniere, who told CNN Business that she came across numerous listings in Clearwater, Florida, a city in Pinellas County. She then tweeted at the Florida Department of Health in Pinellas County to ask why there were ""74 Eventbrite listings for Covid vaccine"" in Clearwater, many of which were sold out, despite conflicting information on the county website.

The Pinellas Department of Health replied that it had not used Eventbrite's platform for vaccine distribution. ""Someone created a FAKE Eventbrite account to register for the COVID-19 vaccination,"" the Department tweeted hours later. ""You should NOT be charged to register. Registration is FREE,"" it said, including information about how to register through its website and by phone.

The Pinellas County Sheriff's Office told CNN Business it is currently looking at the fraudulent use of Eventbrite for COVID vaccinations in Pinellas County, adding that the pages appear to have been taken down.

In a statement to CNN Business, a spokesperson for Eventbrite said: ""We are actively exploring how our platform can best support the effort to increase access to vaccines. We are aware of unofficial vaccine event listings on Eventbrite. We believe these events were created in error and have removed them from our site. We are continuously monitoring and taking appropriate action.""

When asked why Eventbrite believed the events were created in error and how many it removed from its site, the spokesperson declined to comment beyond the statement.

Pasco, Eventbrite EB In the absence of a national or statewide distribution plan, several counties in Florida, including Sarasota Collier, and Manatee , have leveragedto distribute their limited number of vaccine doses on a first come, first serve basis to eligible groups of people. This includes residents who are 65 years or older.

But the patchwork approach to vaccine distribution in Florida appears to have created an opportunity for bad actors to scam residents with fraudulent health department listings, both in locations that are using Eventbrite for vaccine distribution and in areas that are not. It is unclear who is behind the listings and what the motives are. But at the very least it only adds potential for greater misinformation and confusion about the vaccines and their distribution.

The Florida Governor's Office and the Florida Department of Health did not respond to CNN Business' requests for comment.

Like other online platforms, Eventbrite has long had to contend with bad actors attempting to mislead users. When Eventbrite prepared to go public in 2018, the company warned in its IPO paperwork that ""we have experienced fraudulent activity on our platform in the past, including fake events in which a person sells tickets to an event but does not intend to hold an event or fulfill the ticket.""

At least three of the counties that are using Eventbrite for vaccine distribution -- Pasco, Collier, and Sarasota -- have recently acknowledged scams on the platform.

According to Chase Daniels, executive director at Pasco Sheriff's Office, it is ""working approximately one dozen complaints sent to us by the Department of Health- Pasco County regarding fake pages that are providing fake vouchers to individuals,"" while stressing that there was no exchange of money. ""The investigation into those fake vouchers are still ongoing,"" said Daniels.

On Tuesday, Collier County's Department of Health put out a press release stating it is aware of Eventbrite scams throughout the state. It reminded people that it is not asking for Social Security numbers, credit card information, or bank information, nor is it charging for the vaccine.

While the Sarasota County government warned of vaccine scams Tuesday, a spokesperson for the county's Department of Health said he had not heard about Eventbrite scams happening in Sarasota itself. CNN Business reached out to several other counties that are legitimately using the platform for vaccine distribution to inquire about any reports of scams, but did not immediately hear back.

Apart from concerns about fraudulent listings, some Florida residents, including older residents who may be less tech literate, are now left to navigate the digital ticketing platform in the hopes of landing one of the limited number of vaccination spots available.

After Khalid El Khatib's 77-year-old father was unable to secure a vaccine appointment through Eventbrite in Sarasota, it became a family affair. El Khatib told CNN Business that he and his two sisters signed up for notifications on Eventbrite in the hopes that between the four of them, one would be able to score an appointment when the next distribution wave opened.

El Khatib compared it to how you might try to land tickets for ""a popular concert,"" except with much more at stake.

Not everyone is fortunate enough to have tech-savvy relatives to help. Nancy Morrow-Howell, director of the Harvey A. Friedman Center for Aging at Washington University in St. Louis, points out that platforms like Eventbrite are inaccessible to ""the most disadvantaged people."" When combined with the first come, first serve approach being taken in Florida, it only further complicates who gets early access to the vaccine, and accurate information about it.

""The only way I am able to get information is by being an educated, young, and relatively connected New Yorker,"" El Khatib said, speaking broadly about coronavirus safety measures. ""I think it speaks to the inequity that is surfacing through every stage of this pandemic.""

Bourbonniere, a retired doctoral-level nurse, who specialized in geriatrics, described herself and her 68-year-old husband, a retired engineer with a chronic health condition, as pretty tech savvy. But within the 65+ community where she lives, Bourbonniere said there have been mixed messages about how to register for the vaccine, potentially confusing residents who are both more vulnerable to Covid and more vulnerable to misinformation about it.

""That's what worries me,"" she said.","[""Sara Ashley O'Brien"", 'Cnn Business']",https://news.google.com,high
L.A. officials allowed dozens without medical credentials to get COVID-19 vaccine early,"Los Angeles County’s vaccine distribution effort hit a rocky patch this week, as officials administering Moderna shots at pop-up sites allowed some people who are not healthcare workers to skip the line and get immunized weeks or months before they are eligible.

Crowds of desperate people seeking early access to the vaccine led to longer lines and headaches for workers at four sites run by the city of Los Angeles set up to provide doses exclusively for healthcare employees.

But at one South L.A. vaccination site, a Times reporter watched as about 100 people were admitted for immunizations without showing proof that they worked in the healthcare industry. One woman said she received the vaccine at Hansen Dam Recreation Area in Pacoima even after telling workers she was not a healthcare employee.

By Tuesday, officials appeared to have closed that loophole, requiring a photo ID and documentation of a job in the healthcare industry in order to receive a dose of the vaccine.

Many of the people who were turned away were seniors, some with health conditions that place them at a higher risk of getting seriously ill or dying from COVID-19, said Richard Dang, the USC pharmacist overseeing the immunizations at a site in Lincoln Heights.

“It’s been a major issue,” he said. “It’s been tough.”

While the elderly and those with underlying health conditions are expected to be among the first vaccinated, the precise timing of when the doses will be administered is unclear. For some, it could take months.

At a city vaccination site at the Crenshaw Christian Center in South L.A. on Tuesday, a Los Angeles Fire Department employee turned away about half the people in line for not having proof of employment in the healthcare industry: a photo ID plus a work badge, pay stub, professional license or copy of a signed letter from an employer on official letterhead.

“There’s a gross amount of fraud,” the employee told a woman in scrubs, who had proof she was a healthcare worker, as she checked in for her appointment. “We have people throwing street temper tantrums because they’re not getting their way, and it’s worked for them in the past.”

Public health officials began offering the vaccine to healthcare workers at three COVID-19 testing sites last week and added a fourth this week.

Word spread quickly by text and email that no one was verifying healthcare credentials at some locations. By Monday, dozens of people were showing up at the city sites in Pacoima, Lincoln Heights, South L.A. and the San Fernando Recreation Park in hopes of getting an early dose of the vaccine.

Emails intended for healthcare workers were forwarded multiple times among friends and family, allowing anyone who received a registration link to sign up without showing proof of employment. One message shared with The Times included the warning: “Please note that these links are NOT for distribution.”

“Emails, family text groups … word got out,” Dang said.

It’s unclear how many people who were not eligible for the vaccine managed to get it. Those who jumped the line included a retired lawyer, a fashion industry worker and a real estate investor, Times reporters found.

On Monday morning, a crowd of people showed up for appointments in Lincoln Heights who were not eligible to receive the shot, Dang said. That had not been a problem during the site’s first two days of operation, he added.

Staff members at the city’s four vaccination sites are trained to make sure patients are eligible for early immunization under local, state and federal guidelines, said Andrea Garcia, a spokeswoman for Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti. Every patient is screened using a website that is jointly operated by the county and state, she said.

However, she said in an email, “this is a new operation and we are working together to improve our process and address any issues that arise.”

At the Lincoln Heights clinic on Tuesday, one elderly man who would not give his name refused to leave after a worker turned him away. He repeatedly told her he had a lung condition and a signed note from his doctor that qualified him for an early vaccine. Growing increasingly distressed, he yelled, “You have to help me!”

“I would love to vaccinate you today, but I can’t,” she told him. “I wish I could help.”

He eventually left, disappointed.

At the Crenshaw Christian Center, security was far more lax Monday. A Times reporter watched as one woman received the Moderna vaccine and about 100 others were admitted for shots without being asked for healthcare credentials.

The woman, who asked that her name not be used and said she is a single mother of two who works in the fashion industry, received an email originally sent to the head of a medical supply company that had been forwarded several times.

“Guys use link below and sign up ASAP for vaccine,” wrote one person who forwarded the message. “I just got appointment for my parents.”

The woman said she was initially angry that people were taking advantage but eventually decided that the system was “releasing appointment times” as front-line workers did not show up for their vaccines.

“Once it became a real, tangible option, I couldn’t not take the opportunity to protect myself from severe illness,” she said. “Once I was in line, I felt guilt that it wasn’t my turn but also aware that if it wasn’t me to get this dose, it would be someone else.”

She registered for a vaccine at about 2 p.m. Monday and was given a slot at 3:45 p.m. the same day. The registration page said the vaccinations were for “HEALTH STAFF ONLY,” but the woman said she was not asked to provide proof of her occupation. She uploaded her insurance information, and the site said the insurance company would be billed directly. She was not prompted to pay.

The vaccination site was in a corner of the Crenshaw Christian Center’s expansive parking lot. At 3:15 p.m., when the woman arrived, roughly 100 people stood in line outside the parking lot, and about 100 more fell in behind her. Many were elderly. The reporter did not observe any of the people ahead of the woman being turned away.

After waiting an hour, the woman showed her driver’s license to confirm her appointment. Then she entered one of a few open-sided canopy tents, where nurses wearing employee tags from Curative, a COVID-19 testing startup, were administering vaccines. A nurse told her she was receiving the Moderna vaccine and would get an email to schedule the second dose. Then she was given the shot.

Parked amid the tents was a large van emblazoned with the Curative logo, its back doors open, revealing a stock of supplies. Next to it was a Los Angeles Fire Department ambulance in which two paramedics sat filling syringes with vaccine. A pile of what appeared to be several dozen filled syringes lay on the gurney between them.

By the time the woman left, a man in an LAFD uniform was standing at the front of the line, requiring people to show proof they were health workers. He held a crumpled notice about the vaccination effort that listed the acceptable types of proof of profession. He started turning people away; of 20 people observed, only a handful were allowed in.

At Hansen Dam in Pacoima, a single line of cars snaked for about a mile outside the site as people waited for both testing and vaccines.

Eleanor Mizrahi, 76, showed up Tuesday after making a vaccine appointment through the online public health portal. She said her daughter, a healthcare worker, forwarded her an email with links to sign up. When Mizrahi registered, she was asked whether she worked in healthcare and clicked “no” but was still able to get an appointment.

“I thought, ‘Maybe they’re being liberal about it.’ I did have a degree of trepidation about doing it, because I certainly don’t want to take anything away from someone who needs it,” she said. “But my husband and I are both cancer survivors. We recently found out my immune system is quite compromised.”

But when Mizrahi and her husband checked in for their appointments, a site worker turned them away because they did not qualify.

“We’re not angry, and we’re not upset,” she said. “I just think they need to readjust the website to not allow you to go through if you’re not on the correct tier. That was the error that they made.”

If Mizrahi had come a day earlier, she might have been successful. Her friend, an 83-year-old retired lawyer who did not want to be named, got the vaccine at the same site after signing up through the public health portal.

The friend, who said she has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, said she was asked twice — once during online registration and again in person at the site — whether she was a healthcare worker and said “no” both times. At the site, she said, she told workers about her age and condition, and they gave her the Moderna vaccine.

“I did not say anything that was untrue, and I didn’t hold myself out as anything that I wasn’t,” she said. “I was simply an old lady with a breathing disorder, and they said, ‘OK, we’ll shoot you up!’”

Death row inmate Lisa Montgomery appeals to Trump to stop pending execution,"With less than a week to go before her scheduled execution at the Federal Correctional Complex in Terre Haute, Indiana, on Jan. 12, attorneys for Lisa Montgomery are pleading with President Trump to agree to her clemency petition and save her life.

Montgomery's Tennessee-based lawyer, Kelley Henry, stressed to Fox News on Wednesday that they are not in any way requesting the 52-year-old have her sentenced commuted, but to take the fast-approaching death sentence off the table in favor of life behind bars without parole.

From their purview, Trump ""can be a hero"" by making a ""very public statement about the importance of ending the stigmatization of mental illness.""

""Our country has long recognized that mental illness is a mitigating factor and calls for a lesser punishment,"" the executive clemency petition states.

Montgomery, who was convicted of murder and fetal abduction by a Missouri jury in 2008, was initially slated to be put to death on Dec. 8. The Department of Justice's Federal Bureau of Prisons rescheduled the date to Jan. 12 after her attorneys contracted the novel coronavirus following a visit to her Texas jail.

WHO IS LISA MONTGOMERY, THE ONLY WOMAN ON DEATH ROW IN THE US?

Then on Christmas Eve, a federal district court ruled that the government acted illegally in setting the Jan. 12 execution date because the government's own regulations prevent the setting of an execution date while a stay is in effect. The government subsequently appealed that decision and a three-judge panel reversed the district court.

Montgomery's legal team appealed to the full United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia and that appeal was denied on Jan. 5, 2021.

Montgomery was convicted of killing Bobbie Jo Stinnett, a 23-year-old dog breeder, on Dec. 16, 2004.

The then-36-year-old, Kansas-based Montgomery met Stinnett in an online chatroom called ""Ratter Chatter."" Stinnett was talking to prospective buyers for a terrier and happened to mention she was eight months pregnant.

Montgomery, under the customer name Darlene Fischer, claimed she too was expecting – generating an email exchange that led Montgomery to schedule a visit to Stinnett's home over state lines to view a pup.

Unknown to Stinnett, Montgomery had undergone sterilization after the birth of her fourth child.

On Dec. 16, 2004, Montgomery entered Stinnett's home, strangled the 23-year-old woman and proceeded to carve out the premature baby from her womb with a kitchen knife. At one point, Stinnett is said to have woken from her unconscious state and attempted to fight back, only to be strangled to death.

Sightings and anecdotes of Montgomery parading the baby girl in a Winnie the Pooh outfit about town quickly emerged. Montgomery told others from church that she delivered her baby at a women's center in a nearby Kansas town and that she had given her the biblical name of Abigail.

Stinnett's lifeless body was discovered by her mother, Becky Harper, about an hour after the assault – and a frantic search for the tiny baby commenced. The following day, after forensic computer scientists traced the online communication between the women, Montgomery was arrested at her home in the 385-person town of Melvern, Kansas, where the newborn was also recovered.

The baby girl survived and was placed in the care of her father. She would now be 16 but has lived a quiet life away from the public eye. Her mother was laid to rest in Skidmore.

However, Montgomery's supporters and legal team contend that she suffers from severe mental illness induced from a lifetime of extreme physical and sexual abuse, forced into prostitution as a young teen and evident damage to the brain, as shown in scans viewed by Fox News.

""Lisa Montgomery, who was born with brain damage, suffered a lifetime of sexual torture, and struggles with severe mental illness and keeping in touch with reality, has submitted a petition for executive clemency to President Trump,"" a statement from Montgomery's defense team asserts. ""Mrs. Montgomery is the only woman to face execution in America for the type of crime she committed – attacking a pregnant woman and taking the baby – because most prosecutors recognize that such crimes are the product of severe mental illness and trauma.""

The nation's three leading mental health organizations – the National Alliance of Mental Illness, Mental Health America, and Treatment Advocacy Center – have also written to urge Trump to commute Mrs. Montgomery's sentence.

""We believe that Ms. Montgomery, who acted in grip of a psychotic episode, should not be subject to the death penalty due to her brain damage and severe mental illnesses, and a sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of release is an appropriate sentence for her,"" the letter said.

"Stocks trade off highs, but Dow still up 400 points amid escalating protests at Capitol","The Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 rose to all-time highs on Wednesday, with traders cheering the prospects of additional fiscal stimulus as results from the runoff elections in Georgia rolled in.

The 30-Dow climbed 466 points, or 1.5%. The Dow briefly rose more than 600 points earlier in the session. The S&P 500 advanced 0.9%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite traded lower by 0.2%. Earlier in the day, it was down more than 1%.

Stocks traded off their highs, and the CBOE Volatility Index moved higher as protestors stormed the Capitol just after lawmakers began meeting to count the Electoral College votes and declare Joe Biden as the election winner. Still, the Dow remained solidly higher and Treasurys, normally a safety trade, were lower.

The 10-year Treasury note yield topped 1% for the first time since March. As of 3:14 p.m. ET, the benchmark rate traded at 1.037%.

Democrat Raphael Warnock is projected to win the Georgia U.S. Senate special election runoff against incumbent Republican Kelly Loeffler, according to NBC News. In the other Senate runoff election, Democrat Jon Ossoff was leading Republican Sen. David Perdue, but NBC said the race was too close to call.

If both Democrats win, that would make a 50-50 tie in the upper chamber, with Vice President-elect Kamala Harris as the tiebreaker vote to give the party control of the Senate. This outcome could facilitate the passing of new coronavirus relief, raising hope for the country's economic recovery.

""I think there's an expectation ... that there's going to be a lot more spending,"" Jason Trennert, chairman of Strategas, said on CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" on Wednesday. ""If the Democrats were to pick up two seats, there's no question in my mind that later this year there would be a sense that more spending is needed.""

Goldman Sachs expects another big stimulus package to the tune of $600 billion in the near term if Democrats prevail and take the Senate. Certain stocks gained on expectations for additional government aid.

The small-cap benchmark Russell 2000 jumped 3.7%. Industrial giant Caterpillar surged 5.5%.

JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America shares were up 4.9% and 6.6%, respectively, amid the 10-year yield topping the 1% milestone as higher rates should help their bottom lines.

Tom Lee, head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors, also pointed out the result brings clarity to the market outlook, which is a positive.

""I don't know the future, but to me, the 'uncertainty' of the election is arguably a bigger overhang than the actual outcome,"" Lee said in a note to clients.

Names that could be specifically helped by a Democrat agenda gained. The Invesco Solar ETF (TAN) rose 8.4%.

Tech stocks — the best-performing market group over the past year — lagged on Wednesday amid concerns over higher tax rates. The prospects of new stimulus also made tech stocks less attractive relative to beaten-down cyclical names. Facebook and Amazon both fell at least 2%, and Netflix dipped 2.5%.

""In the immediate term, markets are pricing in more stimulus. From an equity standpoint, that means tech underperformance and cyclical/value outperformance,"" Tom Essaye, founder of Sevens Report, said in a note. ""The biggest takeaway from the Democrats win is more power behind the cyclical/value/higher rates trade.""

On the data front, private payrolls fell 123,000 in December, marking the first contraction since the early days of the pandemic, according to a report from ADP. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been expecting growth of 60,000.

Meanwhile, Vice President Mike Pence said he would reject President Donald Trump's calls to block Joe Biden's election confirmation.

""It is my considered judgement that my oath to support and defend the Constitution constrains me from claiming unilateral authority to determine which electoral votes should be counted and which should not,"" Pence said in a three-page letter addressed to ""Dear Colleague.""

Pence was later ushered out of the Senate as the Capitol went into lockdown, with rioters storming the complex. A Senate member later told NBC News that Pence and Sen. Charles Grassley had been taken to a secure location. The situation started after Trump encouraged thousands of supporters to march to the Capitol to protest the confirmation of Biden's victory.

"Trump privately admits it’s over, but wants to brawl for attention","Trump’s team hopes to secure 180 House members, along with 13 senators, to object to Biden’s Electoral College win, likely turning a traditionally short ceremony into a day-long event.

If lawmakers contest results from the six swing states of Pennsylvania, Nevada, Wisconsin, Georgia, Michigan and Arizona, the vote could drag into Thursday.

Rep. Scott Perry of Pennsylvania, who visited the Trump campaign headquarters shortly after the election, is expected to play a role in contesting his state’s results, according to a former Trump campaign staffer. And newly sworn in Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia recently spoke to Trump, making it likely she will play a role in contesting her state’s results.

Still, Democrats are expected to join with numerous Republicans to eventually declare Biden the winner.

Jason Miller, who served as a Trump campaign senior adviser, argued Trump’s election fight is not about his own race but about fixing the election system for future elections.

“We want to make sure people have confidence in our election system,"" he said. ""We don’t want this all to get swept under the rug.""

The White House did not respond to a request for comment.

For the two months, Trump has falsely insisted he won the election, even as states across the nation certified wins for Biden and selected electors who voted last month to make Biden the 46th president.

But privately, Trump has told some allies he knows he won’t prevail. And even publicly, Trump has made statements about Biden that show he expects the Democrat will be in the White House.

At a campaign rally in Georgia Monday night, Trump speculated about what a relationship between President Biden and North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un might look like. “I got along very well with Kim Jong Un. I don’t think that Joe’s going to, based on what I’ve heard, but I got along very well with him,” Trump said without calling Biden the next president.

Those around Trump compared the president’s attitude to someone who knows he lost a game, but believe it’s only because the referee made a bad call. “He’s come to terms with the election results,” said one of the three people. “He accepts them, but he doesn't believe them.”

Trump has repeatedly asserted the election was fraudulently stolen from him, using unsubstantiated allegations of voter fraud to file lawsuits trying to overturn the results. He filed a new challenge last week and still has a half dozen appeals and motions pending at the Supreme Court. None of them are expected to go anywhere.

Trump has long played the victim card, arguing he’s just like Americans who feel betrayed by the political system. As evidence, he and his allies have latched onto Robert Mueller’s probe into whether the Trump campaign coordinated with Russia on its 2016 election interference campaign. While Mueller uncovered extensive Trump campaign efforts to conspire with Russian contacts, he concluded there was no criminal conspiracy.

“After experiencing all of the baseless allegations around Russia and being proven right, you now have similar people coming to you and telling you that this system screwed you again and his view is, ‘I’m not going to get screwed a second time,’” said former White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer.",[],https://news.google.com,high

"Severe allergic reactions after COVID-19 vaccination are ‘exceedingly rare,’ CDC says","Life-threatening allergic reactions after COVID-19 vaccination, called anaphylaxis, do occur, but are ""exceedingly rare,"" officials with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said on a call Wednesday.

The CDC has documented 21 confirmed cases of severe allergic reactions after COVID-19 vaccinations, which averages out to a rate of 11.1 severe reactions per 1 million doses administered, according to Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases.

Of 20 patients with available data, all had recovered, the CDC noted.

The figures were published in a new CDC report released Wednesday and are based on an initial 1.9 million doses administered in the U.S. While the agency has since documented 29 total cases, it plans to detail those cases in an upcoming report.

Most people who developed symptoms did so within 15 minutes of vaccination and 17 patients had a documented history of allergies or allergic reactions, including to medical products, foods, and insect stings.

ALASKA HEALTH CARE WORKER SUFFERS ADVERSE REACTION AFTER COVID-19 VACCINE

For comparison, the rate of anaphylaxis for the flu vaccine is 1.3 cases per 1 million doses administered. While Messonnier noted that the rate of severe allergic reactions is 10 times greater for COVID-19 vaccinations, she assured that the cases are still ""exceedingly rare.""

Most importantly, the CDC says anyone who has an immediate or allergic reaction to the first dose of Pfizer or Moderna’s vaccine should not receive the second dose. Also, those with a known allergy to components in the vaccine, or closely related components in the vaccine, are not advised to receive the vaccine at this time.

DOCTOR ALLERGIC TO CORONAVIRUS VACCINE DETAILS IMMEDIATE REACTION

Additionally, the CDC advises anyone with a history of an immediate allergic reaction to a vaccine, or a history of anaphylaxis due to any cause, be observed for 30 minutes after vaccination. Most individuals are observed for 15 minutes after vaccination.

Since the Pfizer and BioNTech jab saw emergency authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration before the one created by Moderna did, most of the CDC's documented cases of severe allergic reactions cropped up among recipients of Pfizer’s vaccine, said Messonnier.

That said, the federal health agency’s recommendations apply to both drug sponsors' vaccines.

""At this point, we really don’t have enough data to say that there’s any difference in the risk [between Pfizer and Moderna vaccines], and that’s why our recommendations apply to both vaccines,"" she said.

LIVE UPDATES: Today's latest COVID-19 headlines

CDC officials repeatedly emphasized that the known and potential benefits of COVID-19 vaccination outweigh the risk of serious consequences arising from COVID-19 disease.

""That doesn't mean, however, that we couldn't see potential serious health events in the future,"" Messonnier said.

""There are tremendous efforts underway right now to try to understand what might be the cause of this severe allergic reaction with both vaccines. I don't think we have anything definitive to say, there’s a lot of hypothesis about it but at this point, our recommendations for this apply to both vaccines,"" she added.

GET THE FOX NEWS APP

The information about anaphylaxis cases has not had ""significant effects"" on distribution plans, and, as the CDC has previously said, all vaccination sites must be properly equipped and trained should any person experience anaphylaxis following vaccination.

Echoing remarks from other top federal officials, Messonnier voiced high hopes for expedited vaccination pace in the coming weeks amid resounding criticism of a slow nationwide vaccination effort.","['Kayla Rivas', 'Kayla Rivas Is A Health Reporter', 'Joined Fox News In April']",https://news.google.com,high
"U.S. could see up to 150,000 more COVID-19 deaths by February as new strain takes hold, expert warns","The U.S. set a fresh record for hospitalizations with the coronavirus-borne illness COVID-19 on Wednesday, as experts said the new, far more infectious variant makes it even more crucial to get the nation’s so-far underwhelming vaccine program on track.

The U.S. added at least 238,999 new cases on Tuesday and at least 3,664 people died, according to a New York Times tracker. The U.S. has averaged 219,684 new cases every day in the past week, confirming the worst case scenario forecasts of experts who said the holiday season would lead to fresh surges.

There was a record of 131,195 COVID-19 patients in U.S. hospitals on Tuesday, according to the COVID Tracking Project, breaking the record of 128,210 set a day earlier. The U.S. continues to lead the world by cases, at 21 million, according to data aggregated by Johns Hopkins University, and by deaths, at 359,077, or about a fifth of the global total.

The new variant of the virus, that first emerged in the U.K. where it has run rampant, has been found across the U.S. and is likely spreading in communities.

“ ‘We should expect, without further action, that as the new strain takes hold, we will see an additional 10 million infections in the U.S. between now and end of February and during that time, we could easily see an additional 100,000 to 150,000 deaths.’ ” — Dr. Ashish K. Jha, dean and professor of health services, policy and practice, Brown University School of Public Health

“It is, at this point, almost surely too widespread to be contained in any specific state or region of our country,” said Dr. Ashish K. Jha, dean and professor of health services, policy and practice at the Brown University School of Public Health, in a statement. “This new variant is significantly more infectious, threatening a rapid increase in rates of new cases and a much, much more deadly and destructive pandemic. This demands an urgent rethinking of our current policy responses.”

The variant has been named B.1.1.7 and is estimated to be 40% to 70% more infectious than the original virus, said Jha, although it does not so far seem to make people sicker. Officials expect it to respond to the vaccines that have so far been granted emergency use authorization for use in the pandemic. A strain that Jha called a “close cousin” of the new variant has been found in South Africa and the U.K. but has not yet been detected in the U.S.

A significant increase in rates of infection will translate into a much, much more deadly pandemic, he said.

“One epidemiologist, (Adam Kucharski, associate professor at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine), comparing a 50% increase in severity of disease with a 50% increase in infectiousness, in a hypothetical in a town with 10,000 infections increased infectiousness would lead to a five-fold increase in deaths over a month – because a lower death rate of a very large number of cases produces many more deaths than a higher death rate but a lower number of cases,” said Jha.

The new variant is estimated to account for about 1% of all infections now, but will likely account for the vast majority by March.

“We should expect, without further action, that as the new strain takes hold, we will see an additional 10 million infections in the U.S. between now and end of February and during that time, we could easily see an additional 100,000 to 150,000 deaths,” he said.

That means it is more important than ever for Americans to comply with public safety measures experts have recommended throughout the pandemic, namely frequent hand washing, social distancing and wearing a face mask in all public spaces. People should avoid gatherings that bring more than one household together, and testing must be improved, he said.

“And finally, we must redouble our efforts to vaccinate as many people as we possibly can,” said Jha.

Read now:There is only a slim chance that the vaccine will stop the COVID pandemic this year

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s vaccine tracker shows that just 4.8 million people had been dosed as of 9.00 a.m. ET on Jan. 5, and just 17 million doses had been distributed. That’s far below the most recently revised number of 20 million deliveries promised by the administration of President Donald Trump, and way off the original promise of 100 million.

Trump has left it to states to administer the vaccine program — tweeting that it was “up to the states to administer” and then calling some states “very slow” — meaning that stressed state health departments, which have already had to deal with testing, contact tracing, public information campaigns and deciding when or whether schools or businesses should be open or closed, are now tasked with handling the biggest public health effort in decades.

It’s a new year, and a good time to choose new stock to line the portfolio. Investment banking giant Goldman Sachs has been watching the markets with an eye toward the long term – and a finger on pulse of the present. The firm is bullish following the passage of the COVID relief bill last month, seeing the direct income assistance of $600 per person – or $1200 for married couples – as a positive for consumers’ disposable income in the here-and-now.And with consumer spending making up some two-thirds of the US economy, and boost to that metric is seen as good for the whole. Taking the COVID relief checks into account, Goldman Sachs' chief economist, Jan Hatzius, raised his expectations for US economic growth in 1Q21 – bumping his GDP forecast from 3% to 5%.“While the income effects of the fiscal package will be very front-loaded, we expect the impact on consumer spending to be more evenly distributed throughout the year,” Hatzius noted. The economist sees current conditions – with lockdowns in place, as putting something of a damper on immediate spending, but leading to pent-up demand later in the year. With that in mind, Hatzius is predicting sequential gains in Q2 and Q3, and full-year GDP growth of 5.8%, up 9% from his previous estimate.The stock analysts at Goldman are keen to follow Hatzius’ lead, and they’ve been combing the market for stocks that are likely to gain as the markets take a long-term rising trajectory. The firm's analysts are pulling the trigger on two stocks in particular, noting that each has the potential to deliver double-digit gains in the year ahead. We ran the two through TipRanks’ database to see what other Wall Street's analysts have to say about them.17 Education & Technology (YQ)The worldwide pandemic had one effect that could never have been predicted in advance: the sudden shift of schools to mass online classes. Remote office work has been around for a long time, and at the secondary and college levels, schools have had long experience with correspondence courses – but mass online learning, even down to the primary level, had never been attempted. Companies like 17 Education, however, take up the challenge of online learning.17 Education is a Chinese company, dedicated to joining technology with high-quality educational content to create more effective and efficient tutoring services for K-12. The program includes both online and in-classroom solutions – 17 Education bills itself as a full-service educational technology provider.It is also a new company to the financial markets. YQ stock went public just this past December, when trading commenced on the 4th of the month. The IPO opened flat, with shares priced at $10.50, the midpoint of the pre-IPO range. By December 9, the share price had nearly doubled. Since then, however, the stock is down 34% from its peak.Among the bulls is Goldman analyst Christine Cho, who initiated her coverage of YQ with a Buy rating and a $21 price target. This figure indicates a 55% upside for the next 12 months. (To watch Cho’s track record, click here)Cho is bullish on the company’s application of big data systems to analyze and streamline classroom solutions, and sees its unique ‘hybrid’ model of combining in-school and online courses as a net plus. “We see [YQ] translating into two potential advantages for its AST [after school tutoring] business: (1) proprietary school-level insights enabling YQ to develop more localized/customized content, and (2) ability to grow paid enrollments rapidly at a low student acquisition cost — a key challenge in the online AST industry — through penetration of organic in-school MAUs…” The Goldman review is one of two on record for 17 Education; the other is also a Buy, making the consensus view a Moderate Buy. The stock is priced at $13.5, and the $20.50 average price target gives an upside potential of ~52%.

ChampionX is an oilfield technology company that conducted a major change in 1H20. It’s namesake, ChampionX Holdings, merged with Apergy Corp, with the combined company attaching the ChampionX name to the new partner’s trading history. CHX started trading in June 2020, and in December, the company moved its ticker from the NYSE to the NASDAQ.CHX offers a range of oilfield tech solutions, including such specialized applications as drilling fluid and mud additives, fracturing fluid systems, and well cementing, in addition to drilling technologies.

"Private payrolls unexpectedly drop by 123,000 in December: ADP","TipRanks

It’s a new year, and a good time to choose new stock to line the portfolio. Investment banking giant Goldman Sachs has been watching the markets with an eye toward the long term – and a finger on pulse of the present. The firm is bullish following the passage of the COVID relief bill last month, seeing the direct income assistance of $600 per person – or $1200 for married couples – as a positive for consumers’ disposable income in the here-and-now.And with consumer spending making up some two-thirds of the US economy, and boost to that metric is seen as good for the whole. Taking the COVID relief checks into account, Goldman Sachs' chief economist, Jan Hatzius, raised his expectations for US economic growth in 1Q21 – bumping his GDP forecast from 3% to 5%.“While the income effects of the fiscal package will be very front-loaded, we expect the impact on consumer spending to be more evenly distributed throughout the year,” Hatzius noted. The economist sees current conditions – with lockdowns in place, as putting something of a damper on immediate spending, but leading to pent-up demand later in the year. With that in mind, Hatzius is predicting sequential gains in Q2 and Q3, and full-year GDP growth of 5.8%, up 9% from his previous estimate.The stock analysts at Goldman are keen to follow Hatzius’ lead, and they’ve been combing the market for stocks that are likely to gain as the markets take a long-term rising trajectory. The firm's analysts are pulling the trigger on two stocks in particular, noting that each has the potential to deliver double-digit gains in the year ahead. We ran the two through TipRanks’ database to see what other Wall Street's analysts have to say about them.17 Education & Technology (YQ)The worldwide pandemic had one effect that could never have been predicted in advance: the sudden shift of schools to mass online classes. Remote office work has been around for a long time, and at the secondary and college levels, schools have had long experience with correspondence courses – but mass online learning, even down to the primary level, had never been attempted. Companies like 17 Education, however, take up the challenge of online learning.17 Education is a Chinese company, dedicated to joining technology with high-quality educational content to create more effective and efficient tutoring services for K-12. The program includes both online and in-classroom solutions – 17 Education bills itself as a full-service educational technology provider.It is also a new company to the financial markets. YQ stock went public just this past December, when trading commenced on the 4th of the month. The IPO opened flat, with shares priced at $10.50, the midpoint of the pre-IPO range. By December 9, the share price had nearly doubled. Since then, however, the stock is down 34% from its peak.Among the bulls is Goldman analyst Christine Cho, who initiated her coverage of YQ with a Buy rating and a $21 price target. This figure indicates a 55% upside for the next 12 months. (To watch Cho’s track record, click here)Cho is bullish on the company’s application of big data systems to analyze and streamline classroom solutions, and sees its unique ‘hybrid’ model of combining in-school and online courses as a net plus. “We see [YQ] translating into two potential advantages for its AST [after school tutoring] business: (1) proprietary school-level insights enabling YQ to develop more localized/customized content, and (2) ability to grow paid enrollments rapidly at a low student acquisition cost — a key challenge in the online AST industry — through penetration of organic in-school MAUs…” The Goldman review is one of two on record for 17 Education; the other is also a Buy, making the consensus view a Moderate Buy. The stock is priced at $13.5, and the $20.50 average price target gives an upside potential of ~52%. (See YQ stock analysis on TipRanks)ChampionX Corporation (CHX)17 Education wasn’t the only new ticker to hit the markets at the height of the pandemic, rather, it was one of many. ChampionX is an oilfield technology company that conducted a major change in 1H20. It’s namesake, ChampionX Holdings, merged with Apergy Corp, with the combined company attaching the ChampionX name to the new partner’s trading history. CHX started trading in June 2020, and in December, the company moved its ticker from the NYSE to the NASDAQ.CHX offers a range of oilfield tech solutions, including such specialized applications as drilling fluid and mud additives, fracturing fluid systems, and well cementing, in addition to drilling technologies. These tech services are essential for the oil producers – that own the wells – to get the product to the surface.

Wyndham Destinations Acquires Travel + Leisure,"Travel + Leisure will be acquired by a timeshare company for $100 million. What exactly will this look like?

Timeshare company acquires Travel + Leisure

Wyndham Destinations has just acquired popular travel publication Travel + Leisure from Meredith Corporation. Wyndham Destinations is a timeshare company that’s run separately from Wyndham Hotels & Resorts.

With this $100 million acquisition, Meredith Company will get $35 million at closing, with trailing payments to be completed by June 2024. The acquisition is expected to be neutral to earning for the new Travel + Leisure Co. in year one, and accretive in year two. This acquisition follows Meredith Company having reported a $289 million loss earlier this year, given how hard advertising was hit by the pandemic.

Meredith Company will continue to operate and monetize Travel + Leisure under a 30-year royalty-free renewable licensing relationship. The deal also includes a five-year marketing commitment across Meredith’s portfolio of brands.

As it’s described, this deal combines “the travel company’s portfolio of resorts, membership, and lifestyle travel brands with the world’s most trusted travel lifestyle content curator.”

Wyndham Destinations says this accelerates its strategic plan to “build on its leading position as the world’s largest vacation club and exchange company and expand into new leisure travel and licensing markets.”

Michael Brown, CEO of Wyndham Destinations, describes this acquisition as follows:

“We acquired Travel + Leisure, including access to its global audience of 35 million loyal followers across multiple platforms and nearly 60,000 club members, because it matches our passion and purpose to put the world on vacation. Over the past 18 months, we have laid the foundation to expand our footprint beyond our core vacation ownership business, and today we add one of the most trusted and influential brands in travel through the acquisition of Travel + Leisure. This iconic brand, along with its authoritative content and wide audience, will help accelerate and amplify the growth of new capital-light travel businesses and services, as we take the next step in expanding our reach within the global leisure travel industry.”

Wyndham Destinations will rebrand as Travel + Leisure Co.

It’s not just that Wyndham Destinations is acquiring Travel + Leisure, but the timeshare company will rebrand as Travel + Leisure Co., and starting in mid-February 2021 Travel + Leisure Co. stock will begin trading on the NYSE under the ticker symbol TNL.

With this change, we should expect new branded products from Wyndham Destinations, with the goal of growing the timeshare business, launching new branded travel services, and expanding licensing agreements under the Travel + Leisure Group.

Help me understand this acquisition

The concept of companies purchasing media businesses in their “space” is nothing new. Everyone has the right to monetize their business how they’d like, so good for Travel + Leisure and Wyndham Destinations, I suppose.

That being said, I can’t help but find this whole thing a bit ironic. These companies are literally on the opposite ends of the travel spectrum — Travel + Leisure is primarily focused on luxury hotels and exotic destinations, and posts “travel inspiration” like this:

Meanwhile Wyndham Destinations has timeshare properties in Orlando that look like this:

Photo credit: Wyndham Destinations

Now, in fairness, I suppose Wyndham Destinations probably got a deal on Travel + Leisure, given the environment. Furthermore, I imagine the timeshare business hasn’t been hit as hard as other businesses in the travel space, since customers are locked in for a lifetime.

Still, is this really a good fit in terms of cross-marketing opportunities? “Well, I was going to stay at the Four Seasons Bora Bora for a week, but instead let me buy a timeshare in Orlando for a lifetime?”

Personally I have very strong feelings about the timeshare business, but I recognize others feel differently, so I won’t even get into that. But I just don’t get if Wyndham Destinations is somehow trying to go upmarket here, or if Wyndham Destinations wants Travel + Leisure’s audience to go downmarket.

The best comparison I can come up with is that this would be like Applebee’s acquiring Capital Grille and then rebranding all restaurants as Capital Grille.

Bottom line

Travel + Leisure is being bought by a large timeshare company. The timeshare company will rebrand as Travel + Leisure, and I guess it’s hoping that buying the media company will expand its potential consumer base.

I still can’t really make sense of this, though, since the two companies don’t really seem to complement one another much.

"Markets will get plenty of notice before Fed cuts back on bond purchases, minutes show","The Federal Reserve will do what it can to prevent a taper tantrum when it finally decides to scale back on its bond purchases, minutes from the central bank's most recent meeting showed Wednesday.

Following a two-day session Dec. 15-16, thepolicymaking Federal Open Market Committee voted to keep its benchmark short-term interest rate anchored near zero.

Markets, though, were focused on discussion surrounding the Fed's asset purchase program. The central bank has been buying at least $120 billion in Treasurys and mortgage-backed securities each month, and at the meeting pledged to keep doing so until it sees ""substantial further progress"" towards its goals regarding inflation and employment.

Minutes noted unanimous approval around the ""outcome-based"" approach to the program, though members noted that doesn't mean the purchases will be tied to specific numeric goals.

Officials agreed that markets would get plenty of notice before the asset purchases were curtailed. The last time the Fed cut back on its asset purchases, it triggered a ""taper tantrum"" in the market that officials want to avoid this time.

""Various participants noted the importance of the Committee clearly communicating its assessment of actual and expected progress toward its longer-run goals well in advance of the time when it would be judged substantial enough to warrant a change in the pace of purchases,"" the minutes said.

Members further noted that once the ""substantial further progress"" threshold has been reached, the tapering of purchases would be ""gradual"" and along the lines of what the Fed did starting in 2013. During the previous reduction of purchases, the Fed cut how much it was buying each month. Later, it allowed a capped amount of proceeds from the bonds it was still holding roll off each month while reinvesting the rest.

There had been some anticipation that the committee either might accelerate the pace of purchases or extend the duration of the bonds. The latter move would be an effort to stimulate the economy through lowering longer-term interest rates.

Though markets were watching for how much favor committee members had to adjust the duration of purchases, the minutes noted that only ""a couple"" officials indicated they were ""open to"" the idea of buying longer-dated bonds.

Also at the meeting, members adjusted their economic estimates for the next several years. On balance, the committee grew less pessimistic about economic growth than it was in September and lowered its projections for the unemployment rate.

Officials noted that the economic data around the time of the meeting was mostly better than expected, but the accelerate Covid-19 spread was posing a challenge and growth overall remained considerably below its pre-pandemic level.

""They noted that the economic recovery thus far had been stronger than anticipated — suggesting greater momentum in economic activity than had been previously thought — but viewed the more recent indicators as signaling that the pace of recovery had slowed,"" the minutes stated. ""With the pandemic worsening across the country, the expansion was expected to slow even further in coming months.""

There was virtually no change in the post-meeting statement from the previous meeting except for the language around asset purchases.",['Jeff Cox'],https://news.google.com,high
Impossible Foods cuts wholesale prices by 15% for second time in one year,"Impossible Foods cuts wholesale prices by 15% for second time in one year Business News Reuters Staff

(Reuters) - Impossible Foods Inc, maker of the plant-based Impossible Burger, said on Wednesday it would cut prices for foodservice distributors in the United States by about 15% amid increasing demand for its burgers.

FILE PHOTO: A banh mi sandwich made with a plant-based Impossible Pork patty at the Impossible Foods headquarters in Silicon Valley, in San Francisco, California, U.S., December 19, 2019. REUTERS/Richa Naidu

The price cut is its second in a year and the California-based company is asking distributors to pass on the savings to restaurants and consumers.

The Beyond Meat rival has tied up with several restaurants including Burger King, Starbucks and White Castle, and expanded its retail footprint to thousands of stores across the United States last year.

With the latest cut, the lowest possible price to distributors for the Impossible Burger would be $6.80 per pound, but it is still significantly higher than ground beef prices which range from about $2 to $3 per pound for low fat and non-organic varieties, according to the United States Department of Agriculture.

Impossible Foods Chief Executive Officer Patrick Brown in a statement noted the price cut is “not the last”.

The company, known for its vegan patties that taste and cook like real meat, said it is also lowering prices for distributors in Canada, Singapore, Hong Kong and Macau, with varying cuts based on the region.

Demand for plant-based meat has risen during the pandemic after beef and pork producers shut many meat plants to curb the rapid spread of the coronavirus outbreak. Impossible Foods said production has increased six-fold since 2019.",[],https://news.google.com,high
Tesla Sells Out Of Q1 Supply Of Model Y In China Just Days After Opening Order Page: Report,"At the start of 2021, Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) opened up the order page for the Model Y in China. Tesla has been working to expand Gigafactory Shanghai to mass-produce the Model Y for sale in China and export to neighboring areas including Australia and parts of Europe.

Now a report from Electrek shows Tesla has already received enough orders to exhaust its supply of the popular vehicle for the first three months of 2021.

The order page has only been live for about six days, but the delivery estimate on Tesla's site is showing that orders will not be filled until the second quarter of 2021. The performance version is being quoted as available in the third quarter of the year.

A study covered Tuesday said Tesla may already be producing 3,000 Model Ys per week at Gigafactory Shanghai. If accurate, that would mean Tesla received over 36,000 Model Y orders in six days, or 6,000 orders per day, double the amount of Model Y the company is currently able to produce.

Why Tesla Stock Jumped on Wednesday,"What happened

Shares of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) surged higher on Wednesday, extending the stock's early momentum in 2021. Shares rose as much as 5.3% but were up 4.8% as of 12:35 p.m. EST.

The stock's gain is likely due to a combination of broader market strength in renewable energy stocks and an upgraded analyst price target for Tesla shares.

So what

Renewable energy stocks like Tesla are trading higher on Wednesday, likely due to speculation that Democrats have a chance at winning the Senate majority. With the party typically more willing to help subsidize growth in green energy than Republicans, investors may be speculating that a Democrat majority could lead to legislation that benefits Tesla.

In addition, shares are likely trading higher because of Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas' move on Tuesday afternoon to upgrade his 12-month price target for Tesla stock from $540 to $810. The analyst says his bullish view is backed by the company's recent capital raise, strong growth in fourth-quarter deliveries, and a rosier outlook for Tesla's long-term growth potential in vehicle deliveries.

Shares of the growth stock are ""richly valued for a reason,"" the analyst told investors.

Now what

Tesla now has a market capitalization greater than $700 billion, capturing how heavily the market is betting on the automaker. While the company's valuation doesn't make sense when compared to trailing financials, investors are betting that Tesla's sales can continue growing at high growth rates for years to come. In addition, some investors may be expecting Tesla to eventually generate substantial revenue and profits from the self-driving technology it is working on.","['Daniel Sparks', 'Tmfdanielsparks', 'Daniel Sparks Is A Senior Technology Specialist At The Motley Fool.

US STOCKS-Wall Street drifts higher as Georgia runoffs get underway,"(For a Reuters live blog on U.S., UK and European stock markets, click LIVE/ or type LIVE/ in a news window)

* Micron jumps after Citi’s double upgrade

* Wall Street’s fear gauge slips after Monday’s surge

* Indexes up: Dow 0.19%, S&P 0.32%, Nasdaq 0.50% (Adds comment, details; updates prices)

Jan 5 (Reuters) - Wall Street’s main indexes climbed on Tuesday as investors took advantage of previous session’s slump, while waiting for the outcome of battleground Georgia’s Senate runoff elections, which will determine the balance of power in Washington.

The latest polls from data website 538 here gave a slight edge to the two Democratic challengers who need to win both races for Democrats to gain U.S. Senate control from Republicans.

Along with their narrow majority in the House of Representatives, a “blue sweep” of Congress could usher in larger fiscal stimulus. It could also pave the way for President-elect Joe Biden to push through greater corporate regulation and higher taxes.

“There’s a portion of the investment community that worries if Georgia votes in the Democrats, that taxes are going to rise and policy extremes are going to happen. But that’s a minority of the investment population,” said Robert Pavlik, senior portfolio manager at Dakota Wealth in Fairfield, Connecticut.

“The majority of the investment community still believes it’s not the end of the world.”

The Cboe Volatility Index flip-flopped after closing at its highest level in two months in the prior session, which saw Wall Street’s main indexes drop to two-week lows as investors booked profits at the start of the year.

At 11:40 a.m. ET the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 56.91 points, or 0.19%, to 30,280.18, the S&P 500 gained 11.78 points, or 0.32%, to 3,712.46 and the Nasdaq Composite gained 63.28 points, or 0.50%, to 12,761.73.

Energy stocks jumped about 2% on the back of higher oil prices.

Consumer staples, utilities and healthcare were the laggards.

Although the start of vaccine rollouts and massive monetary support powered the major U.S. stock indexes to record levels recently, the discovery of a more contagious strain of the coronavirus and the latest virus-related curbs have muddied the economic outlook.

Britain began its third national lockdown. Meanwhile, New York on Monday found its first case of the highly contagious variant of the coronavirus.

“The market could end up being choppy for much of the first quarter as investors try to digest soft economic data because of the most current lockdowns,” said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research

ISM survey showed U.S. manufacturing activity rose to its highest level in nearly 2-1/2 years in December, likely as spiraling new COVID-19 infections pulled demand away from services towards goods.

Chipmaker Micron Technology Inc rose about 5% after Citigroup raised its rating on the stock to “buy” on expectations of a recovery in demand and pricing for DRAM chips.

U.S.-listed shares of China Telecom Corp Ltd and China Mobile Ltd added about 10% each, while those of China Unicom Hong Kong Ltd advanced 14% after the NYSE reversed its decision to delist the stocks.

Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 2.2-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and by a 2.1-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.

Are stock valuations in bubble territory? Analysts are not convinced,"Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. NYSE

With stock market valuations at historically high levels despite the ever-present shadow of the coronavirus pandemic, speculation about a market bubble has been rekindled. The rollout of Covid-19 vaccines and associated hopes for imminent economic recovery, along with unprecedented fiscal and monetary support from governments and central banks around the world, has driven equity markets beyond or close to record highs in recent weeks. Going into Wednesday's trading session, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 67% from its March lows, while the S&P 500 was up 70% and the Nasdaq 92%. Although the distribution of vaccines is underway in many major economies, caseloads are rising amid mutated strains of the virus, forcing a number of countries to reintroduce stringent lockdown measures. Jeremy Grantham, long-term investment strategist and co-founder of GMO, said in a note Tuesday that the protracted market bull run which began in 2009 had ""matured into a fully-fledged epic bubble."" ""Featuring extreme overvaluation, explosive price increases, frenzied issuance, and hysterically speculative investor behavior, I believe this event will be recorded as one of the great bubbles of financial history, right along with the South Sea bubble, 1929, and 2000,"" Grantham said.

Three reasons 'bubble' worries are overdone

Grantham highlighted that the stock market price-to-earnings ratio is in the top few percentiles historically while economic growth is among the bottom percentiles. ""This is completely without precedent and may even be a better measure of speculative intensity than any SPAC (special purpose acquisition company),"" he said. Earlier this week, Wall Street titan Carl Icahn also cautioned that the kind of ""wild rallies"" seen in markets of late inevitably ""hit a wall and go into a major painful correction."" ""Nobody can predict when it will happen, but when that does happen, look out below,"" Icahn added. However, many analysts are not convinced that the new lockdown measures represent a fundamental deterioration in the economic outlook, indicating some solace for equities. Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management, said Wednesday that the medium-term outlook for economic and earnings growth remains positive. UBS expects the global economy to expand by 6.3% in 2021 after a contraction of around 3.5% in 2020. ""After strong earnings surprises over the past two quarters, including third-quarter earnings in the U.S. being 40% higher than in the prior quarter, the outlook for corporate earnings in 2021 is also encouraging,"" he added.

Haefele offered two further reasons why concerns about a bubble are ""overdone,"" the first being that valuations are not necessarily indicative of euphoria given the macroeconomic context. ""At 6%, the equity risk premium for global equities is above the average since 1998 of around 4%, indicating that stocks remain attractive relative to bonds,"" he said. Equity risk premium is the additional return an investor earns by investing in stocks rather over a risk-free rate. U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell also made note of this in December. ""If you look at P/Es, they're historically high, but in a world where the risk-free rate is going to be low for a sustained period, the equity premium, which is really the reward you get for taking equity risk, would be what you'd look at,"" Powell said on Dec. 18. ""And that's not at incredibly low levels, which would mean that they're not overpriced in that sense."" Finally, UBS analysts highlighted that based on data since 1960, average one-year returns on the S&P 500 have been 11.7% following an all-time high, versus 11.3% when markets are below high points. ""Data over the same period indicates that valuations are a poor short-term timing tool for investors, with little correlation between the S&P 500 P/E and subsequent one-year returns,"" Haefele's team said in the note.

Rising yields favor rotation

UBS recommended diversifying away from expensive portions of the market such as U.S. growth and large-cap stocks and toward small- and mid-caps, the U.K. market, and select consumer discretionary, financial and energy stocks. This rotation looked to be playing out around the world on Wednesday, with bond yields rising and cyclical value sectors rallying on the back of a growing likelihood that Democrats will control the U.S. Senate. Speaking to CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe"" on Wednesday, JPMorgan Asset Management global market strategist Mike Bell said rising yields would benefit financials over some of the big tech names that have benefited from falling interest rates.",['Elliot Smith'],https://news.google.com,high
Microsoft is asking if people want PS5 DualSense features in Xbox Series X/S controllers,"The company also wants to know if its new consoles are “next-gen” enough.

Software and games giant Microsoft is probing if its users want to have some of the features in Sony’s DualSense PS5 controller in its new Xbox Series X and Series S gamepads.

As reported by TechRadar, the company is asking people who recently bought its Xbox Series X or Series S consoles for their thoughts, including whether the hardware “feels next-gen.” Furthermore, Microsoft has asked users whether the PS5’s DualSense had any features that they might want to be included in the new Xbox controller.

Microsoft’s new gamepad already boasts a number of features that the PS4’s DualShock 4 had, including a dedicated button for sharing footage. The Xbox Series X controller was revealed in March 2020, with Microsoft saying that it was easier to hold.

The DualSense controller has received a lot of praise for the changes it has made, including new and improved haptic feedback and the introduction of adaptive triggers which change resistance depending on what is happening in the game.

"Before the Original Xbox, Microsoft Looked Into Buying EA, Square, Midway... and Nintendo","In an attempt to secure exclusives for the original Xbox, Microsoft uncuccessfully talked about acquiring EA, Square, Mortal Kombat publisher Midway, and even Nintendo – before it found the unexpected trump card of Bungie and Halo.

Loading

In a fascinating Bloomberg oral history about the creation of the original Xbox (that contains a lot more of Bill Gates shouting at people than you might expect), multiple Microsoft executives discuss the company's attempts at acquisitions.The first company approached was EA - which, due to its dominance in the industry at the time, team members apparently called the Snow White to the rest of the industry's Seven Dwarves. Then-head of business development Bob McBreen says the answer was ""No, thanks"", before Microsoft turned to Nintendo.""Steve made us go meet with Nintendo to see if they would consider being acquired,"" explains then director of third-party relationships, Kevin Bachus. ""They just laughed their asses off. Like, imagine an hour of somebody just laughing at you. That was kind of how that meeting went.""

Loading

It seems the teams met more than once, with McBreen adding, ""We actually had Nintendo in our building in January 2000 to work through the details of a joint venture where we gave them all the technical specs of the Xbox. The pitch was their hardware stunk, and compared to Sony PlayStation, it did. So the idea was, 'Listen, you’re much better at the game portions of it with Mario and all that stuff. Why don’t you let us take care of the hardware?' But it didn’t work out.""McBreen also discusses that a potential Square takeover went as far as Microsoft providing a letter of intent to buy the company. ""The next day,"" he continues, ""we’re sitting in their boardroom, and they said, 'Our banker would like to make a statement.' And basically, the banker said, 'Square cannot go through with this deal because the price is too low.' We packed up, we went home, and that was the end of Square.""Finally, Bachus explains that the ill-fated Midway Games - most famous for publishing the Mortal Kombat series - was ""very serious"" about being acquired by Microsoft, but it became a deal with low value to the company.Fatefully, furing this time Microsoft had also received a call from Bungie, enquiring about an acquisition – and from that call came Halo, almost inarguably Xbox's most iconic franchise, and helping cement what Xbox would become as a result.The acquisitions are just one part of a fascinating piece on Xbox's very early history - I highly recommend you give it a read if you've enjoyed the above.

Bose's new earbuds don't actually go in your ears,"There are plenty of truly wireless earbuds on the market, but not many of them can claim to be as unique as the new Bose Sport Open Earbuds. They're IPX4 rated, can go for 8 hours of battery life on a single charge — and make virtually no skin contact, sitting above the ear and allowing listeners to stay aware of their surroundings in a way that practically no other earbud can do.

According to Bose, the buds gently grip the ear's outer ridge in order to remain locked in place with no need for an in-ear tip. There's also no squeezing or vibration since these don't utilize the same audio-delivery methods as bone conduction earbuds. Instead, each bud uses ""a tiny dipole transducer placed and positioned for loud-and-clear personal audio that stays at the ear."" That should make them great for listening to music, podcasts, and more while staying alert during everyday actives and workouts. This idea of piping-in audio a short distance from your ear is also something we saw in the Bose Frames.

The buds open design remind me of an old-school Bluetooth earpiece.

The Bose Sport Open Earbuds have simple button controls that allow for quick access to common tasks like skipping songs or summoning your voice assistant. With an IPX4 water resistance rating, these should be primed to handle sweaty workouts and rainy jogging sessions. And thanks to an etched antenna and Bluetooth 5.1, the connection seems like it should be reliably solid, too. The buds are compatible with both Android and iOS, with an app to control and personalize sound settings.

Bose's new buds are available for pre-order today at the manufacturer's website and Best Buy for just about $200. They should start shipping out to consumers later this month.",['Caleb Potts'],https://news.google.com,high
Nest Cam IQ Outdoor discontinued ahead of a new Nest camera lineup,"Google's Nest Cam IQ Outdoor has been discontinued as the Google Store has sold through the last of its stock. Don't worry if you were hoping to pick one up, though, as Google also confirms a whole new lineup of security cameras is set to land later this year. However, the recently sold-out model will continue to get software updates and feature support.

Stock for the $399 IP-rated Nest Cam IQ Outdoor has been fluctuating across Google's various regional storefronts for the last few weeks. Google has since confirmed it has ""sold out"" of the product, which will no longer be available to purchase through the Google Store, though it will continue to get updates (as we'd hope given the price). In our review, we found it a capable smart home security camera with class-leading video quality and functionality, though the price tag was problematic — not that it matters now. Although some third-party retailers are still selling them, it sounds like the camera has been discontinued.

That brings us to this latest development: According to a statement provided to 9to5Google, confirmed to us by Google, a new set of smart home cameras will debut later this year. A Google spokesperson tells us, ""Nest will keep investing in new innovations, including a new lineup of security cameras for 2021."" Other details about the lineup weren't provided, but here's hoping they hit a more competitive price than the current models.

Google's clearly been aware that pricing for its smart home suite is a problem, as last year it revamped Nest Aware pricing to make it more affordable on a per-camera basis (though the change wasn't all for the better). Other hardware products in the current lineup range from $129 for the basic Nest Cam Indoor to $300 for the Nest Cam IQ Indoor. That's a lot more than many other Assistant-compatible cameras cost, especially given the random issues they have. Other smart home companies like Wyze have been undercutting Google by a literal order of magnitude on price for their Assistant-connected cameras, so we have to assume Google's paying attention.

Just a few days ago, a new and likely Nest-branded device hit the FCC. We aren't sure what it is, but it's got a screen, Soli, and Zigbee tech inside it — maybe a Nest Secure successor or a new smart display, or both? Whatever it ends up being, it could be a part of the new lineup when it lands. And given the delay between FCC appearance and launch is usually just a month or two, we may not have too long to wait.",['Ryne Hager'],https://news.google.com,high
Facebook overhauls Pages to remove ‘Likes’ and streamline user interface,"Facebook is out today with a major update to Facebook Pages that includes removing “Likes,” an all-new layout for the UI, a dedicated News Feed, simpler navigation, refreshed admin controls for partial or full privileges, new insights as well as safety and integrity features.

Facebook announced the new Pages experience in a blog post and said the overhaul is starting to roll out today. Here are the new key features/changes:

Redesigned layout that’s simpler and more intuitive

that’s simpler and more intuitive Dedicated News Feed to discover and join conversations, follow trends, interact with peers and engage with fans

to discover and join conversations, follow trends, interact with peers and engage with fans Easy navigation between personal profile and Pages

between personal profile and Pages Updated task-based admin controls giving trusted Page admins full control or partial access

giving trusted Page admins full control or partial access Actionable insights and more relevant notifications

and more relevant notifications Safety and integrity features to detect spammy content and impersonator accounts

The new UI is designed to make it easier to switch between personal profiles and public Pages. Facebook says it’s also “cleaner and more streamlined” than before. It has a focus on bios, posts, and important info.

Here’s how Facebook describes the dedicated News Feed for Pages:

We are bringing the power of News Feed to Pages for the first time. Now Pages can discover and join conversations, follow trends, interact with peers and engage with fans. The dedicated News Feed will also suggest new connections — other public figures, Pages, Groups and trending content that a Page or public figure cares about. To make Page conversations more visible to a wider audience and surfaced more frequently in their followers’ News Feed, comments from public figures will be bumped to the top of the comments section. People will also be able to follow Pages directly from comments and recommendations posts.

Another focus is “richer interactive conversations” so the Pages reboot includes a new text-based Q&A format.

No more Likes

A big change with this update is the removal of likes for Pages. Facebook has shifted this to Followers:

We are removing Likes and focusing on Followers to simplify the way people connect with their favorite Pages. Unlike Likes, Followers of a Page represent the people who can receive updates from Pages, which helps give public figures a stronger indication of their fan base.

Admins will likely be glad to see improved management features:

We’ve added new Page management features — like the ability to more clearly assign and manage admin access permissions based on specific tasks. For example, you’ll now be able to grant varying levels of access to manage specific tasks including Insights, Ads, Content, and Community Activity & Messages. This will also ensure account safety and integrity.

Finally, Facebook says it’s using the verified badge to help keep the community safe along with improving it’s detection of blocked content:

We want Facebook to be a safe place to connect with fans, so we’ve improved our ability to detect activity that isn’t allowed on our platform including hate speech, violent, sexual or spammy content and impersonation. We are continuing to expand the visibility of a verified badge to make it easier to identify posts and comments from authentic Pages and profiles. A verified Page’s comment on another Page’s public post, may appear higher in the comments section and be visible in News Feed.

The new Pages is starting to roll out today, but Facebook says it will show up for all users in the “upcoming months.”

The King of Fighters 15 and Samurai Shodown announcements postponed by SNK,"The wait continues

A large portion of the fighting game community were getting pumped up to finally see what The King of Fighters 15 is going to look like after years of waiting, but it appears as though everyone will need to hold that anticipation a while longer still.

SNK announced today that they have postponed the announcements for KOF15 and Samurai Shodown Season 3, which were originally scheduled to take place this evening.

The bummer of an announcement came via SNK's official Twitter account where they state both reveals are no longer taking place as previously planned.

No official reasoning or replacement dates were included with SNK's post though they apologize for the last-minute delay.

This sudden change in direction appears quite strange considering SNK continued to tweet about the event as late as this morning with other company representatives doing the same two hours before the postponement. The announcement also dropped at 1:30 a.m. local time in Japan.

The developers had been promising to reveal King of Fighters 15's first ever trailer for over a month now after they released a short teaser video that showed some early concept art for a handful of characters.

We sincerely apologize to everyone who was looking forward to the announcements. We will inform our fans as soon as the new date and time has been confirmed, and appreciate your kind understanding. #SNK — SNK GLOBAL (@SNKPofficial) January 6, 2021

Returning favorites like Kyo, Benimaru, K', Leona and Shun'ei were all included with December's teaser, and now the wait time to see them in action is once again turned into a question mark.

On top of KOF, the company was also going to reveal the first two characters of Samurai Shodown's Season Pass 3 with one of the fighters being a crossover from another SNK series, The Last Blade.

SNK Producer Yasuyuki Oda previously stated that they're working to make KOF15 the supreme masterpiece of the series and that they're working to use ""new technologies"" for development, but concrete details about the project are still scarce.

First revealed to investors at the end of 2018, King of Fighters 15 wouldn't get announced to the public until EVO 2019, where just a logo was shown, with SNK pretty much going radio silent on the project afterwards until this winter.

This also comes just a few weeks after another piece of odd news out of SNK with the company planning to release a brand new console at some point in 2021, which is possibly the NeoGeo 2 — a system said to be a semi-open platform for games and a successor to the original NeoGeo released in the early '90s.

King of Fighters 15 is gearing up to be a direct sequel to KOF14, which released in 2016 and marked the start of SNK's new push to grab the fighting game market in the realm of HD and 3D.

SNK Heroines: Tag Team Frenzy and Samurai Shodown followed suit over the past few years though many have been eagerly anticipating a new KOF the entire time as well.

Unfortunately, everything is now back into limbo with anything that's coming out of the studio, but we can hope that this delay is a short one.","[""Dakota 'Darkhorse' Hills""]",https://news.google.com,high
Capcom Shares Strict Video Guidelines For Content Creators,"Japanese developer and publisher Capcom has shared a 'video policy' for fans wishing to create content based on its games.

The policy outlines guidelines to be followed by creators such as streamers and those producing Let's Play, walkthroughs and tutorials on video sites like YouTube or Twitch. The company says that it's ""grateful to have such passionate and loyal fans who want to create engaging content,"" but asks that the following rules be followed.

Note that while content creation is very much allowed, there are some pretty strict rules surrounding commercialisation, music, hacking, and more:

I. GUIDELINES

• Creative Content: You may make walkthroughs, tutorials, Let’s Play, speedruns, reviews, reactions, instructionals, and other “commentary” style videos using our game footage to be shared on YouTube, Twitch.tv, your website, or other video/streaming sites. The associated step-by-step commentary should be tied to the live game play being shown, and should provide instructional or educational value, or other benefits.

• Game footage posted online: You should not share game footage online without adding your own video or content unless the game console or device permits sharing of game footage. You may not split our game content into components (visual, vocal, in-game elements, etc.) and distribute such components as separate content.

• Not Official Capcom Video: Fan content may not be promoted as official Capcom content.

• Only Capcom Music: Please note that some game soundtracks or songs may not be owned by Capcom, but instead are licensed from an artist or another group. As this varies from game to game, please be aware that music may trigger content flags and potential removal of the video. Game soundtracks may not be posted or distributed separately and apart from game footage.

• Audience-Appropriate: All fan-created content should be appropriate for the audience of the Capcom games. For example, if you take game content for younger audience and make it objectionable, we reserve the right to take it down.

• Spoilers: Any posting or other unauthorized disclosure of game content prior to a game’s official release is strictly prohibited. Even after an official game release, spoilers can ruin a fan’s experience and we always aim to avoid them. Please be respectful of others and do not deliberately push plot reveals on people who are actively avoiding learning about them; otherwise please offer spoiler disclaimers as a courtesy.

III. IMPERMISSIBLE USES

• Pre-Release Content: Any posting or other disclosure of unofficially released, unauthorized, or leaked video and other leaked content of any kind, in any format, is strictly prohibited. Any publishing of in-game content from sources such as, but not limited to, leaked copies of a game prior to its official release date will be removed.

• Unauthorized Usage: We do not allow usage of or promotion of third-party programs (including hacking, cheating, etc.) or devices that circumvent intended protection of Capcom titles. Additionally, we do not allow Capcom content to be uploaded to a platform for which rights have not been granted (such as in the creation of Twitch emotes featuring Capcom content.)

• Inappropriate Content: Using Capcom titles to create video and other content, including mods, that is illegal, racist, sexist, prejudicial to sexual orientation, sexually explicit, disparaging, promotes hate crimes, or is otherwise offensive is not tolerated. On a case by case basis, Capcom reserves the right to take down content that is found to be inappropriate or objectionable, at our discretion.

• Video Capture of Capcom Publication: Any posting of video capture of printed or digital books and other printed or digital materials published by Capcom or its licensees, such as but not limited to comic books, game strategy guides, collector’s edition art books (“Capcom Publication”) is prohibited.

Kim Kardashian and Kanye West 'prepare for $2.2bn divorce battle',"A look at Kim and Kanye's love story

2004: First meeting

Kim and Kanye first met on a music video shoot when the KUWTK star was working as Brandy's stylist and Kanye was working on a song with the songstress.

At the time she was still married to Damon Thomas, who she wed in 2000, and Kanye was dating model Alexis Phifer.

Kanye was dating model Alexis Phifer

Speaking about their first meeting on the Keeping Up With The Kardashians 10 year anniversary special, Kim said: 'I met him I think in 2002 or 2003. He was recording a song with Brandy, and I was her friend...

'I vividly remember hanging out with him and then they did a video together, so I'd see him a few times...

'He was asking his friends: 'Who is this Kim Kardajan?' He didn't know what my name was'.

She later told Vogue Arabia in 2019: 'This was before you released your first album and you were known as a music producer. I was really shy...

'You thought I was Brandy’s assistant, which I wasn’t. Ever since you said that, it’s everywhere… like “Kim is Brandy’s assistant.” I was her friend and stylist. [laughs]...

'I thought you were attractive, nice, very charming, really funny, powerful – I was in awe of you, but I was really shy, quiet, and a little nervous, to be honest.'

Later on that year, Kim split from Damon, who she wed when she was just 19 after eloping. She attributed domestic violence for the split - a claim he has always staunchly denied .

Kim wrote in the divorce papers: 'Before we left out home, Damon hit me in the face and cut my lip open.. I fell into the bed frame and banged my knee hard. I was limping when we went skydiving.'

Sealing the deal: West's crush on Kardashian only grew over the years as the rising star began getting photographed next to her boss-turned-friend Paris Hilton; Paris and Kim pictured in 2006

2006: Heads turned further

Kanye's huge crush on Kim only grew over the years as the rising star began getting photographed next to her boss-turned-friend Paris Hilton.

In an interview with Ryan Seacrest in 2013, Kanye revealed that he truly fell for his future wife after he got a glimpse of a certain photo of her next to her pal Paris in Australia.

He said: 'I just knew I wanted her to be my girl for a long time. 'I remember I saw a picture of her and Paris Hilton, and I remember telling my boy, 'Have you seen that girl Kim Kardijon?''

Despite his growing attraction to Kim, Kanye went on to propose to longtime girlfriend Alexis in August of 2006.

The proposal was slightly more low-key than his eventual proposal to Kim many years later.

Kanye popped the question to Alexis over a lobster and pasta dinner during a vacation to Capri.

Tradgedy struck the following year however, when Kanye's beloved mother Donda passed away.

Following a number of procedures for liposuction, a tummy tuck, and a breast reduction, the following day she experienced a sore throat, pain and tightening in her chest, before collapsing. A friend who was with her called 911 and West was taken to the hospital, where she was pronounced dead in the emergency room.

After her death, Kanye seemed keen to honour her wishes of his marriage as he said of tying the knot to Alexis: 'I'm just going to go and get married — I'm not going to make a big deal out of it...

'I wouldn't get married to prove anything to anyone. It's for me, for stability in my life, and I'm so happy that I found someone that I really love, that challenges me, that keeps my life interesting, that's just as crazy as I am.'

Working together: Kanye asks Kim to appear in his infamous hip-hop puppet show Alligator Boots, where she would be playing the part of Star Wars' Princess Leia; Kim and Kanye pictured in 2008

2008: A split, Princess Leia and two new loves

In April, Kanye calls off his year-and-a-half engagement to Phifer, as confirmed by Phifer in a statement to People, in which she said: 'It's always sad when things like this end, and we remain friends'.

Shortly after, Kanye asked Kim to appear in his infamous hip-hop puppet show Alligator Boots, where she would be playing the part of Star Wars' Princess Leia.

Although the show was rejected by Comedy Central, Kardashian still had fond feelings for the project as she shared behind the scenes pictures from the set of Alligator Boots to social media in 2018.

Kim wrote on her website: 'We had met before this project (back in 2003), but I would say this is when we first really connected. These pics are SO funny!'

At the time of filming Alligator Boots, Kim was in a relationship with New Orleans Saints running back Reggie Bush, who she started dating in 2007.

Meanwhile, Kanye became involved with model Amber Rose in September of that year.

Future couple? In February, Kim and Kanye reunite with one another at the Y-3 show in New York City. Kim attended the show with boyfriend Reggie, while Kanye arrived solo and snagged a seat next to the couple and actress Milla Jovovich

'And I was the class clown that always kept you laughing / We were never meant to be, baby we just happened'.

Kanye and Amber also part ways in July of that year

2010: The end of two love stories

In March, after three years of dating, Kim and Reggie split up for good. Reports at the time blamed the pressures of fame.

An insider told e! online: 'They do truly love each other and there's no bad blood... They're even open to the idea of reconciling down the road, but need to be apart right now.'

Kanye and Amber also part ways in July of that year.

Following their split, Amber blamed Kim for the split, saying: 'Kim is one of the main reasons why me and Kanye are not together. She's a homewrecker!'

In the years after his split from Amber, Kanye has openly criticised the model - most famously saying in a 2015 interview that he had to take '30 showers' after dating her and reportedly branding her a 'prostitute'.

In December, as Kim filmed the music video for her single Jam (Turn It Up), Kanye was present on set. Famously, Kardashian's mother Kris Jenner snapped at him for checking out her daughter's famous derriere by bluntly saying, 'Don't be looking at her a**'.

The songwriter snapped back: 'I've never seen it actually.'

Kim later revealed that she had misgivings about the marriage but felt she must go forward due to surrounding pressures.

She said: 'There was all this attention on the wedding, and I thought 'maybe it was just the pressure of the show giving me this anxiety.'

'The night before, my mom pulled me aside, off camera, and was like, 'This isn't it for you,''

'I felt like, if I pulled out now, everyone's going to think I just did it for the show. Then afterwards, people were saying, 'You have to stay married for a year,' but I physically couldn't do it. When I made the decision [to divorce], everyone said it was made up for the show. Everyone really wanted to take me down.'

Kris said of the split: ''It's never easy to go through the embarrassment of something like that — with your friends, with your family …. But when it plays out so publicly, in front of the world, it's a whole other level. It was brutal'.

During his appearance on Kocktails with Khloe, Kanye revealed to Khloe that he tried to talk Kim out of moving forward with her marriage to Kris.

Shortly after, rumors began to swirl that Kim had taken her friendship with Kanye to the next level.

Early snap: Kim confirmed her romance with Kanye in June 2012 and they announced they were expecting their first child that December

In December, Kim and Kanye welcomed their second child, son Saint West, on December 5, 2015.

Eager to share her newborn with her massive Instagram following, Kim shared a portrait of Saint to the platform.

Kim later discussed life with two young children, saying of North: 'I don't know if it's because she's the older sister. I don't know what it is. I thought it was a phase. She does not like her brother and it's so hard for me...

'She would get so jealous when I would breastfeed and all that kind of stuff. And now, the phase isn't going away.'

Famed and adored for her seeming diva ways, Kim continued to give insight into life with North, saying: 'She thinks she's outsmarting me.

'Like, she'll have a tea party and say, 'No boys allowed.' Dad can't come too then -- no boys. And she'll slam the door on her brother's face and he'll just start crying.'

2016: Kim's trauma and trouble in paradise

In 2016, Kim was left traumatised when burglars broke into her Paris apartment during Fashion Week, tied her up and stole $10million of jewellery in October 2016 (pictured before the raid)

In 2016, Kim was left traumatised when burglars broke into her Paris apartment during Fashion Week, tied her up and stole $10million of jewellery in October 2016.

In 2018, she finally learning to be 'okay' with the horrifying experience because she has 'learned so much from it'.

The reality star was robbed by five armed men wearing ski masks and clothes with police markings in the ordeal.

At around 3am, the robbers entered the building after the concierge let them in.

Handcuffed and at gunpoint, the concierge led them to the starlet's flat.

Kim reportedly 'begged for her life' and told the gunmen she had children at home when two of them entered her room and held the gun to her head.

The men stole a jewellery box worth €6 million ($6.7 million/ £5.24 million) and a ring worth €4 million ($4.5 million/ £3.5 million), prompting fears that the valuables were personal ones, and not just jewellery Kim was borrowing for fashion week.

Kim also lost two of her prized smart phones – ones that are likely to contain a great deal of personal information.

As she recovered from the trauma of the robbery, Kim faced further plight when later that year, the couple were faced with allegations of 'friction' due to Kanye's online behaviour.

After Kanye went on a number of Twitter tangents, insiders said: ' What causes friction in the marriage, however, is Kanye's compulsive tweeting.

'Kim can't stand it. She is all for self-promotion, but doesn't approve of Twitter drama'.

Despite this, they denied they were having issues with Kim saying 'there's just nothing to really report on'.

2017: Baby number three

The couple hired a surrogate to carry their third child. It was first reported in July that Kim opted to go the surrogate route due to health complications during her first two pregnancies

The couple hired a surrogate to carry their third child. It was first reported in July that Kim opted to go the surrogate route due to health complications during her first two pregnancies.

Kim, who suffered with life threatening placenta accreta when carrying North and Saint, is said to have been referred 'by an agency' to find the right surrogate.

TMZ claimed the famous duo paid $45,000 for the surrogate to carry their third child, before revealing the lady in question is an African-American college graduate in her Twenties who has been married for five years with two children.

'The entire family is over the moon. Kim had been looking for a surrogate for months until recently when she found the perfect candidate,' a source told People.

The singer added: 'They want everything to be perfect and for the baby to be extremely healthy.

'They don't want any complications and Kim is providing an ideal eating regimen and diet so everyone knows what the baby is consuming before it's born.'

Prior to hiring their surrogate, Kim spoke to her sister Kourtney about the perks of surrogacy, saying: ''If you use a surrogate, nobody has to know the whole time...

'You could have a baby for a year and nobody would even know.'

2018: Chicago is here

In January, their daughter Chicago was born

In January, their daughter Chicago was born.

Kim delightedly announced the news, confirming in a statement : 'We're so in love. Kanye and I are happy to announce the arrival of our healthy, beautiful baby girl'.

Three days after the birth, Kim revealed that the couple had decided to call their newborn daughter Chicago.

She shared a picture of the name, captioned with the date and time of the tot's birth, plus her weight – 7lbs, 6oz.

She shared a post which explains how to pronounce the shortened version of Chicago's name.

The informative messages said: 'And to everyone who thinks it's literally pronounced as CHI. No. It's 'Shy'.'

When grilled on the unusual name: 'Everyone asks me where we came up with that,' Kim said about her baby girl, whom she regularly calls 'Chi.

'Kanye is originally from Chicago, and the city is really connected to his memory of his mom. So, we went with Chicago.'

2019: The brood continues to grow and Sunday Service arrives

In May, they then welcomed another son Psalm West by a surrogate and later renewed their wedding vows

In May, they then welcomed another son Psalm West by a surrogate and later renewed their wedding vows.

She announced Psalm's arrival on Mother's Day with a picture of the baby asleep.

Kris later explained what the name meant, saying: 'The inspiration was the Book of Psalms in the Bible. I think it's just a wonderful way to celebrate how they feel. And he's such a blessing, so it's perfect. He's just adorable.'

Kim had spoken earlier about moving on to having four children.

She said: 'I think that, [for] anyone that has three, I do recommend going for the fourth. You're already there. You're so close. It feels so balanced. It feels like there's a partner for everyone—no one's left out. Everyone gets along now.'

The biblical name came around the same time as the launch of Kanye's Sunday Service, in which he delivered his own religious service each Sunday at his home since the beginning of 2019.

Kim discussed the services and detailed what they meant to Kanye, saying: ''Kanye started this, I think, just to heal himself. It was a really personal thing, and it was just friends and family...

'He has had an amazing evolution of being born again and being saved by Christ...

'For the most part, it's just a musical ministry. Kanye doesn't have his 501 [registered non-profit exempt from federal tax] yet to make it an official church, but it is for God and it is a Christian church. It started off healing for him and it's become something that he really wants to share for everybody else.'

Kanye himself spoke about Sunday Service, telling David Letterman: 'It was really an idea that we had to open up our hearts and make music that we felt was as pure and as positive as possible...

'And just do it for an hour every Sunday. And just have somewhere where people can come together and just feel good with their families.'

On July 4, Kanye announced he was entering the 2020 presidential race and Kim - as well as Elon Musk - backed him

2020: Kanye's troubles and Kim's birthday

On July 4, Kanye announced he was entering the 2020 presidential race and Kim - as well as Elon Musk - backed him.

Later that month, on July 19 he held a campaign rally in South Carolina, wearing a bullet-proof jacket marked 'security' and with '2020' shaved into his head.

In a rambling speech, he revealed he and Kim had considered aborting North and also claimed abolitionist Harriet Tubman 'never actually freed the slaves'.

On July 22, he fired off a series of tweets claiming Kim was trying to have him locked up on medical grounds, that he had been 'trying to get divorced' since Kim allegedly met rapper Meek Mill at the Waldorf Hotel and called mother-in-law Kris Jenner 'Kris Jong-Un'.

Kim subsequently released a statement saying Kanye was suffering a bi-polar episode at the time. It was later revealed he was holing up at his Wyoming ranch and Kim was seen in tears as she visited him,

In October, Kim and Kanye through the stunner an elaborate 40th birthday festivities, which included dinner at candlelight with her nearest and dearest on a private island.

After the event, Kim shed light on some of the precautions she had everyone take in order to safely celebrate her big day, which included a two week quarantine prior to the party.

She penned: '40 and feeling so humbled and blessed. There is not a single day that I take for granted, especially during these times when we are all reminded of the things that truly matter,' she wrote.

Virtual: Kim Kardashian revealed on Thursday that she received a hologram of her late father Robert from husband Kanye West , in celebration of her 40th birthday

'For my birthday this year, I couldn't think of a better way to spend it than with some of the people who have helped shaped me into the woman I am today. Before COVID, I don't think any of us truly appreciated what a simple luxury it was to be able to travel and be together with family and friends in a safe environment...

'After 2 weeks of multiple health screens and asking everyone to quarantine, I surprised my closest inner circle with a trip to a private island where we could pretend things were normal just for a brief moment in time. We danced, rode bikes, swam near whales, kayaked, watched a movie on the beach and so much more.

'I realize that for most people, this is something that is so far out of reach right now, so in moments like these, I am humbly reminded of how privileged my life is. #thisis40.'

During the trip, she received a hologram of her late father Robert from husband Kanye.

Famed attorney Robert Kardashian, who tragically passed away from esophageal cancer in July of 2003 at the age of 59, was brought back to virtual life for the unconventional gift, which a number of fans have branded 'creepy'.

Among the statements made by the virtual incarnation of the late Kardashian patriarch were that his famous daughter was 'all grown up', while he also hailed Kanye, 43, as 'the most genius man in the whole world'.

The two-and-a-half minute video showed the late Kardashian wearing a beige suit jacket layered over a crisp white dress shirt as he seemingly spoke directly to Kim.

'Happy Birthday Kimberly,' greeted the hologram. 'Look at you! You're 40 and all grown up. You look beautiful just like when you were a little girl. 'I watch over you and your sisters and brother and the kids everyday. Sometimes I drop hints that I'm around,' noted hologram Robert, who made reference to something the Kardashians refer to as a 'big peefee'.

2021: The end?

The couple have been rocked by claims that their six-year marriage is over, with sources saying 'divorce is imminent' for the power couple.

Several sources have claimed that Kim is preparing to file for divorce from her rapper husband while he is said to be fed up with the whole Kardashian clan.

The rumors of a split follow a rocky year for the couple where they were spotted having 'crisis' talks after Kanye accused Kim of trying to 'lock me up' and said he wanted to divorce her in a series of rambling Twitter posts while he was said to be in the grips of a bipolar episode.

Kanye also made a failed run for the White House in 2020 and during his first presidential campaign rally told attendees that Kim had considered aborting daughter North.","['Sarah Sotoodeh', 'Sarah Sotoodeh For Dailymail.Com']",https://news.google.com,high
Gwen Stefani Masters the Thigh-High Boot Trend in Skinny Jeans & a Denim Bustier,"If you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, we may receive an affiliate commission.

Gwen Stefani proved once more why she is the master of the thigh-high boot trend in one of her boldest footwear looks to date.

For last night’s performance on “The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon,” the No Doubt alumna took the stage in a combined fringe, glitter and denim look. The outfit included a fringed jacket, skinny jeans and a matching wrap skirt from LouLou the Brand as well as custom pieces from her favorite accessories brand, Object & Dawn.

To bring the look to the next level, Stefani slipped her jeans into a pair of the slickest thigh-high boots. The tall blue latex design hit over mid-thigh with a sleek pointed-toe silhouette and a lifted stiletto finish.

Thigh-high boots have quickly become the must-have boot silhouette this season. From leather twists on the trend to edgy lace-up styles, you can find the daringly high shoes on everyone from Ciara to Lily Collins and Khloe Kardashian amongst other major stars. In colder temperatures, the silhouette offers coverage to counter shorter hems of skirts and shorts as well as provides an extra layer to any leggings or jeans look.

Watch on FN

The “Let Me Reintroduce Myself” oftentimes opts for a tall boot look. For her Global Citizen Prize Awards performance in December, for example, she teased an ensemble with a little help from her stylists, Rob Zangardi and Mariel Haenn. For the show, the musician modeled a leather mini skirt and matching overshirt set that came coated in mirrored rhinestones. The set comes from David Koma with similar skirts retailing for $1,820 and similar tops available for $1,170 at FWRD.

As for Gwen Stefani herself, the singer’s style can be described as punk rock-chic, always including a twist of glam. Whether she’s in Sophia Webster butterfly sandals or Crocs camouflage clogs, the “Sweet Escape” singer knows how to pull off an unexpected style. Her go-to brands include Gucci, Philipp Plein, Vans and more when it comes to footwear.

She also introduced her own line of apparel L.A.M.B. in 2003 and has partnered with L’Oreal, Revlon and Tura GX for campaigns and collaborative collections. Stefani’s career has also extended into the television world with a role judging new musical talent on “The Voice” once more this season alongside her new fiancé Blake Shelton as well as Kelly Clarkson and John Legend.

"Zack Snyder Reveals Unused, Gruesome Elseworlds Wonder Woman Photo","Zack Snyder has shared a historical photo of Wonder Woman that depicts a ""war-weary Diana"" holding three decapitated heads.

Have you seen Wonder Woman? YES NO

Image credit: Stephen Berkman via Zack Snyder.

DC Extended Universe: Every Upcoming Movie 30 IMAGES

The image was prominently placed in the backdrop of Snyder's office during a virtual interview that he participated in with ComicBook Debate , where he discussed his version of Justice League and the movement that led to the release of the Snyder Cut on HBO Max. However, the sepia snap quickly became the main topic of interest amongst fans who were eager to take a closer look at the photo.Snyder later posted a hi-res version of the Wonder Woman 1854 image along with details of his initial ideas for Diana Prince's origin story. In the Twitter caption, he wrote: ""This amazing image shot by Stephen Berkman of an else-world, war weary Diana, who had chased [Ares] across the battlefields of the world and had yet to meet Steve, who would help her restore her faith in mankind and love itself.""The gruesome photo shows Gal Gadot's Diana standing stoically alongside several other warriors during the early years of the Crimean War, setting her backstory even further in the past than Patty Jenkins' World War I setting in 2017's Wonder Woman. The battle-worn hero is featured at the forefront of the photo, clenching the severed heads of her enemies in one hand and her weapon in the other.This is just one of a few alternative versions of the photo that Ben Affleck's Bruce Wayne could have uncovered of Diana and her team in Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice. If this photo had of been used, it would have set up a very different path for Diana as it would have negated her decision to leave Themiscyra for Steve Trevor and the entire mission portrayed in the Wonder Woman movie.The slightly less-brutal version of Diana recently returned to our screens for Wonder Woman 1984, the Cold War-set sequel that IGN praised for presenting ""a nostalgic look back to a beloved time,"" which we felt ultimately provided ""escapism from an exceptionally difficult year"" and offered the ""kind of bright and hopeful movie the character's legacy deserves.""

Prince George and Princess Charlotte keep falling out about homeschooling,"Photo credit: AARON CHOWN - Getty Images

From Cosmopolitan

Like so many other families across the UK, Kate Middleton and Prince William have entered back into the world of homeschooling their children this week, as England was placed under yet more tight national lockdown restrictions. In an announcement made on Monday night (4 January), Prime Minister Boris Johnson told the nation that primary schools, secondary schools and colleges must ""move to remote provision"" because ""we now have to do everything we possibly can to stop the spread of the disease.""

While clearly necessary for the coronavirus pandemic, the update will not have been the most welcome of news to busy parents, who spent much of last year trying to juggle childcare, education and their own jobs. And although the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have access to many more privileges than most, they too will probably be sighing in frustration about the prospect of having to restart homeschool this week.

The Cambridges' eldest two children - seven-year-old Prince George and five-year-old Princess Charlotte - are in year 3 and year 1 respectively, and therefore require more intensive guidance than older kids might. So it's no surprise that, mid-lockdown in spring last year, William and Kate were open about the struggles they were having with it all.

In an interview with the BBC's Tina Daheley, for the launch of the Public Health England 'Every Mind Matters' mental health campaign, Kate Middleton said there had been plenty of ""ups and downs, probably like lots of families self-isolating.""

Photo credit: WPA Pool - Getty Images

""We’ve had lots of homeschooling, which is challenging,"" Kate went on to say, adding that structure was something of a lifeline to keep the whole family going. ""We’ve kept to a pretty strict routine here at home. That’s massively helped us all actually,"" said Kate, before husband William sarcastically chimed in: ""Yeah, homeschooling’s fun…""

And it seems there's an extra dynamic for the royal parents to handle when it comes to homeschool - disagreements between the children. Speaking during an appearance on This Morning last May, the Duchess said some tension had arisen about the different work George and Charlotte were being given.

Story continues

""George gets very upset because he wants to do Charlotte's projects. Because making things like spider sandwiches is far cooler than doing literacy work!"" revealed Kate. We feel you, George.

But ultimately, despite any arguments, William and Kate clearly found that homeschooling was the way forward. So much so, that they decided to continue it through the Easter holiday break last year so as not to disrupt their routine.

""Don’t tell the children, we’ve actually kept it going through the holidays – I feel very mean!"" Kate Middleton told Tina Deheley. ""It’s just having that bit of structure. And it’s great, there’s so many great tips online and fun activities that you can do with the children, so it hasn’t been all hardcore.""

Well, William and Kate, we wish you luck with round two...

John Fogerty sings about Black Lives Matter on political new song 'Weeping in the Promised Land',"John Fogerty sings about Black Lives Matter on political new song 'Weeping in the Promised Land'

Show Caption Hide Caption Fogerty on writing 'Fortunate Son' song, book John Fogerty now feels energized to talk about his upcoming memoir and the song that shares it's name. ""Fortunate Son"" took a harsh look America's inequities during the military draft for the Vietnam War, and is the title of his upcoming book. (June AP

John Fogerty is back with a socially charged new song.

On Wednesday morning, the Grammy-winning singer and former Creedence Clearwater Revival frontman released ""Weeping in the Promised Land,"" his first original song since 2018's ""The Holy Grail.""

The mournful, gospel-tinged single finds Fogerty, 75, ruminating on the current state of the union, with lyrics about nurses crying and a well ""poisoned with lies"" that seem to reference the ongoing pandemic and outgoing presidential administration, respectively.

Later, in the song's third verse, he sings about Breonna Taylor and George Floyd, Black victims of police brutality whose deaths sparked nationwide protests last summer. ""Shoot you in your bed just like they done before,"" Fogerty sings of Taylor, a 26-year-old emergency room technician who was killed by Louisville police officers in her own home.

Interview: John Fogerty on rerecording classic songs with his kids

He also details Floyd's death, after ex-Minneapolis cop Derek Chauvin knelt on his neck for several minutes. ""Out in the street, on your neck with a knee,"" Fogerty sings. ""All the people are crying your last words / 'I can't breathe.' ""

Fogerty, of course, is no stranger to getting political in his music. He is perhaps best remembered for CCR's Vietnam War protest song ""Fortunate Son"" in 1969, and denounced President Donald Trump's unauthorized use of it at his rallies last year.

Although he wrote ""Fortunate Son"" in the '60s, ""to anyone that listened to the words, it appeared that I had actually written the song about him,"" Fogerty told USA TODAY last fall. ""Of course, I didn't know Mr. Trump at the time, but he was part of that group of people I aimed the song at.""

Fogerty most recently released cover album ""Fogerty's Factory"" in November, featuring new renditions of CCR classics with his three adult kids. The family band recorded the entire 12-track effort at home in lockdown.

""As a dad, I am so grateful that this little postcard from the pandemic is there,"" Fogerty said at the time. ""I will remember this for the rest of my life.""

Is The Weeknd’s ‘Save Your Tears’ plastic surgery a dig at Bella Hadid?,"Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window)

The bandages — and gloves — are off for The Weeknd.

The “Starboy” singer, 30, shocked fans in his new “Save Your Tears” music video by removing the bloodied bandages he’s been sporting throughout his “After Hours” era.

The Weeknd, whose real name is Abel Tesfaye, revealed a dramatically altered face with exaggerated prosthetics that appeared to mimic severe plastic surgery — which fans think could be a dig at his famous ex, Bella Hadid.

“Did Bella Hadid get anything for referring The Weeknd to her plastic surgeon?,” one person tweeted. “Is The Weeknd trying to look like Bella Hadid bc I can see it,” another wrote.

A third said, “The Weeknd is definitely bashing Bella Hadid with the whole plastic surgery themes.”

Hadid has repeatedly denied the plastic surgery rumors, as has her mom, Yolanda Hadid. “None of my children have never done fillers or Botox or put anything foreign in their bodies,” the former “Real Housewives of Beverly Hills” star said to a fan in 2019. “They know better after seeing what I went through.”

In “Save Your Tears,” The Weeknd sings, “I saw you dancing in a crowded room / You look so happy when I’m not with you / But then you saw me, caught you by surprise / A single teardrop falling from your eye.”

The former couple started dating in 2015 and broke up in 2016, but got back together in 2017 after the singer had a 10-month fling with Selena Gomez.

In 2019, just a few weeks after they split once again, Hadid and Tesfaye had a run-in at Catch One nightclub. The model reportedly left after her ex showed up, which could be the incident he refers to in the song.

However, fans are divided about whether “Save Your Tears” is about Hadid or Gomez; some claim to hear him whisper the latter’s name in the middle of the song, and believe the woman in the music video to be Gomez’s doppelgänger. Coincidentally, Gomez released a song called “Crowded Room” earlier this year.

No matter the motivation, it’s clear that The Weeknd is making a statement about Hollywood’s beauty standards.",['January'],https://news.google.com,high
Kristin Cavallari says she's 'back to my old self' amid split from Jay Cutler: 'It feels really damn good',"Kristin Cavallari has no regrets about ending her marriage to Jay Cutler.

In a post on her 34th birthday, she reflected on her year, which included officially splitting from the former football player in April.

She wrote, “33 was a crazy year to say the least. The ups and downs, highs and lows. But I can honestly say it was one the best years of my life. Lots of growth and opportunity. I feel like I’m back to my old self and it feels really damn good. This is 34.”

The black and white photo showed her out to eat with a birthday treat in front of her. In her Instagram Stories, she revealed her children were among her dinner companions.

In the early part of quarantine, the Uncommon James founder and Cutler announced they had split — following an extended vacation with their three children. It got pretty bitter initially, but they seemed to smooth things over and have even celebrated some holidays together as a modern family unit. (He also plugged her latest cookbook.)

But the Very Cavallari star made it clear she was happy with her decision, saying in September, “It wore at me every single day for years. I feel like my whole world is opening up now because of it, and I’m just feeling the best I’ve felt in a really long time. I’m really excited about the future all around.”

She also said they’d had relationship problems “for years.”

And she’s been dating. She’s been linked to comedian Jeff Dye — and he was along for her trip to Cabo in December.

“Here’s what I’m doing right now,” she broke it down in October. “I'm going through a divorce, obviously. My kids will always be first, but beyond my kids, I'm making myself a priority right now.”

And while Cavallari has closed that chapter — and ended her reality show — the drama continues. In a new interview, Very Cavallari's Shannon Ford addressed being fired by Cavallari in a moment that aired on Season 2 of the reality show. Ford also explained her lunch with Cutler last fall, which devotees of the show were going crazy over at the time.

Parents are thrilled to see ‘little brat’ TV show ‘Caillou’ canceled,"Children’s show “Caillou” is officially dead. And parents are dancing on the “little brat’s” grave.

“We’re saying farewell to @cailloudhx,” PBS Kids announced in a tweet along with tips “for what to do when your child’s favorite media goes away.”

But it seems the bald cartoon character was the least-favorite animated star among moms and dads everywhere, who have been celebrating online since the news of the show’s cancellation broke.

“Caillou’s reign of terror is over!!” wrote one relieved viewer on Twitter, while other Caillou-skeptics’ complaints have included that the tot is a bootleg Charlie Brown, called him a “little brat” and “evil.”

Another soberly added, “You won’t be missed.”

The show first aired in 1997 on Teletoon, and new episodes were released until 2010, after which Caillou reruns ruled the popular-kids station — until recently.

The perennial 4-year-old clearly did not win over the hearts of the millennial parent set. Per the show’s theme song, Caillou enjoys exploring his fictional world on Pine Street along with his parents, friends, grandparents, pets and puppet pals. The show included segments to teach young ones how to brush their teeth, the days of the week, and how to work through temper tantrums and sibling squabbles, which the titular character apparently struggled with throughout the five seasons the show aired.

“Growing up is not so tough, ‘cept when I’ve had enough,” sings Caillou in the show’s theme song sequence, which shows the tot throwing toys and beating his fists on the bathroom floors. Videos circulating online show Caillou pinching his baby sister Rosie, and whining to his mother. Some parents admit that Caillou’s bad behavior on-screen caused them to ban the Canadian series from their home.

“This is the one show he wasn’t allowed to watch,” wrote one mother. Another PBS-reared adult reminisced, “This show was banned in my house and many of my friends!”

Caillou was not without his professional critics either. One op-ed from Canadian newspaper the National Post categorized Caillou as a “shameless whiner,” adding that the toon, “turn[s] the show’s young viewers into shrill monsters.”

With the cancellation kicking off 2021, parents are relieved to see that Caillou is finally getting the punishment they believe he deserved all along.

Caillou passes the torch to a few more recent and more popular PBS cartoon characters including Daniel the Tiger, a former supporting character from “Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood”; Pinkalicious, the co-star of “Pinkalicious & Peterrific”; and Molly, a 10-year-old Alaska-native protagonist of “Molly of Denali.”",['January'],https://news.google.com,high
'Puppy Bowl': How Animal Planet pulled off a 'supersized' COVID-era game,"'Puppy Bowl': How Animal Planet pulled off a 'supersized' COVID-era game

Patrick Ryan | USA TODAY

Show Caption Hide Caption 'Puppy Bowl' exclusive: Whitney Cummings auditions four-legged friends Comedian Whitney Cummings takes rescue puppies through agility tests to compete in the ""Puppy Bowl,"" Animal Planet's annual Super Bowl event. Discovery

Not even a global pandemic can stop teams Ruff and Fluff.

On Super Bowl Sunday, nearly six dozen mischievous mutts will hit the field for the 17th annual ""Puppy Bowl"" on the new Discovery+ streaming service and Animal Planet (2 EST/11 PST), which drafts pint-sized pooches for a playful ""game"" of football. Photos of next month's starting lineup are premiering exclusively on usatoday.com.

Despite production shutdowns across Hollywood amid COVID-19 safety concerns, Animal Planet still managed to pull off a fur-filled event even bigger than before.

Discovery+: How does it compare to other streaming services?

Typically taped on a cozy Manhattan soundstage in early October, this year's ""Puppy Bowl"" relocated to a hockey arena in upstate Glens Falls, New York, to accommodate social distancing. As a result, the puppies had a much larger field to play on when the game taped last fall.

""We're finally shooting in a real sporting venue, even though we are technically a fake sporting event,"" says longtime ""ruffaree"" Dan Schachner. ""The scale of it is immense – it looks like a completely different show. It's a supersized version of 'Puppy Bowl,' even though we have fewer dogs.""

""Puppy Bowl"" usually features about 100 dogs, all of whom are adopted by the time the show airs on Feb. 7. This year's game has 70 puppy players from 22 shelters, mostly from the northeast rather than nationwide.

""We had to restrict ourselves to shelters within driving distance,"" says Erin Wanner, Animal Planet's senior VP of production. ""We also needed to keep the number of puppies lower because all the puppies come with shelter reps, and we were trying to keep the number of overall human beings down as much as possible.""

COVID-19: How the virus is impacting your favorite TV shows

People on set wore masks and were tested regularly during the weeklong shoot – a break from the usual one- to two-day day taping schedule. Production moved more slowly, with fewer staffers on hand to wash toys between takes and clean dog poop off the field. But the bare-bones approach had some advantages.

""The biggest thing we noticed is that with fewer toys there were fewer distractions,"" Schachner says. ""This is going to sound ridiculous, but it was closer to human football. The puppies were focused on one ball or toy as opposed to 20. Plus, they were distanced (beforehand) and didn't really meet each other and get to socialize the way they do in prior years, so maybe that made them more focused when they were on set.""

The show also has been bumped up from two hours to three, with new segments spotlighting adoption stories and puppies available to adopt from local rescue groups across the country.

""Dogs really are the silver lining of this crazy year,"" Schachner says. ""Adoptions have seen a huge uptick in shelters across the country. They can't keep up with demand."" The New York-based actor and his family have fostered roughly three dozen dogs, including Bluey, an American Staffordshire terrier/Siberian Husky mix and player for Team Ruff in this year's bowl.

Fostering is ""a wonderful experience,"" Schachner says. ""It allows us to meet a variety of different dogs from all different walks of life and backgrounds, and get them ready for their forever homes.""",['Patrick Ryan'],https://news.google.com,high

The actress took to Instagram earlier this month with a funny New Year meme of rock band Ramones, but was flooded with criticism over her relationship with the musician, who she is working with on the film she is directing, Don't Worry Darling.

Some of the One Direction star's followers claimed the mother-of-two 'stole' him from them and slammed their decision to advance from colleagues to lovers, while others defended their romance and branded the hate 'embarrassing'.

Screen star Olivia's post read: '2020, 24 hours to go' - a funny spin on Ramones' 1978 hit track I Wanna Be Sedated.

Stepping out: Harry and Olivia made their debut as Hollywood's hottest new power couple over the weekend as they arrived holding hands at his agent's wedding in Montecito, California

One cruelly questioned the professionalism of Olivia's psychological horror movie, which sees her new beau step into the leading role of Jack, who hides a dark secret from his wife Alice (Florence Pugh).

He took over Shia LaBeouf’s role as Florence's love interest in September last year, and it is his first screen role since the 2017 movie Dunkirk.

They said: 'Dating a Co star and an employee isnt very professional from you ...the movie should be called Harry and olivia'. (sic)

Others agreed: 'So… Harry Styles got the part because he sleeps with the director? LOL.

'And now we know how he got the part in the film... Did you slept with harry and you gave him the part? and you split with your husband bcoz you want to date harry?' (sic)

Taking a spin: The group were later seen in Harry's white vintage 1966 Mercedes SL230, which he lent to his agent and his new-wife at their wedding over the weekend

Passengers: Harry and Olivia looked cosy as they sat in the passenger seats together for the drive

Close: The pair are said to have 'grown close' while filming Don't Worry Darling in recent weeks, and have even spent time living together at a house near Palm Springs owned by TV host James Corden, who is a long-time friend of Harry's

'Secret': The happy photos comes amid claims James Corden helped keep Harry and Olivia's 'romance a secret' after allowing the singer to stay in his home while filming Olivia's new movie, Don't Worry Darling, in Palm Springs, California

Loyal friend: It has been claimed that Harry's celebrity pal and The Late Late Show host James, 42, helped the duo keep their romance a 'secret' after allowing Harry to stay at his home near Palm Springs during filming where he was 'able to be alone' with Olivia.

'Girlfriend': While a source told the publication that the duo 'fell for each other' on the set of her movie Don't Worry Darling, with the singer reportedly introducing Olivia as his 'girlfriend' at the wedding

Another troll ridiculed Harry's past relationships, as well as the New Yorker's eight-year romance with Jason Sudeikis, with whom she shares son Otis, six, and daughter Daisy, four.

They said: 'I know Harry have a thing for older women not a mummy with 2 babies... YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF WHAT YOU'RE DOING... DATING A BOY WHO'S WORKUNG FOR YOU!' (sic)

However, a legion of the songwriter's loyal fanbase urged the naysayers to stop writing negative comments on Olivia's page, especially after Harry recently released the music video to his track Treat People with Kindness (TPWK).

Treat People with Kindness is a slogan the media personality first used to promote love and acceptance during his debut concert tour in 2017.

A source told Page Six: 'This relationship between Harry and Olivia is very new. Olivia has been directing Harry in the movie in Palm Springs, and there were literally 10 people on the set, because they were strictly adhering to COVID rules.'

They added: 'Harry had been staying at James Corden's house near Palm Springs during filming, and so they were able to be alone and keep their relationship very secret.'

Lovely: 'So everyone was really surprised — and rather delighted — when Harry brought Olivia as his date to the wedding, and introduced her as his girlfriend,' the source added to the publication

Moving on: Olivia was engaged to fiancé Jason Sudeikis, 45, for over eight years but it was reported in November 2020 that they had split earlier in the year, with nothing to suggest that Harry had any involvement in the decision to part

Fans penned: 'Clearly some of you in the comments have forgotten to TREAT PEOPLE WITH KINDNESS!!!! On behalf of the SANE Harry stans, I'm sorry and this is embarrassing.

'Where's the treat people with kindness? leave her alone. she has done nothing. i'm so sorry for all the hate oh my god.

'Jesus christ please leave her alone.. olivia bby i'm so sorry about these comments ily queen... LEAVE HER ALONE.

'Bestie hope ur well idk why everyone thinks ur business is theirs but... treat olivia with kindness.

Split: Us Weekly reported at the time that Olivia and Jason, who are parents to son Otis, six, and daughter Daisy, four, were 'never going to get married' and often 'butted heads'

An insider claimed: 'There were arguments and fights over career decisions and where to live. Like most couples, they had disagreements, they were bi-coastal but Jason loved living in New York and Olivia, who was born in NYC, was leaning more toward Los Angeles.'

New role: Harry took over Shia LaBeouf’s role as Florence Pugh's love interest in Olivia’s new horror film Don’t Worry Darling in September. It is his first screen role since the 2017 movie Dunkirk

Happy: Olivia recently told People that she 'did a little dance' when Harry agreed to sign-on to her directorial project

'THIS IS SO EMBARRASSING LEAVE HER ALOME,, YOURE ACTING AS IF THOUGH HARRY WAS FORCED TO HOLD HER HAND.

'Everyone needs to leave Olivia alone! So what if her and Harry are dating! He isn't our to claim! How do you think it makes Harry feels that his fans that say they love and support him are here rn hating on Olivia for holding hands with Harry!

'It isn't any of our business where they are dating or not! As long as they are both happy that is all what matters! So everyone leave her alone! And TREAT HET WITH F*****G KINDNESS.

'Y'all need to leave her alone. you preach tpwk until harry is seen with a woman. literally leave her alone, she did nothing wrong.' (sic)

Olivia added of Harry taking over the role: 'To me, he’s very modern and I hope that this brand of confidence as a male that Harry has—truly devoid of any traces of toxic masculinity—is indicative of his generation and therefore the future of the world.'

Powerful: 'I think he is in many ways championing that, spearheading that. It’s pretty powerful and kind of extraordinary to see someone in his position redefining what it can mean to be a man with confidence,' she said

Plot: The psychological thriller is set in the 1950s, and is Olivia's second directorial effort after 2019's critically-acclaimed Booksmart

Harry and Olivia made their debut as Hollywood's hottest new power couple over the weekend as they arrived holding hands at his agent's wedding in Montecito, California.

Harry looked very dapper in a black suit paired with a frilled white shirt as he held hands with his new love while wearing a black face mask at the San Ysidro Ranch.

Olivia stunned in a long boho floral style dress with a pink turban as they left their hotel to join the wedding party, with the actress sporting a matching black face mask.

The pair are said to have 'grown close' while filming Don't Worry Darling in recent weeks, and have even spent time living together at a house near Palm Springs owned by TV host James Corden, who is a long-time friend of Harry's.

The new couple looked happy and relaxed as they walked hand-in-hand, with Harry holding a tumbler of alcohol as they attended the nuptials of his agent Jeffrey Azoff to Glenne Christiaansen.

A source told MailOnline that earlier in the day, Harry gate-crashed the bride and groom's official wedding photographs, with the star pictured holding a tumbler of alcohol in his white robe while the couple posed with the suave Brit.

He also lent his vintage white 1966 Mercedes SL230 to the happy couple and Olivia ran errands in his black Range Rover SUV.

The happy photos comes amid claims James Corden helped keep Harry and Olivia's 'romance a secret' after allowing the singer to stay in his home while filming Olivia's new movie, Don't Worry Darling, in Palm Springs, California.

In exclusive pictures obtained by MailOnline on Monday, Harry and Olivia were pictured arriving back at Harry's LA home with luggage in tow, shortly after they were seen driving around in Montecito in California together.

And now it has been claimed that Harry's celebrity pal and The Late Late Show host James, 42, helped the duo keep their romance a 'secret' after allowing Harry to stay at his home near Palm Springs during filming where he was 'able to be alone' with Olivia.

While a source told the publication that the duo 'fell for each other' on the set of her movie Don't Worry Darling, with the singer reportedly introducing Olivia as his 'girlfriend' at the wedding.

'So everyone was really surprised — and rather delighted — when Harry brought Olivia as his date to the wedding, and introduced her as his girlfriend.'

The source added that Harry doesn't give a 'f**k* about the 10-year age gap and was 'openly holding hands and kissing Olivia'. Olivia, Harry and James' representatives have been contacted for comment.

Olivia was engaged to fiancé Jason Sudeikis, 45, for over eight years but it was reported in November 2020 that they had split earlier in the year, with nothing to suggest that Harry had any involvement in the decision to part.

Dating: MailOnline reported earlier on Monday that the duo were thought to be dating after 'growing close' on the set of their new movie, Don't Worry Darling

A source told MailOnline: 'Olivia and Harry have become close and the pair have been spending a lot of time together in recent weeks. She has been seen visiting his home on several occasions.'

Hitting back: In November, Olivia famously defended Harry's choice to wear a dress on the cover of Vogue, after he became the first man to appear solo on the cover of the fashion bible

Olivia recently told People that she 'did a little dance' when Harry agreed to sign-on to her directorial project.

Splitsville: In November, it was revealed that Wilde and her longtime partner Jason Sudeikis had ended their engagement earlier in the year, after almost a decade together; pictured together in March 2019

Family: Olivia and Jason have remained committed co-parents to their two children: Otis Alexander, six, and Daisy Josephine, four

'[Designer Arianne Phillips] and I did a little victory dance when we heard that we officially had Harry in the film, because we knew that he has a real appreciation for fashion and style. And this movie is incredibly stylistic. It’s very heightened and opulent, and I’m really grateful that he is so enthusiastic about that element of the process—some actors just don’t care.

'To me, he’s very modern and I hope that this brand of confidence as a male that Harry has—truly devoid of any traces of toxic masculinity—is indicative of his generation and therefore the future of the world.

The impressive cast also boasts turns from Chris Pine, Gemma Chan, KiKi Layne and Nick Kroll.

It had been reported that Shia had been forced to drop out due to a scheduling conflict, but in November, it was claimed Wilde had fired the Transformers star for violating her 'zero a**hole policy' on set.

A source close to the production described the actor as 'off-putting' and 'not an easy guy to work with.'

The actor was recently sued by his ex-girlfriend FKA twigs for physical and sexual assault.

MailOnline reported earlier on Monday that the duo were thought to be dating after 'growing close' on the set of their new movie, Don't Worry Darling.

Light-hearted: The filmmaker took to Instagram earlier this month with a funny New Year meme of rock band Ramones

Naysayers: Some of the One Direction star's followers claimed the mother-of-two 'stole' him from them and slammed their decision to advance from colleagues to lovers

A source told MailOnline: 'Olivia and Harry have become close and the pair have been spending a lot of time together in recent weeks. She has been seen visiting his home on several occasions.'

Elsewhere, a source told The Sun: 'They clicked immediately – they're both very artistic, passionate people and it was one of those things where straight away everyone could see they had a spark.

'It's no surprise something has happened, but now they're quite open about it and out and about as a couple. They went to a wedding together with a lot of their friends there.

'Clearly they're enjoying themselves and the age gap really isn't a thing. Harry has obviously famously had a thing for older women but he's just extremely mature himself, you'd never think there was a decade between them.'

In November, Olivia famously defended Harry's choice to wear a dress on the cover of Vogue, after he became the first man to appear solo on the cover of the fashion bible.

Support: Others defended the new couple, branded the hate 'embarrassing' and said their remarks weren't reflective of the artist's loyal fanbase

Author Candace Owens, criticised Harry's choice of clothing and said it made him look weak.

She said: 'There is no society that can survive without strong men. The East knows this. In the west, the steady feminization of our men at the same time that Marxism is being taught to our children is not a coincidence. It is an outright attack. Bring back manly men.'

Olivia then hit back on Twitter and wrote: ‘You’re pathetic.’

Harry has previously dated the likes of Victoria's Secret model Camille Rowe, 30, Portugese model Sara Sampaio, 28, London-based chef and blogger, Tess Ward, 27.

He's also dated singer Taylor Swift, 31, model Kendall Jenner, 25, and late TV presenter Caroline Flack in 2011, when he was aged 17 and she was aged 32.

The singer has spoken candidly about his attraction to older women in the past.

Specifically, fans of Styles unearthed a 2012 interview where he admitted that the only woman 'too old' for him is any woman 'older' than his mother Anne.

The interviewer, speaking on behalf of YOU magazine, was pressing Harry about dating amid One Direction mega fame.

Curious about Styles' personal preferences, the interviewer asked the star: 'How old [of a woman] is too old to date?'

The Watermelon Sugar singer, who is notoriously shy, responded with: 'Any woman older than my mum Anne — who is 43.'

At the time of the interview in question, Harry was just 18-years-old and had already been previously involved with Love Island host Caroline Flack, who was 32.

Styles was first introduced to Flack during his stint on the X Factor in 2010, where he competed with his former group members Zayn Malik, Liam Payne, Niall Horan, and Louis Tomlinson for the singing competition's top prize.","['Olivia Wheeler', 'Olivia Wheeler For Mailonline']",https://news.google.com,high
Terry Gilliam disses Bruce Willis in interview,"UK cult film icon Terry Gilliam took a seemingly routine interview in an unexpected direction — by making a below-the-belt remark about actor Bruce Willis.

The “Monty Python” director dropped the bizarre bombshell while giving a revealing oral — or should we say, anal — history about his 1996 sci-fi classic “12 Monkeys.”

Speaking to Inverse about tapping the “Die Hard” star for the dystopian flick, Gilliam, 80, said, ” I had never been a great fan of Bruce’s before, but I liked talking to him, and I thought, ‘OK, this guy’s smart; he’s funny.’ ”

Then came the shocking anus remark.

“I explained to him my concerns about him as an actor,” recalled the outspoken “Brazil” director. “I hated the Trumpian mouth he does in films. Rectal. It’s like I’m looking at somebody’s a–hole.”

Director Terry Gilliam (right) makes a crappy comparison about his “12 Monkeys” star Bruce Willis.

The film “12 Monkeys,” which concerns a man traveling through time to save the world from a deadly disease, has drawn comparisons to the coronavirus pandemic of late.

Reps for Willis, 65, did not immediately respond to The Post’s request for comment about Gilliam’s crappy comparison.

However, the “Sixth Sense” actor has been accused of getting royally s–t-faced once in Gilliam’s homeland.

Also, this isn’t the first attempt at potty-mouthing Willis of late: Ex-wife Demi Moore, 58, blamed him when her bathroom went viral over the summer.",['January'],https://news.google.com,high
Denmark launches children's TV show about man with giant penis,"John Dillermand has an extraordinary penis. So extraordinary, in fact, that it can perform rescue operations, etch murals, hoist a flag and even steal ice-cream from children.

The Danish equivalent of the BBC, DR, has a new animated series aimed at four- to eight-year-olds about John Dillermand, the man with the world’s longest penis who overcomes hardships and challenges with his record-breaking genitals.

Unsurprisingly, the series has provoked debate about what good children’s television should – and should not – contain.

Since premiering on Saturday, opponents have condemned the idea of a man who cannot control his penis. “Is this really the message we want to send to children while we are in the middle of a huge #MeToo wave?” wrote the Danish author Anne Lise Marstrand-Jørgensen.

The show comes just months after the TV presenter Sofie Linde kickstarted Denmark’s #MeToo movement.

Christian Groes, an associate professor and gender researcher at Roskilde University, said he believed the programme’s celebration of the power of male genitalia could only set equality back. “It’s perpetuating the standard idea of a patriarchal society and normalising ‘locker room culture’ … that’s been used to excuse a lot of bad behaviour from men. It’s meant to be funny – so it’s seen as harmless. But it’s not. And we’re teaching this to our kids.”

Erla Heinesen Højsted, a clinical psychologist who works with families and children, said she believed the show’s opponents may be overthinking things. “John Dillermand talks to children and shares their way of thinking – and kids do find genitals funny,” she said.

“The show depicts a man who is impulsive and not always in control, who makes mistakes – like kids do, but crucially, Dillermand always makes it right. He takes responsibility for his actions. When a woman in the show tells him that he should keep his penis in his pants, for instance, he listens. Which is nice. He is accountable.”

Højsted conceded the timing was poor and that a show about bodies might have considered depicting “difference and diversity” beyond an oversized diller (Danish slang for penis; dillermand literally means “penis-man”). “But this is categorically not a show about sex,” she said. “To pretend it is projects adult ideas on it.”

DR, the Danish public service broadcaster, has a reputation for pushing boundaries – especially for children. Another stalwart of children’s scheduling is Onkel Reje, a popular figure who curses, smokes a pipe and eschews baths – think Mr Tumble meets Father Jack. A character in Gepetto News made conservatives bristle in 2012 when he revealed a love of cross-dressing. And Ultra Smider Tøjet (Ultra Strips Down) caused outrage in 2020 for presenting children aged 11-13 with a panel of nude adults, but, argues Højsted, such criticism was unjustified.

“What kind of culture are we creating for our children if it’s OK for them to see ‘perfect’ bodies on Instagram – enhanced, digitally or cosmetically – but not ‘real bodies’?” she said.

DR responded to the latest criticism by saying it could just as easily have made a programme “about a woman with no control over her vagina” and that the most important thing was that children enjoyed John Dillermand.",['Helen Russell'],https://news.google.com,high
Alex Garland Sets Next Film At A24 With Jessie Buckley And Rory Kinnear To Star,"EXCLUSIVE: With his FX limited series Devs behind him, Alex Garland has his sights on his next feature film. Garland’s has set his next project, Men, with A24 and has tapped Jessie Buckley and Rory Kinnear to star. Sources add Buckley’s deal is not closed but is headed in right direction.

Besides directing, Garland penned the script to the untitled project. Scott Rudin, who produced his previous projects, returns as producer along with Eli Bush and DNA’s Andrew Macdonald and Allon Reich.

The film follows a young woman who goes on a solo vacation to the English countryside after the death of her ex-husband. A24 will finance and distribute.

A24 had no comment.

As for Buckley, sources tell Deadline that Garland met with talent for the part last year; it quickly became a sought-after role for some of the town’s rising stars. Buckley would eventually land the role, after which Garland quickly set Kinnear.

This marks Garland’s first film since directing the Paramount thriller Annihilation in 2018. The film also marks his return to A24, the studio that helped launch his career with Ex Machina.

Buckley was most recently seen in FX’s Fargo and also earned raves for her Netflix film I’m Thinking of Ending Things. She can be seen next in National Theatre’s Romeo and Juliet for PBS and Sky Arts alongside Josh O’Connor.

Kinnear was most recently seen in Showtime’s Penny Dreadful: City of Angels and can be seen next in the next James Bond pic No Time to Die.

Garland is repped by WME and Buckley is repped by CAA, Range Media Partners and United Agents. Kinnear is repped by Markham, Froggart and Irwin.",['Justin Kroll'],https://news.google.com,high
The STAR WARS Timeline Has New Official Eras,"It feels like only yesterday that the main Star Wars saga was split into three official eras. The “Age of Empire,” the “Age of Rebellion,” and the “Age of Resistance.” Well, that all ultimately feels a bit reductive these days, with the new The High Republic era now upon us. Not to mention shows like The Mandalorian, which don’t fall into any of those three categories. So Lucasfilm has expanded their official branding for Star Wars‘ various timeframes, starting with an official timeline that showed up in Justina Ireland’s High Republic novel A Test of Courage.

Not only do we get a new timeline, we get new logos and branding for each different Star Wars era. Let’s break them down one by one; we’ll explain where all of Lucasfilm’s upcoming content fits into the Star Wars canon.

The High Republic

Lucasfilm

The High Republic era is where Lucasfilm’s new publishing initiative takes place. According to Star Wars’ official site, this time period takes place some 200 years before the events of The Phantom Menace. Considered the Golden Age of the Jedi Order, peace reigned throughout the Republic in this time. It was during this era that expansion in the Outer Rim (where planets like Tatooine are) really took place.

The Fall of the Jedi

Lucasfilm

The prequel era timeline, which consists of The Phantom Menace, Attack of the Clones, The Clone Wars, and Revenge of the Sith, is now considered “The Fall of the Jedi.”

Reign of the Empire

Lucasfilm

The era immediately following this one is “The Reign of the Empire.” This represents the nascent days of Palpatine’s New Order, years before the Rebellion was truly active. Solo takes place squarely in this time period, as does the upcoming animated series The Bad Batch.

Age of Rebellion

Lucasfilm

Now we’re into the original Star Wars trilogy years, which still keeps the “Age of Rebellion” label. This consists of Rebels, Rogue One, A New Hope, The Empire Strikes Back, and Return of the Jedi.

The New Republic

Lucasfilm

Now, the era where The Mandalorian takes place is simply called “The New Republic.” During this time, the former Rebel Alliance has formed a new government, hence the name. The remnants of the Empire have been reduced to smaller forces led by warlords like Moff Gideon. As of right now, only The Mandalorian takes place during this time period, but that will all change soon.

Rise of the First Order

Lucasfilm

Finally, we have “The Rise of the First Order” period. This not only contains the events of The Force Awakens, The Last Jedi, and The Rise of Skywalker, but also the animated series Resistance. Of course, we’ve recently seen a metric ton of new Star Wars projects announced by Lucasfilm. Where do all of these fall? We have a pretty good idea for most of them. Let the speculation commence!

Lucasfilm

“Emerging Dark Side powers” are at the center of The Acolyte, set in the end of the High Republic. Books and comics with the High Republic branding take place 200 years prior to the prequel era. With the High Republic’s twilight years only 52 years before to the events of The Phantom Menace, this leads to speculation that we could see the early Sith days of Palpatine.

Lucasfilm

Obi-Wan Kenobi on Disney+ takes place a decade after the events of Revenge of the Sith. That puts it right in the middle of the “Reign of the Empire” era. Lando probably fits here too, should it star Donald Glover as a young Mr. Calrissian. If so, that’s also in the “Reign of the Empire” time. The only “Age of Rebellion” project we know of for sure is Andor, featuring Rogue One’s Diego Luna as Rebel operative Cassian Andor.

Meanwhile, shows like Rangers of the New Republic, Ahsoka, and The Book of Boba Fett will more than likely take place during “The New Republic” era. That said, flashbacks to other eras will likely occur within. Animated projects like A Droid Story and Star Wars Visions are unclear as to where they fall, timeline wise. Same goes for Taika Waititi’s Star Wars film.

Lucasfilm

So that leaves Patty Jenkins’ upcoming film Rogue Squadron. During the Disney presentation, Lucasfilm’s Kathleen Kennedy said the movie will “move the saga into the future era of the galaxy.” Does that mean during the “Rise of the First Order” era, or past it? It would be very exciting to see what the galaxy looks like past the Skywalker Saga. We will have no shortage of new Star Wars content in the next several years. But thankfully, this clearer branding will help make sense of a sometimes confusing timeline.

These Are the 17 Must-Watch TV Shows of 2021,"Last year, as the coronavirus spread and movie theaters went dark, television consumption skyrocketed. (During March, as the Covid-19 lockdowns began, TV consumption for Americans increased from 275 minutes per day to 354 minutes, per Nielsen.) And why wouldn’t it? Even though many folks took up new quarantine hobbies like baking bread or doing puzzles, TV remained a reliable form of entertainment and news. There’s hope 2021 won’t involve quite so many hours of isolation, but that doesn’t mean there still won’t be TV worth watching, especially as new streaming services like HBO Max and Disney+ continue to beef up their catalogs. It’s almost impossible to come up with a comprehensive list, but here are some of the programs we are eagerly awaiting this year.

The Falcon and the Winter Soldier

Look, we don’t know who at the Mouse House looked around and said, “You know what? We need more content on Disney+,” but we’re sure glad that whenever they did, they gave a lot of series orders to Marvel to fill that void. Like WandaVision and Loki, this series is all about the side quests of its titular heroes. There’s also banter. Because there’s always banter.

Release date: March 19, Disney+

Dickinson

Full disclosure: Dickinson is kinda corny. If you don’t like period comedies that are part historical fiction and part YA fantasies where acclaimed 19th century poets speak in 21st century slang, this show is not for you. But if you, like us, enjoy watching Emily Dickinson (Hailee Steinfeld) explore queer identity and hang out with Death (Wiz Khalifa), then Season 2 of Dickinson on Apple TV+ starts this Friday. Enjoy.","['Angela Watercutter', 'Angela Watercutte']",https://news.google.com,high
Kate and William Are No Longer Moving Back to Kensington Palace,"Photo credit: Max Mumby/Indigo - Getty Images

From Good Housekeeping

Kate Middleton and Prince William aren't returning to Kensington Palace after the holidays.

The Cambridges have decided to remain at Anmer Hall, Norfolk, as England enters a third lockdown.

Prince George and Princess Charlotte won't return to school at Thomas's Battersea in the near future.

For Kate Middleton and Prince William, the holiday season is over — and yet the Cambridges aren't returning to Kensington Palace. England has just entered another lockdown amid a rapid rise in COVID-19 cases, and Kate and William have decided to remain at their Norfolk home, Anmer Hall, where they celebrated Christmas. According to the Mirror, the Cambridges have already resumed the homeschooling of their three children, Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis, as they did for a significant portion of 2020.

Kate and William will work from Anmer Hall, with the wider royal family aiming to support charities and businesses throughout England's third national lockdown. ""The family is committed to working together to help the country through the next stage of the crisis,"" a royal source told the Mirror. ""Plans are already in place to reach out to a range of charities and businesses and fortunately they are well versed in the world of video calls now.""

George and Charlotte didn't return to school at Thomas's Battersea this week, despite other children across England initially doing so. Before the government announced Monday that all schools would be closed nationwide, London's primary schools were instructed not to reopen after the holidays. Now, students across the country are unlikely to return to school until at least February, as the BBC reports.

Louis' entry into formal education is also likely to have been delayed by England's school closures: As Hello! reports, the youngest Cambridge was predicted to begin nursery (preschool) this month, following the leads of George and Charlotte who started nursery in January 2016 and 2018 respectively. While nursery schools have not been closed in England, Kate and William have yet to announce Louis' enrollment, and with the Cambridges remaining in Anmer Hall, it seems unlikely he'll start any time soon.

Ranking Packers' potential opponents in NFC Divisional Round,"The top-seeded Green Bay Packers have four potential opponents in the NFC Divisional Round.

Based on the results of the first round, the Packers could play the Washington Football Team, Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Los Angeles Rams or Chicago Bears at Lambeau Field on either Jan. 16 or Jan. 17.

Here’s a power ranking of the potential opponents, based on the difficulty of the matchup for the Packers and in descending order, starting with the easiest matchup:

4. Chicago Bears

Beating a team three times in a single season might be tough, but the Packers couldn’t ask for a better outcome during Wild Card Weekend than a Bears’ win over the second-seeded New Orleans Saints, which would send Chicago to Green Bay. Matt LaFleur’s team beat the Bears twice this season by a final tally of 76-41, including a 41-25 win at Lambeau Field (the Packers led 41-10 at one point in the second half). Aaron Rodgers threw eight touchdown passes and no interceptions in the two meetings, and the Packers defense delivered five turnovers, including three interceptions of Mitchell Trubisky. The Bears gave the Packers their best shot at Soldier Field in the season finale and still lost by 19 points.

How the matchup can happen: Bears win over Saints

3. Washington Football Team

Green Bay Packers outside linebacker Preston Smith (91) sacks Washington Redskins quarterback Dwayne Haskins (7) during the second quarter of their football game Sunday, Dec. 8, 2019, at Lambeau Field in Green Bay, Wis.

The potential worry with welcoming Washington to Green Bay is the defense, which ranked fourth in points allowed and second in yards allowed during the 2020 season. They are stingy against quarterbacks (81.4 passer rating), good at getting pressure (47 sacks) and great in the big situations (sixth on third down, fourth in the red zone), and they’d have to beat Tom Brady and the Buccaneers to get to the next round. The Washington front, featuring top rookie Chase Young, could really challenge the Packers’ reshuffled offensive line. Then again, Washington is 25th in points scored and lacks a dynamic passing game, drastically lessening the chances of an upset. If the Packers’ pass protection held up, they’d likely feel very good about advancing in this matchup.

How the matchup can happen: Saints win over Bears, Seahawks win over Rams, Washington Football Team win over Buccaneers

2. Los Angeles Rams

Jake Roth-USA TODAY Sports

The Rams are tough to figure out, especially with their current situation at quarterback (Jared Goff injury), but they could have the individual pieces and coaching to give the Packers a lot of trouble. The Rams defense ranked first in points and yards allowed and features difference-making players at every level, especially up front (Aaron Donald) and in the secondary (Jalen Ramsey). The offense is an enigma, but Sean McVay is a master schemer and running back Cam Akers and receivers Robert Woods and Cooper Kupp can all create trouble. Matt LaFleur has never faced McVay, one of his closest coaching friends. While the Packers would enjoy a notable advantage at quarterback, the Rams have the pieces around the position to beat just about anyone in the playoff field.

How the matchup can happen: Saints win over Bears, Rams win over Seahawks

1. Tampa Bay Buccaneers

Week 6 already provided an early look at this matchup. The Packers raced out to a 10-0 lead but then fell apart, with two Aaron Rodgers interceptions jump-starting a 38-0 Buccaneers run to finish the game. The guess here is that the Packers wouldn’t shy away from a rematch in the cold at Lambeau Field. The Buccaneers have been up and down all season, but Bruce Arians’ team is talented and balanced, with the ability to score points in bunches and make life difficult on opposing quarterbacks. Tom Brady (40 touchdown passes) provides a veteran passer who can play the dink and dunk game against the Packers defense, and the Bucs’ pass-rush already overwhelmed Green Bay’s pass protection in the first meeting. This looks like the most likely matchup for the Packers, but also the most difficult.

Our Guide To The NFL’s Wide-Open Wild-Card Weekend,"A fascinating — and sometimes-chaotic — NFL regular season is in the books, and the NFL postseason is upon us … complete with a couple of extra playoff teams this year (hi, Bears and Colts). Looking ahead to the opening weekend, we’ll assess each matchup using our Elo ratings — which track each team’s current form, with adjustments for the quality of each starting quarterback — and also identify the phases of the game in which each team was best (and worst) according to ESPN’s expected points added (EPA) this season. Here is our guide to the good, the bad and the must-see for each matchup in the wild-card round:

Tale of the tape: No. 2 Buffalo vs. No. 7 Indianapolis 1:05 p.m. ET Saturday Buffalo Category Indianapolis 13-3 Record 11-5 6th Schedule strength 20th 1725 Elo w/ top QB 1597 2nd League rank 8th Josh Allen Starting QB Philip Rivers 1st QB Elo rank 16th 3rd QB’s supporting cast 5th 16th Avg. QB Elo defense 9th Pass offense Biggest EPA strength Pass defense Run offense Biggest EPA weakness Run offense 75.5% FiveThirtyEight forecast 24.5% Source: ESPN Stats & Information Group

Saturday’s biggest mismatch sees the red-hot Bills host a Colts team that needed help from Buffalo — when it crushed Miami on Sunday — to make the playoffs at all. The Bills have won six straight and nine of their past 10 games by an average of nearly two touchdowns per game. QB Josh Allen finished the regular season ranked third (behind Aaron Rodgers and Patrick Mahomes) in ESPN’s Total QBR, and he has never rated higher in his career than the past few weeks, according to our QB Elo metric. So while Indy quarterback Philip Rivers had a decent year, he and the Colts can’t match Buffalo’s offensive firepower. But one thing the Colts do have is the superior defense — ranking eighth in EPA, to Buffalo’s No. 16 — which offers them the best blueprint for an upset. Playing in Orchard Park, though, the Bills are heavy favorites here, with a 76 percent chance of moving on to Round 2. Elo’s spread: Buffalo -8

Tale of the tape: No. 3 Seattle vs. No. 6 L.A. Rams 4:40 p.m. ET Saturday Seattle Category Los Angeles 12-4 Record 10-6 16th Schedule strength 23rd 1615 Elo w/ top QB 1511 7th League rank 10th Russell Wilson Starting QB Jared Goff✚ 13th QB Elo rank 20th 8th QB’s supporting cast 6th 13th Avg. QB Elo defense 1st Pass offense Biggest EPA strength Run defense Pass defense Biggest EPA weakness Special teams 72.6% FiveThirtyEight forecast 27.4% ✚ Starter is currently injured and may not play. Source: ESPN Stats & Information Group

If both of these teams were at full power, this would be a compelling battle of strengths versus strengths and weaknesses versus weaknesses. Seattle’s offense ranks fifth in EPA, but L.A.’s defense ranks No. 1; meanwhile, the Rams’ offense ranks 19th, but the Seahawks’ defense ranks 22nd. In splitting the season series, we saw each team’s weak link elevate its performance en route to the win. But the biggest factor here is the health of Rams QB Jared Goff, who might not recover from his recent thumb surgery in time to play. Although Goff is hardly a great passer, Los Angeles’s win probability drops by 18 percentage points if backup John Wolford is forced to start again. The low-scoring recipe Wolford followed to victory in Week 17 probably won’t be sustainable against Russell Wilson and company, which helps account for Seattle’s elevated odds. Elo’s spread: Seattle -7

Tale of the tape: No. 4 Washington vs. No. 5 Tampa Bay 8:15 p.m. ET Saturday Washington Category Tampa Bay 7-9 Record 11-5 31st Schedule strength 12th 1477 Elo rating 1642 19th League rank 6th Alex Smith Starting QB Tom Brady 28th QB Elo rank 7th 14th QB’s supporting cast 7th 2nd Avg. QB Elo defense 10th Pass defense Biggest EPA strength Run defense Pass offense Biggest EPA weakness Special teams 29.1% FiveThirtyEight forecast 70.9% Source: ESPN Stats & Information Group

Although things could have been even worse, the NFC East yielded just the second 7-9 team to ever win a division in the form of this Washington outfit. Their reward is a home playoff game, yes, but one against a Tampa Bay team that has been among the hottest in the NFL over the past month. At age 43 this season, Tom Brady posted his best Total QBR since 2016, leading the league’s fourth-best passing attack by EPA. And the Bucs’ defense was even better, ranking third in EPA overall and among the top six against both the run and pass. (Which was a big reason for Tampa’s fourth-best point differential in the league this year.) Football Team has a great defense of its own (No. 4 in EPA), which might help slow Brady down some, but Alex Smith and Washington’s offense should struggle mightily to score against the Buccaneers. Our model gives Tampa Bay a 71 percent chance of moving Brady that much closer to his seventh Super Bowl ring. Elo’s spread: Tampa Bay -6

Tale of the tape: No. 4 Tennessee vs. No. 5 Baltimore 1:05 p.m. ET Sunday Tennessee Category Baltimore 11-5 Record 11-5 24th Schedule strength 29th 1585 Elo w/ top QB 1664 11th League rank 5th Ryan Tannehill Starting QB Lamar Jackson 9th QB Elo rank 4th 15th QB’s supporting cast 9th 26th Avg. QB Elo defense 22nd Run offense Biggest EPA strength Run offense Pass defense Biggest EPA weakness Pass offense 42.6% FiveThirtyEight forecast 57.4% Source: ESPN Stats & Information Group

This is easily the best and most compelling matchup of wild-card weekend. Tennessee upended Baltimore’s storybook season in last year’s playoffs, and the Titans won an OT thriller when the two teams met in November. So there’s a lot of history here. And though they play with different styles, both teams strike an unusually run-heavy offensive profile, finishing Nos. 1 and 2 in rushing yards per game this season. On paper, the big difference between the Titans and Ravens might simply come down to defense, where Baltimore ranks sixth in EPA and Tennessee ranks 27th this year. Then again, that didn’t seem to matter much in the previous two duels — when the Titans’ defense dramatically outplayed that of the Ravens, +1.4 EPA per game to -12.1. In those contests, we saw Tennessee both jump out to a significant lead and overcome a significant deficit, so the Ravens have yet to quite crack the formula for defeating their nemesis. But our model still likes them for the win on the road Sunday, with a 57 percent chance of finally earning their first playoff victory of the Lamar Jackson Era. Elo’s spread: Baltimore -2

Tale of the tape: No. 2 New Orleans vs. No. 7 Chicago 4:40 p.m. ET Sunday New Orleans Category Chicago 12-4 Record 8-8 13th Schedule strength 21st 1730 Elo w/ top QB 1515 1st League rank 14th Drew Brees Starting QB Mitchell Trubisky 8th QB Elo rank 17th 1st QB’s supporting cast 17th 3rd Avg.

In the AFC, an 8-8 record would have finished three games out of the postseason. But in the NFC, it earned Chicago a playoff berth on a tiebreaker over the equally mediocre Arizona Cardinals. Now, the Bears must travel to New Orleans and face a Saints team that looks as scary as anybody in the conference on paper. How can the Bears pull off the upset? Chicago’s seventh-ranked EPA defense could pose a threat to Drew Brees and the Saints offense, particularly if Swiss Army knife running back Alvin Kamara is unavailable due to a positive COVID-19 test. (Though New Orleans ran the ball fine without him in Week 17.) Embattled QB Mitchell Trubisky has strung together four above-average starts in his past five games, sustaining perhaps his best stretch of play since making the Pro Bowl in 2018. The Nick Foles-led Bears even hung tough with the Saints back in Week 8. But the Saints, who had the best SRS in the entire league during the regular season, probably have too much talent for an upset to be much more than a far-fetched notion here. Elo gives New Orleans a comfortable 85 percent chance of advancing to face the NFC’s second-worst remaining seed. Elo’s spread: New Orleans -12

Tale of the tape: No. 3 Pittsburgh vs. No. 6 Cleveland 8:15 p.m. ET Sunday Pittsburgh Category Cleveland 12-4 Record 11-5 27th Schedule strength 30th 1587 Elo w/ top QB 1550 9th League rank 12th Ben Roethlisberger Starting QB Baker Mayfield 10th QB Elo rank 18th 12th QB’s supporting cast 11th 5th Avg.

Congrats are in order for the Browns — their struggles once defied all logic, but they are now headed to the playoffs for the first time in 18 years. And a win in their postseason opener, against the bitter rival Steelers, is not out of reach. Though Pittsburgh impressed with a comeback over the Colts in its last real outing — then took a much-needed week of rest — its late-season form bore little resemblance to the version that blew out Cleveland 38-7 in Week 6. All told, Ben Roethlisberger and the Steelers finished the regular season at No. 22 in offensive EPA, with Baker Mayfield and the Browns ranking much higher (11th). That and Mayfield’s recent stretch of improved play — four above-average Elo starts in five games — offer hope that Cleveland has the firepower to outgun Pittsburgh. But the Steelers’ defense is outstanding, ranking second in overall EPA and No. 1 specifically against the pass; any deep playoff run for them will be powered primarily by that side of the ball. Cleveland can’t say the same, with only the 26th-best defense by EPA. (And then there’s the matter of Browns coach Kevin Stefanski being unavailable for the game after testing positive for COVID-19.) All of that is enough for Pittsburgh to be favored here; our model gives the Steelers a 62 percent chance of holding off the Browns at home in the rematch. Elo’s spread: Pittsburgh -3½

NFL draft top-5 snapshot: Quarterbacks will be in high demand in 2021,"The top of the 2021 NFL draft is set in stone — that is, until picks can be traded. We know the order of the first 18 selections, with the remaining 14 in Round 1 to be determined based on the results of the playoffs.

And what we have atop the draft is a fascinating landscape that could lead to a lot of trade activity. Why? Well, it appears that the most interesting — and perhaps most coveted — prospects in the draft’s upper reaches will be quarterbacks.

But not all teams picking in that range will draft QBs. The Miami Dolphins at 3 just announced that Tua Tagovailoa will be their starter next season. The Atlanta Falcons have Matt Ryan under contract, with nearly $50 million in dead money remaining. The Cincinnati Bengals won’t pick another QB.

So that certainly opens the door for multiple trades in the top 10, pending what happens during the free-agency period. Quarterbacks are expected to be the main trade-up targets. We could end up with three going in the top five overall picks and perhaps four in the top 10.

Then again, that means many mock drafts figure to look pretty ugly. Uglier than normal, that is.

Here’s a quick snapshot how the top five stands now:

A quick look at the top of the 2021 NFL draft. (Amber Matsumoto/Yahoo Sports)

Clemson QB Trevor Lawrence

Lawrence has bid farewell to Clemson in an apparent declaration for the draft, so the first domino has fallen. There will be a new general manager in Jacksonville. Could this be like Indianapolis Colts owner Jim Irsay after he hired former GM Ryan Grigson? Grigson admitted after the draft that Andrew Luck was in essence Irsay’s pick.

Earlier this week, Jaguars owner Shad Khan said that he would retain personnel control for the time being. That can’t sit well for prospective GM candidates. But what would happen if, say, Urban Meyer becomes head coach?

Even if Lawrence feels like a mortal lock to Jacksonville, we’re not putting the chances quite at 100 percent right now. We’ll hedge and say 99 or so.

2. New York Jets

BYU QB Zach Wilson

Story continues

There is a lot of chatter that GM Joe Douglas will look to trade down. But then again, Douglas was pretty vague and non-committal when asked about Sam Darnold’s future in New York. Perhaps Douglas is just playing smart poker. It never hurts to listen to offers and see what options present themselves.

As for the Wilson vs. Justin Fields debate, the one thing we can tell you, having spoken to multiple teams about the quarterbacks this season, is that there will be no consensus. Some like Wilson better. Others prefer Fields. And there are some Trey Lance supporters out there, too. This is going to be fascinating theater to watch everything play out over the next 16 weeks.

3. Miami Dolphins (via Houston Texans)

LSU WR Ja’Marr Chase

Many are mad that I’ve had Chase in this spot over, say, Alabama’s DeVonta Smith, the newly minted Heisman Trophy winner. Readers have informed me that Smith and Tagovailoa were college teammates. Good info; we’ll file that away for certain.

The truth is that I don’t know which receiver the Dolphins favor, and I don’t believe they know yet, either. They’ll take the best player here, regardless of what uniform they wear. Now, is Chase better than Smith? Is there another option that would be superior to either?

Those are fine questions to ask. But keep this in mind: Last year, around late March, there were some reports that came out that the Dolphins did not believe in Tagovailoa. (Go look, most of them are still online.)

So here’s our mock-building tip of the day: If you hear similar reports about a different prospect and Miami this time around, perhaps that’s a sign we should lock that player into the third slot.

4. Atlanta Falcons

Ohio State QB Justin Fields

The Falcons were 0-7 in one-score games. They still have Ryan, and his contract is a boat anchor. Everything in my head is screaming, “no” with this pairing, and yet I think the next general manager is going to have to have a real honest and tough call on the longer-term future of the franchise.

Teams that think too much in the short term tend to fizzle fast. Fans don’t like being patient, and frankly most owners don’t either. This will be a fascinating time for Arthur Blank. But it’s potentially the smartest payoff in the end, with the prodigal son coming home to ATL.

5. Cincinnati Bengals

Oregon OT Penei Sewell

Sewell’s hagiography has frankly been a little too much, at least in some NFL evaluators’ minds. Truly. I’ve spoken to a scout (whose name fans would recognize) who is not a huge fan of Sewell; then again, other people really, really like him.

But my chorus since August on Sewell has been consistent: He’s not Jonathan Ogden, folks. However, if he’s Willie Anderson-level good, certainly if he’s Andrew Whitworth good, Sewell will be well worth it here. The Bengals need blocking help as much as anyone.

Dana White explains how metrics factor into UFC matchmaking strategy,"The UFC’s matchmaking process is a closely guarded secret, but promotion president Dana White revealed that the official rankings are far from the deciding factor when putting fights together on the sport’s biggest stage.

Speaking to Laura Sanko during an online chat with ESPN+ subscribers Tuesday, White explained that, while rankings are definitely considered, fan interest and engagement are also essential to making fights.

“Obviously the rankings are very important,” White said. “We always try to stay with the rankings, and it’s always awesome when you have the champion vs. the No. 1, or No. 1 vs. No. 2. But you’ve seen many times when there’s a fight people want to see, we’ll make it.”

White went on to discuss how the UFC keeps a close eye on statistics and the numbers that each fighter pulls in, which helps decide the types of fights fans want to see.

“We know every number and every little detail that goes into making a fight like that,” White said. “All the kids that came off the Contender Series, I know how many people watched their fights on the Contender Series, and it keeps updating because it stays in the system.”","['Farah Hannoun', 'Nolan King', 'Simon Samano', 'Mma Junkie Staff', 'Simon Head', 'Dave Doyle']",https://news.google.com,high
"Khalil Mack, Cordarrelle Patterson named to PFF's All-Pro First Team","The Chicago Bears are preparing for a wild-card match-up against the New Orleans following another mediocre regular season where they finished 8-8.

With the regular season in the books, Pro Football Focus has organized its All-Pro team. The Bears had two players make PFF’s All-Pro First Team — outside linebacker Khalil Mack and kick returner Cordarrelle Patterson, both of whom were also voted to the Pro Bowl.

While Mack’s pressures and sacks have dipped — he had 10 sacks and 61 pressures — he’s always been more than what the box score indicates. And he certainly was held in high regards by the folks at PFF, who ranked Mack the high-graded edge rusher this season at 92.3 ahead of TJ Watt, Joey Bosa and Myles Garrett.

The pressure and sack numbers don’t tell the full story of Khalil Mack’s dominance this season. He earned one of the highest PFF pass-rushing grades of any edge rusher but a relatively average 61 total pressures. He also has 40 pass-rush wins that didn’t get a chance to become pressure because the ball came out before the quarterback had a chance to feel the heat Mack was about to apply. In addition to his pass-rush prowess, Mack has been back to his dominant best against the run and is a true case study in tape over statistics this year.

Another consistent player for the Bears this season has been Patterson, who has been a dual-threat for this team. While Patterson has stepped into a reserve role at running back, he remains the most dangerous returning kickoffs.

Patterson returned a kickoff for a touchdown back in Week 10, which tied him for the most kick returns of all-time with eight. He averaged 29.9 yards per return and garnered a 89.4, the highest PFF grade among returners.

Cordarrelle Patterson tied the all-time kick-return touchdown record with his eighth score against the Vikings and has an average of 29.9 yards on returns, with by far the highest PFF grade (89.4) when he does bring one out. He was very unlucky in Week 17 not to be rewarded by a really smart play trying to field the ball while he was standing out of bounds to get great field position.

As the Bears prepare for their most important game of the season — a wild-card playoff game that many didn’t expect to happen after a six-game losing streak — they’re going to need their playmakers to step up.","['Alyssa Barbieri', 'Thomas Neumann', 'Brendan Sugrue', 'Ryan Fedrau', 'Managing Editor - Bears Wire', 'Contact', 'Alyssaabarbieri Gmail.Com', 'More']",https://news.google.com,high

“She mad I wanna go hoop on my day off… and we (squad) just got back from long road trip. lol and yes this is real,” Rivers said in his first caption on the Instagram story.

"Canzano: Trail Blazers coach, GM braintrust turning into a stale act","I can’t help but wonder what late Trail Blazers owner Paul Allen would have thought about Tuesday night’s basketball debacle. His beloved NBA team got outworked, out-schemed and out-played by the Chicago Bulls.

Portland fell under .500 for the season.

Anyone think Paul would have been pleased?

I’m thinking Allen might have woken up today frustrated as any fan, ready to do something about it. Neil Olshey, the general manager, ran back a weary roster for this season. Terry Stotts, the coach, feels like a good guy who needs a change of scenery. Together they’ve become a stale act, adequate enough for the last eight years, but nowhere near what this franchise needs for its future.

Olshey’s new contract runs through 2024. Stotts, the fourth-longest tenured coach in the league, is locked up through the summer of 2022. Be sure, those two worked together to glue themselves to Trail Blazers, Inc. in the wake of Allen’s passing. They sold the notion that the franchise needed stability, and it probably did, but now the operation feels like it needs a batch of fresh ideas and new energy.

Food gets stale. Fuel degrades. So does the business of basketball. Stotts may be right for some other upstart franchise, one in need of an offensive spark. Olshey may be perfect for some other NBA city, maybe one with more valet parking. But the duo currently feels like it’s out of good answers.

Since Christmas, Portland defeated three former Most Valuable Players -- LeBron James, Steph Curry and James Harden. But it followed that up with a 25-point loss to the Warriors (Curry scored 62 points). Then, came the short-handed Bulls, who trailed on Tuesday night by 20 but came back to win.

That kind of disappointing swing encapsulates the current era of Blazers basketball. Portland is occasionally fun, but isn’t anything resembling a contender. Damian Lillard’s prime years are being wasted. CJ McCollum deserves better, too. I’d like to see what this franchise might become with a new coach and GM. I’m just not sure, amid the financial uncertainty of a pandemic, if Jody Allen will do what her brother might have done -- clean house and give someone else a chance.

I was alarmed on Tuesday by the post-game comments from Stotts, who said: “Chicago outplayed us. They played harder than us.”

A big piece of that is on you, coach. The metrics for this team, in season No. 9 for Stotts, suggest defense still isn’t a high priority. Also, for a while I’ve wondered for a while if Olshey’s primary focus isn’t as much about winning games as it is crafting the narrative about his own job performance. He desperately wants to be known as a draft-day guru. He hit a home run on Lillard, who the franchise had already scouted and identified before Olshey was even hired. But his marginal picks and misfires often get too much patience, too many minutes, and too much money. Olshey’s vanity has hamstrung the overall effort.

Team president Chris McGowan is a keeper. He’s shrewd, smart and respected. That he’s been promoted to CEO of Vulcan Sports came as no surprise to anyone who has worked closely with him. But the business side of the Blazers has better energy and ideas than the basketball side.

Where is the Blazers’ franchise going?

That’s become a fair question for fans to raise. Lillard turns 31 this summer. His salary jumps from $31.6 million this season to $43.8 million next season. McCollum will make $30.8 million next season. There’s a hefty bill coming due and just qualifying for the playoffs isn’t good enough anymore.

When Olshey ran back Enes Kanter, Jusuf Nurkic and Carmelo Anthony this season, it felt as if it was stuck on repeat. Stotts has a good offensive mind, but the Blazers allowed the Bulls to score 66 points in the second half on Tuesday. Worst of all, nobody was shocked by it.

I expect Portland will still win games in spurts this season. The Blazers won’t be boring, but also they aren’t a true threat to win big. Any good GM might consider shaking up the roster with a shape-shifting trade, but that would mean Olshey admitting he was wrong about some of his prized draft picks and off-season signings. Any other coach wouldn’t first point a finger at the locker room, but that’s what Stotts essentially did.

Allen bought the Blazers in 1988 and stuck with coach Mike Dunleavy through 296 games. He gave Maurice Cheeks 301 before firing him. Nate McMillan got 535 games to try to win. Stotts is now on game No. 648 -- and counting.

Stotts’ playoff record in Portland: 20-36. Same record for Olshey. I’d like to see something else soon enough. Maybe it’s just me but I left Tuesday night’s game thinking, “What would Paul do?” Because his old basketball franchise has gone stale and that starts with the coach and GM.

Schauffele reveals COVID-19 floored him over holiday break,"KAPALUA, Hawaii – Xander Schauffele almost missed his shot at Kapalua redemption thanks to a rough bout of COVID-19 during the holidays.

The 2019 Sentry Tournament of Champions winner was runner-up a year ago when he was unable to two-putt the final green in regulation, sending him into a three-way playoff with Justin Thomas and Patrick Reed. It was Thomas who would ultimately claim the title.

Despite not winning at all in the 2019-20 season, Schauffele was granted a reprieve to try to rectify his sour finish from a year ago when the TOUR opened up qualification for the tournament at the Plantation Course to winners and those who made the TOUR Championship last season.

This decision is a one-off after a chunk of the season was lost to a COVID-19 shutdown, but a welcome one for Schauffele. His excitement was tempered though when his girlfriend came down with the virus in mid-December.

Schauffele was actually at a Callaway photo shoot with Phil Mickelson and Jon Rahm when news came that she had tested positive for COVID-19.

“I got texted, my agent got texted that she tested positive for COVID, so it was a bit of a scare at the photo shoot for everyone,” Schauffele recalled. “I went and quarantined in a hotel away from her and my family for a couple days and I felt totally fine for a couple days but woke up soon after sick as a dog and dragged myself to the clinic, tested positive, and fortunately was able to quarantine at home with my dogs and my girl.”

Schauffele says the pair were unable to pinpoint how his girlfriend picked up the virus and that he was hit hard over the first few days – limited to bed rest short of watching TV and a little PlayStation time.

The 27-year-old had taken a 10-day break from practice shortly before getting sick and as such his preparation for the event this week has been severely limited.

“I tried to walk up a few holes today just as a test. Definitely not in great shape, in all honesty,” Schauffele revealed. “So, I’m kind of in a weird place physically. But mentally, I can fake it until I make it. I'll have to fall back on some good memories from the past couple years.

“I don't know how she got it. We traced everything. No one around her got it. My family didn't get it. So, it's a weird deal. It's a bit scary just because there's so much unknown facts about the whole COVID process.”

The silver lining – if there is any – is that Schauffele displays his best golf when he’s seen as an underdog. It’s a mentality he’s used from day one on the PGA TOUR after being left out of initial conversations that pinpointed the infamous high school class of 2011 that includes Thomas and Jordan Spieth.

“I just like to sleep in that territory there,” he grinned. “I always play well here so happy to just be back playing at all.”

He also featured in a playoff at the World Golf Championships–HSBC Champions in 2019 despite illness before Rory McIlroy prevailed.



""I actually felt worse that week than I do now,"" Schauffele told PGATOUR.COM.

COVID-19 aside, Schauffele hopes to get back to his best in 2021 and get back in the winner’s circle to ensure a return trip again in 2022.

“Last year was a good mental year to build off of. It was one of my more consistent years on TOUR, even though I didn't win a tournament,” he said. “To build off consistency is difficult, but if we can sort of give ourselves more looks like we did last year then keep knocking on the door until you knock it down… that’s the sort of the mentality we're in.”",[],https://news.google.com,high
The Shanaplan: Kyle Shanahan and John Lynch are already recruiting coaches,"It’s no secret that the 49ers will lose at least one coach this offseason, and quite possibly more than that. Who they get to replace those coaches will be a critical factor in whether they’re successful moving forward with a roster that will look a lot different in 2021. Fortunately for the team and its fans, that process has already begun.

Take a look at what John Lynch and Kyle Shanahan said during their final press conference of the 2020 season earlier this week.

Here’s John Lynch:

When you land and you see the beauty of this place and driving in, it’s a rainy morning, but it was a beautiful morning. All the opportunities aside from playing for the San Francisco 49ers and walking by Lombardi trophies every day you walk in the building. I love sharing stories with people about the Harris Barton’s of the world who stayed in this area and translated into tremendous business success because of the contacts they’ve made in this area with so much going on that the focal point for the world in terms of technology and all that. There’s great opportunity. Some people, that means a lot to.

And Kyle Shanahan:

People like the Niners here. Even before last year. It’s a cool place to live in. I’ve been in different places that aren’t always like that and it’s not like they’re just crazy, they have nothing else to do. No, they’ve got a lot going on out here, but they’re very genuine and treat us very well. It makes me and my family and our players enjoy living out here a ton.

As Kyle Posey and Akash Anavarathan pointed out in today’s Shanaplan Podcast, none of that was accidental.

“The 49ers’ brass, Kyle and John, they’re not stupid,” Akash said, “They know they’re going to lose some coaches...and they’ve got to backfill those positions. So now they’ve got to convince someone else from a different team to potentially come to join the 49ers and leave their current situation, so they’ve got to sell the Bay Area. I thought it was a great sales pitch, and they’re starting it right now, which was intelligent.”

Check out the full conversation in today’s Shanaplan Podcast in the player below and wherever you get your podcasts.

While the sales pitches themselves aren’t going to be the only reason someone wants to join the 49ers, the fact that the general manager and the head coach are aware enough to play that game is a good sign. It shows they’re smart enough to see the big picture and try to use every possible method available to them to bring the most talented people to the coaching staff.

Let’s hope it pays off.

"Arthur Blank reiterates that Matt Ryan, Julio Jones may not be back","Getty Images

As the Falcons search for a new General Manager and head coach, owner Arthur Blank continues to send the message that the incoming hires won’t be bound to quarterback Matt Ryan and receiver Julio Jones.

“What I think is important, most important, is that we hire people who are, number one, the very best at their jobs,” Blank recently said during a season-ending press conference. “That goes without saying. Who will come forward with a plan for us to have a championship team, a competitive team, et cetera. And that may include Matt and Julio for now, for the next two years, three years, or may not. I have no idea.”

After the firing of coach Dan Quinn and G.M. Thomas Dimitroff, Blank made it clear that there’s no guarantee Ryan will return in 2021.

“Matt’s been a franchise leader for us,” Blank said at the time. “A great quarterback. One of the leading quarterbacks in the last 13 years in the NFL. So I hope he’s gonna be part of our plans going forward. But that will be a decision that I won’t make.”

Last month, CEO Rich McKay attached strings to the ability to move on from Ryan and/or Jones.

“Give us a plan,” McKay said. “Show us what you want to do and show us why. Show us how this gets us to Ws and make sure you actually execute the plan.”

So while Blank seems willing to defer the judgment to the new G.M. and coach, McKay seems to be willing to reserve the right to object in the event the “plan” for winning without them isn’t persuasive. That plan will include building a roster around a cap charge of $44 million (the cap number for keeping him would be $40.9 million). For Jones, the cap charge to trade him would be $23.25 million; the cap charge to keep him would be $23.05 million.

As candidates interview for both jobs, it becomes critical to know precisely whether they’ll have the discretion to move Ryan and/or Jones, whether McKay will be able to veto it, and/or whether McKay will roll his eyes at Blank if they handle that or any other decision in a way he wouldn’t.

Actually, they should assume the last part to be true. And those candidates, frankly, should before accepting jobs in Atlanta look for jobs elsewhere that give them a straight shot to ownership, with no one else in position to approve or to undermine the decisions that they make in the best interests of the team.",['Posted Mike Florio'],https://news.google.com,high
"Ex-Michigan football assistant Don Brown nears deal to join Jedd Fisch, Arizona","Ex-Michigan football assistant Don Brown nears deal to join Jedd Fisch, Arizona

Rainer Sabin | Detroit Free Press

Show Caption Hide Caption Jim Harbaugh's story: From U-M ball boy to Michigan football coach Jim Harbaugh's connection to the Michigan football program dates back to the 1970s. Here's a quick look at an impressive football career. Tyler J. Davis, Des Moines Register

Don Brown appears headed for the desert.

The former Michigan football defensive coordinator, fired last month, is nearing a deal to take the same position at Arizona under new coach Jedd Fisch, a source told the Free Press.

Fisch and Brown worked together at U-M in 2016 as assistants under Jim Harbaugh. That year, Brown arrived in Ann Arbor with an attack-minded scheme that emphasized man-coverage principles and relied on a heavy diet of blitzes.

THE FALL GUY: Don Brown takes the blame, clears the way for Harbaugh extension

The Wolverines had a top-five defense in each of Brown’s first three seasons at Michigan but slipped to No. 11 in 2019 before bottoming out this past season, when the team finished 2-4 and surrendered 429.3 yards per game.

Brown developed a reputation for maximizing the talent he had at his disposal. In his first four seasons at Michigan, 43 of the team's 44 starters earned All-Big Ten honors. But the Wolverines' struggles against elite offenses and poor performances in lopsided defeats to Ohio State tarnished his record.

Then came 2020, which presented a whole new set of challenges. With COVID-19 a disruptive force, Brown cobbled together a patchwork unit after opt outs, transfers and injuries left his defense threadbare and vulnerable. U-M finished near the bottom of the Big Ten in sacks and surrendered the highest number of passes that netted at least 30 yards.

REPLACING BROWN: 5 candidates to become Michigan's new defensive coordinator

Brown was fired amid a climate of uncertainty surrounding Jim Harbaugh’s status as head coach. Harbaugh is about to enter the final year of his contract and it’s unclear whether he’ll remain at Michigan beyond next season. A multi-year extension has been offered to Harbaugh. But as of last weekend, it hasn’t been signed.

Brown, 65, was the highest-paid assistant in the Big Ten in 2020 while earning $1.7 million, according to a USA Today database. His contract, which was set to expire in 2022, includes offset language that would mitigate the buyout amount if he obtains work elsewhere.

A native of Massachusetts, Brown has spent the bulk of his career in the New England area and on the east coast while rising from an assistant at Dartmouth to head coach at UMass before becoming a defensive coordinator, first at Maryland and then Boston College.

ESPN explains how the Vikings will look different in 2021,"In the Mike Zimmer era, the Vikings have been known to have on and off years.

Zimmer’s teams have missed out on the postseason in even-numbered years, only to earn a berth in odd-numbered years. This year, Minnesota missed out on the playoffs after winning a game in the postseason in 2019.

So there is good news. Each year a Zimmer-led Vikings team misses the playoffs, Minnesota has recalibrated and made it the next time around. ESPN’s Jeremy Fowler thinks that could happen again.

Fowler tabbed the Vikings as one of the teams that will look very different in 2021. When Fowler had to categorize Minnesota’s overhaul, he placed it in the “Surprisingly comfortable despite losing record” category. Here’s what he wrote:

“The Vikings are in a tough spot with DE Danielle Hunter, who is underpaid at $14 million per year. The Vikings planned to pay him at some point, but his season-ending neck surgery complicates matters. Make sure he is healthy and comfortable with his contract, then let Harris walk and attempt to re-sign (Eric) Wilson. Doing any of this will be tough for a team well over the cap for 2021. Cutting veterans such as tackle Riley Reiff and tight end Kyle Rudolph appears in order.”

Reiff is a tough player to let go of, especially after the 2020 he had, but the move makes sense. Rudolph is also hard, but the young tight end unit playing well eases the blow.

The Vikings might have to make both of those moves and not even hang onto Wilson. Re-signing the linebacker would likely mean moving on or restructuring with Anthony Barr. No matter what it comes down to, this Minnesota team will look at lot different in 2021. Does that mean a turnaround season? It’s hard to say as of now.","['Jack White', 'Vikings Wire', 'Kyle Ratke']",https://news.google.com,high
'There’s no rush to sign:' MLB agents bemoan slow free agent market,"'There’s no rush to sign:' MLB agents bemoan slow free agent market

Bob Nightengale | USA TODAY

Show Caption Hide Caption Will the start of the 2021 MLB season be delayed? What I'm Hearing: Baseball owners and the players union have different expectations ahead of the 2021 season. That includes when the season should actually start. USA TODAY

These are veteran agents, most of whom have gone through strikes and work stoppages, but nothing, they say, has resembled this winter.

There have been frigid free-agent winters, particularly the past few years, but nothing has resembled this deep freeze.

Seventy days have passed since the start of free agency, and only 32 free agents who entered the marketplace have signed major-league contracts, totalling $226 million. Yep, less than what the Los Angeles Angels paid Albert Pujols (10 years, $250 million) nine years ago.

There are still more than 150 unemployed players, including J.T. Realmuto, Trevor Bauer, George Springer and D.J. LeMahieu.

The Mets dropped $40.6 million on catcher James McCann, which is $39.8 million more than the entire National League Central Division has spent this winter. He is the only non-foreign free agent to receive more than a two-year guaranteed contract.

The New York Yankees, Houston Astros and Chicago Cubs, with three of the five highest payrolls in 2020, have spent a total of $750,000.

Agents keep calling, and the response is always nearly the same.

Teams say the pandemic wiped out their finances, leaving them with little or no money and certainly not the kind of money their clients are seeking.

“You got to laugh,’’ one long-tenured agent said, “or cry.

“Right now, it’s the latter.""

USA TODAY Sports spoke with 10 leading agents about the free-agent market — their frustrations, fears and predictions. They were granted anonymity to allow them to be candid.

The question on everyone’s mind is what is taking so long. A year ago at this time, according to ESPN, $1.195 billion had been spent in free agency. There hasn't been this little spent in free agency at this juncture in the past decade.

The reason, of course, is the pandemic. Major League Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred said teams lost $3 billion last year. And if teams lost $3 billion in a 60-game season, the fear among owners is what happens if a 162-game season is played with no fans, or at least a limited number of fans throughout the year.

“We all lost money in the pandemic, but they’re all reading from the same script,’’ a West Coast-based agent said. “They say, 'I have no idea what my budget is.’ Every single GM is telling me that. It’s all B.S. They don’t know what the budget is until they sign the player they want. They’re trying to manufacture a depressed market.""

Several agents said they believe teams are attempting to to keep the market flooded so that players start to panic and sign for less than expected.

“Teams believe that with the glut of free agents on the market close to spring training, players start to get real antsy and nervous,"" one agent said. ""The owners know this and take advantage of it.’’

Other agents said they believe the slowdown is also a byproduct of no face-to-face interaction that routinely occurs during the GM and Baseball winter meetings. It's more difficult to generate momentum during zoom calls, conference calls, e-mails and text-messages.

“I’d rather have a root canal with no anesthesia than having a Zoom call,’’ one agent said. “Normally, you get in front of people, get a read, get to know things, and everything is on the phone. It’s just not the same. You just don’t get the same feeling.

“It has thrown the entire calendar out of whack.’’

Said another agent: “It’s just a totally different feeling this year. You don’t have the same dialogue or continuity. Teams are relying on analytics so much now that players are being evaluated the same. If you miss on one guy, no big deal, the other guys have similar numbers. There’s no urgency.’’

MLB: Threatens disciplinary action for teams violating facility access protocols

2021 SEASON: MLB, union at odds on whether to delay start of 2021 season

Starting pitcher Anthony DeSclafani signed a one-year, $6 million contract two weeks ago with the San Francisco Giants knowing that if he hadn’t taken their offer, there were three others starters who could have signed for the same price.

In addition, an active trade market has impacted free agency. Instead of the San Diego Padres paying for Bauer, they traded prospects for Blake Snell and Yu Darvish. The Chicago White Sox traded for veteran starter Lance Lynn of the Texas Rangers. The Washington Nationals grabbed their slugger by trading for Josh Bell of the Pittsburgh Pirates.

The Cleveland Indians are shopping All-Star shortstop Francisco Lindor. The Colorado Rockies are doing the same with third baseman Nolan Arenado. The Chicago Cubs are making third baseman Kris Bryant and catcher Willson Contreras available. The Cincinnati Reds traded closer Raisel Iglesias to the Los Angeles Angels and are letting teams know starter Sonny Gray and infielders Mike Moustakas and Eugenio Suarez are available, too.

“The trouble,’’ one East Coast-based agent said, “is that usually the trading period is over by now. There still are so many talented guys available. So teams are weighing whether they’d rather give up prospects to get a guy or keep their prospects and just pay a free agent.""

The most widespread complaint among the agents is that teams are showing little desire to win.

Aside from the small-market Padres adding payroll with Snell, Darvish and Korean infielder Ha-Seong Kim, no other team has been remotely as aggressive. Most instead are going the other direction.

The Tampa Bay Rays, who won the American League pennant, dumped Snell and let veteran starter Charlie Morton walk away instead of picking up his $15 million option. The Cubs, who have been to the playoffs five times in the past six years, unloaded Darvish and the remaining $59 million in his contract, cut outfielder Kyle Schwarber and are open for business with other veterans.

“The reality is there are a lot of teams that just aren’t going to spend money,"" one agent said. “They tell you they lost a lot of money, and whether you don’t believe it, they certainly do, so it doesn’t matter what you think.

“You look at teams like Tampa and Miami. They probably made money by not having fans in the stands because of their low attendance and operating expenses, but they were crushed by not having that $40 million to $50 million in revenue sharing. Teams like the Cardinals rely heavily on their attendance, and got nothing.

“You look around, and there are 20 teams that just aren’t going to spend money this winter.’’

The team everyone is looking at is the Mets, who were purchased in October by Steve Cohen, the richest owner in baseball. He’s worth at least $14.5 billion and didn’t lose a dime in baseball a year ago.

They are supposed to be the George Steinbrenner Yankees, rounding up every high-priced free agent, and at the least, being used by every agent as leverage.

But the Mets have been cautious, deciding to spend $40 million on McCann rather than wait for Realmuto’s price-tag to drop. They gave a $18.9 million qualifying offer to starter Marcus Stroman and grabbed reliever Trevor May for $15.5 million. They are widely expected to land Springer, possibly even Bauer, and won’t rule out LeMahieu, but no high-profile free agent wants to move as long as the Mets are in the picture.

“There’s no rush to sign,"" another East Coast-based agent said, “because the reality is that money is always available. But what is not always available is rare talent. The scarcity of this rare talent is why players will still get paid.’’

There’s no consensus among agents on whether the biggest free agents will still get their money. Springer, 30, a three-time All-Star and World Series champion, was the player agents most agents consider will likely receive his full value.

“I believe the guys getting the long-term contracts will be safe because teams can back-load deals if they want,"" said another agent. “This has just been a collective slowdown. You can’t blame one team. I don’t believe 50% of what I’m told, but I do believe a large segment of clubs don’t have their budget yet, there are labor concerns, fan concerns, and the vaccination issue.

“It’s natural to have trepidation.’’

So, what happens now?

It’s likely the relief pitcher market, which usually hits a flurry around the winter meetings, will take off once All-Star closer Liam Hendriks signs. He is being courted by several teams.

Will the Phillies’ patience pay off with Realmuto?

Will the Yankees’ waiting game on LeMahieu work, or could it backfire if a team like the Dodgers step up, refusing to give team favorite Justin Turner a deal longer than two years?

And what high-profile free agent lands with the Blue Jays, who are talking to everyone this winter?

“There’s just so much uncertainty out there,’’ said an agent who has represented players for nearly 40 years. “They all want you to take a discount, but you don’t even know the number that you’re negotiating will be pro-rated. When does spring training start? How many games will there be this season? Will fans be allowed in?

“Hey, when you have significant losses in the game — from both sides — and all of this uncertainty, that’s a really bad combo.’’

Leaky Black Making Plays in Miami,"CORAL GABLES, Fla. – In the moments before Andrew Platek drove the baseline to hoist up his game-winner in North Carolina’s 67-65 win at Miami, it was Leaky Black who brought the ball up the court. It was Black who set up the offense, working off a ball screen at the top of the key with eyes looking inside, where Garrison Brooks was trying to establish position. It was Black who prodded the paint, drawing Platek’s defender just enough to make the pass into the right corner.

Platek had his senior moment when his team needed it most, saving UNC from overtime and a potentially devastating loss to the undermanned Hurricanes. Yet it was Black who was most responsible for keeping the Tar Heels within reach on a night when little went their way. This was certainly not UNC’s best performance of the season and was quite possibly its worst. The Hurricanes were down four of its best players, including preseason All-ACC first-team guard Chris Lykes.

Miami’s swarming defense in the paint frustrated UNC’s post rotation, limiting their touches and preventing quality looks on the block. Day’Ron Sharpe scored 12 points on 12 field goal attempts, adding 16 rebounds, while Armando Bacot managed just three field goal attempts. All together, Sharpe, Bacot, Garrison Brooks and Walker Kessler combined for 26 points on 6-of-23 shooting.

Caleb Love and R.J. Davis continued their struggles in adapting to the college game, combining for five points 2-of-14 shooting and seven turnovers. And then there was Black, who two games ago lost his starting spot due to poor defensive performances in recent weeks, culminating with the loss at N.C. State. The veteran wing, who had battled ankle injuries for the majority of the past two seasons, was finally healthy and yet found himself on the bench for not playing up to his head coach’s expectations.

Black acknowledged that decision hurt following UNC’s loss at Georgia Tech, although he chose to accept it as a reality check and a challenge to elevate his game.

“I think he was kind of pissed off at his play,” Platek said, “and he definitely took it personally and changed the way he played, which is major respect to him. If you don't like the way that you're playing or the minutes that you’re getting, if you're not starting, then it's up to you to fix it. I think he did take it personally. This is the best stretch I've seen Leakey play in my career with him. I'm super proud of him.”

Black made his 40th career start against Notre Dame on Saturday and scored the game-winner on a layup with 9.1 seconds to play.

While he lacked the last-second heroics on Tuesday, Black did everything else to help his team win. The 6-foot-8 junior scored a career-high 16 points on 6-of-9 shooting and made a career-high four 3-pointers on four attempts. He pulled down nine rebounds, dished out three assists and made two steals. He was responsible for a pair of turnovers, but provided a highlight reel defensive play on a rejection of Earl Timberlake’s dunk attempt early in the second half.

His biggest shot of the night came with 1:42 to play, knocking down a transition trey to give UNC a 63-61 lead. The Tar Heels never trailed after that basket.

“I think it’s just confidence,” Black said when asked about his scoring display. “I don't think we could play any worse than what we did in the N.C. State game or, you know, last year, so I feel like you’ve got to have confidence. North Carolina’s going to have a game and we have to score some points. I felt like it was a fun night.”

Roy Williams was not willing to credit Black with his best game as a Tar Heel despite his scoring punch, citing defensive lapses and an ill-timed charge that was unnecessary. That’s to be expected, though. Williams has praised Black’s potential more than most of his players in recent years, doing whatever he can to summon that playmaking ability out of his long and lanky veteran before time runs out.

That’s valid, given that Black’s history in Chapel Hill has been one full of promise without the production to match. In fairness, he’s a prototypical glue guy who can defend, facilitate the offense and crash the boards. Asking Black to be UNC’s primary scorer night in and night out would be more of an indictment of the roster makeup and not of him, but he has to be capable of doing what he did in South Florida on Tuesday.",[],https://news.google.com,high
Cygnus cargo ship leaves space station to test 5G tech and spark fires in orbit,"A Northrop Grumman Cygnus cargo ship successfully left the International Space Station for a new mission Wednesday (Jan. 5) to test 5G communications technology and spark fires in orbit.

The uncrewed Cygnus NG-14 spacecraft departed the space station at 10:10 a.m. EST (1510 GMT) after ground controllers released it from the Canadarm2 robotic arm. NASA astronaut Kate Rubins monitored the systems aboard Cygnus during its departure, from her perch on the space station.

Northrop Grumman launched the Cygnus cargo ship in October to deliver nearly 8,000 lbs. (3,600 kilograms) of scientific equipment, supplies, hardware and other things — including a space toilet — to the station. Astronauts then packed the ship full of trash, which will eventually burn up in the atmosphere in a planned (and destructive) reentry on Jan. 26.

Video: Watch the Cygnus NG-14 spacecraft cast off from the space station

But first, Cygnus will allow ground investigators to squeeze a little more science out of the mission – including the SharkSat 5G technology experiment and the Saffire-V fire investigation.

SharkSat will collect measurements and other telemetry from the spacecraft and send it down to Earth, with the aim of further developing Ka-band software defined radio. Ka-band is a less crowded part of the electromagnetic spectrum than the other bandwidths used in space, NASA said in a statement . The investigation is testing equipment such as integrated circuits, multiprocessor systems and digital receivers.

""Potential uses of the technology include various types of terrestrial 5G telecommunications, as well as space-to-space and space-to-ground communications, among others,"" NASA added. 5G is the newer and faster protocol for mobile technology that allows for the Internet of things and other applications, and it continues to be rolled out in the United States and worldwide despite the global pandemic.

The Cygnus spacecraft will also host Saffire-V, the latest in the Spacecraft Fire Safety (Saffire) investigations. Fire's behavior in microgravity is poorly understood, and scientists want to know more about how to predict the growth of fire — and how to monitor it and extinguish it — to improve the safety of future astronaut flights.

""Saffire-V examines fire growth in the range of pressures and oxygen concentrations expected in future exploration spacecraft,"" NASA said in a description of the Saffire series . ""Saffire-V also demonstrates fire detection, combustion product monitoring, and post-fire cleanup using hardware similar to that planned for future human exploration spacecraft.""

Cygnus is expected to operate for about two weeks on SharkSat operations before re-entering the atmosphere, NASA said in a description about SharkSat .

This Cygnus spacecraft is named after NASA astronaut Kalpana Chawla, the first female astronaut of Indian descent; Chawla and six other astronauts died during the Columbia space shuttle accident in 2003 , in which the shuttle broke apart during reentry.

"2021 astronomy calendar: When to see full moons, planets, eclipses and meteor showers","(CNN) Prepare for a year filled with awe-inspiring reasons to look up at the night sky.

There will be full moons, meteor showers, eclipses and planets visible in the morning and evening skies across the world in 2021.

Meteor showers

The Quadrantid meteor shower on January 3 kicked off the first of 12 meteor showers across 2021.

The largest obstacle to being able to see meteor showers that are only visible from certain hemispheres -- apart from your location -- is the brightness of the moon. The more full the moon is, the harder it is to see meteors streak across the sky.

There is a bit of a wait until the next meteor shower, the popular Lyrids in April. The Lyrids will peak on April 22 and will be best seen in the Northern Hemisphere -- but the moon will be 68% full, according to the American Meteor Society

The Eta Aquariids follow soon after, peaking on May 5 when the moon is 38% full. This shower is best seen in the southern tropics, but will still produce a medium shower for those north of the equator.

The Milky Way is seen from the Glacier Point Trailside in Yosemite National Park, California.

The Delta Aquariids are also best seen from the southern tropics and will peak between July 28 and 29 when the moon is 74% full.

Interestingly, another meteor shower peaks on the same night -- the Alpha Capricornids. Although this is a much weaker shower, it has been known to produce some bright fireballs during the peak. And it will be visible for those on either side of the equator.

The Perseid meteor shower, the most popular of the year, will peak between August 11 and 12 in the Northern Hemisphere when the moon is only 13% full.

Here is the meteor shower schedule for the rest of the year, according to EarthSky's meteor shower outlook

October 8: Draconids

October 21: Orionids

November 4 to 5: South Taurids

Solar and lunar eclipses

This year, there will be two eclipses of the sun and two eclipses of the moon -- and three of these will be visible for some in North America, according to The Old Farmer's Almanac

A total eclipse of the moon will occur on May 26, best visible to those in western North America and Hawaii from 4:46 a.m. ET to 9:51 a.m. ET.

An annular eclipse of the sun will happen on June 10, visible in northern and northeastern North America from 4:12 a.m. ET to 9:11 a.m. ET. The sun won't be fully blocked by the moon, so be sure to wear eclipse glasses to safely view this event.

November 19 will see a partial eclipse of the moon and skywatchers in North America and Hawaii will see it between 1 a.m. ET and 7:06 a.m. ET.

And the year ends with a total eclipse of the sun on December 4. It won't be seen in North America, but those in the Falkland Islands, the southern tip of Africa, Antarctica and southeastern Australia will be able to spot it.

Visible planets

Skywatchers will have multiple opportunities to spot the planets in our sky during certain mornings and evenings throughout 2021, according to The Farmer's Almanac planetary guide

It's possible to see most of these with the naked eye, with the exception of distant Neptune, but binoculars or a telescope will provide the best view.

Mercury will look like a bright star in the morning sky from February 28 to March 20, June 27 to July 16, and October 18 to November 1. It will shine in the night sky from January 15 to January 31, May 3 to May 24, August 31 to September 21 and November 29 to December 31.

Venus, our closest neighbor in the solar system, will appear in the eastern sky on the mornings of January 1 to 23 and in the western sky at dusk on the evenings of May 24 to December 31. It's the second brightest object in our sky after the moon.

Mars makes its reddish appearance in the morning sky between November 24 and December 31 and will be visible in the evening sky between January 1 and August 22.

Jupiter, the largest planet in our solar system, is the third brightest object in our sky. It will be on display in the morning sky between February 17 and August 19. Look for it in the evenings of January 1 to 9 and August 20 to December 31 -- but it will be at its brightest from August 8 to September 2.

Saturn's rings are only visible through a telescope, but the planet itself can still be seen with the naked eye on the mornings of February 10 to August 1 and the evenings of January 1 to 6 and August 2 to December 31. It will be at its brightest between August 1 to 4.

Binoculars or a telescope will help you spot the greenish glow of Uranus on the mornings of May 16 to November 3 and the evenings of January 1 to April 12 and November 4 to December 31 -- but at its brightest between August 28 to December 31.

And our most distant neighbor in the solar system, Neptune will be visible through a telescope on the mornings of March 27 to September 13 and the evenings of January 1 to February 23 and September 14 to December 31. It will be at its brightest between July 19 and November 8.",['Ashley Strickland'],https://news.google.com,high
"COVID-19 likely to impact the brain, San Antonio researchers find","SAN ANTONIO – The coronavirus pandemic has plagued the planet for nearly a year and now researchers at the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio are studying how COVID-19 impacts the brain.

Dementia researchers at UT Health helped pen the report, including lead author Gabriel A. de Erausquin who said “Since the flu pandemic of 1917 and 1918, many of the flulike diseases have been associated with brain disorders.”

According to de Erausquin, “those respiratory viruses included H1N1 and SARS-CoV. The SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes COVID-19, is also known to impact the brain and nervous system.”

Funding for this new research is being provided by the Alzheimer’s Association which is helping pool together data from more than 30 countries “to understand how COVID-19 increases the risk, severity, pace and progression of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s and psychiatric diseases including depression,” a release from UT Health states.

The researchers have already found that the coronavirus enters cell receptors called ACE2, the highest concentration of which can be found in the olfactory bulb of the brain which is related to people’s sense of smell.

“Olfactory cells are very susceptible to viral invasion and are particularly targeted by SARS-CoV-2, and that’s why one of the prominent symptoms of COVID-19 is loss of smell,” said Sudha Seshadri, another researcher at UT Health.

The olfactory bulb connects with the brain’s hippocampus, which is responsible for short-term memory primarily.

“The trail of the virus, when it invades the brain, leads almost straight to the hippocampus,” de Erausquin said. “That is believed to be one of the sources of the cognitive impairment observed in COVID-19 patients. We suspect it may also be part of the reason why there will be an accelerated cognitive decline over time in susceptible individuals.”

Researchers have also discovered that SARS-CoV-2 can be found in the brain after patients have died and that abnormal brain imaging, sometimes characterized by lesions in different areas of the brain, “has emerged as a major feature of COVID-19 from all parts of the world.”

UT Health officials said researchers will continue to collect information over the next 2-3 years and are expecting initial results in early 2022. The World Health Organization is also helping guide the study.

"Top ranked diets of 2021: What works, what doesn’t, according to experts","The New Year often serves as a wake-up call for people wanting to healthier after spending the holiday months indulging in some of their favorite foods.

With that in mind, the U.S. News and World Report had an expert panel review more than 40 eating plans and then ranked the 20 best diets of 2021 to help people “lose weight and improve your overall health.” In the top spot was the Mediterranean diet, following by the DASH and Flexitarian diets in a tie for spot No. 2, followed by the WW, keto and Dukan diets.

Yahoo Life spoke with nutrition experts about the top-ranked eating plans — with some expressing surprise over how some diets made the cut.

The heart-healthy Mediterranean diet, high in vegetables, fruits, whole grains, beans, nuts, seeds, and olive oil, was rated the No. 1 diet of 2021. (Photo: Getty Images)

Mediterranean diet

This heart-healthy, plant-focused eating plan was ranked as the best overall diet. The Mediterranean diet is high in vegetables, fruits, whole grains, beans, nuts and seeds, and olive oil, according to the Mayo Clinic. Fish, poultry, eggs, and beans are eaten on a weekly basis along with a moderate amount of dairy products, while red meat is limited. Unlike many diets, red wine is also allowed, in moderation.

The eating plan is designed to help stabilize blood sugar, improve cholesterol and triglyceride levels, and reduce heart disease risk, according to MedlinePlus, but some people lose weight on the Mediterranean diet by making healthier food choices.

Leah Groppo, a clinical dietician with Stanford Health Care, is not surprised this healthy eating plan landed on top, telling Yahoo Life, that “there are decades of research around this diet.” Groppo adds: “I love the idea of eating more fruits, vegetables, whole grains, beans, nuts, and seeds because they’re high in fiber and healthy fats, and provide us energy.”

Unlike fad diets, the Mediterranean eating plan is not overly restrictive, which makes it easier to follow and more sustainable. “No foods are off limits,” Keri Gans, registered dietician and author of The Small Change Diet, tells Yahoo Life. “It encourages a very healthy, well-balanced diet that includes plenty of healthy fats, 100 percent whole grains, nuts and seeds and plenty of fish. It includes low-fat dairy. There are no gimmicks. There are no foods that are banned. Even red meat is included, but they say eat more fish and poultry. It’s all encompassing and that’s what I love about it.”

Story continues

As Groppo puts it, “It’s not even a diet — it’s a lifestyle.”

DASH diet

This healthy eating plan tied for second place with the Flexitarian diet (below). Like the Mediterranean diet, the DASH diet — which stands for Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension — also focuses on improving heart health.

The meal plan, which is based on studies sponsored by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), includes eating a variety of vegetables, fruits and whole grains, along with fat-free or low-fat dairy products, fish, poultry, beans, nuts and vegetable oils, according to the NHLBI. Foods that are high in saturated fat, including full-fat dairy products and fatty meats, are limited on the meal plan, along with sweets and sugar-sweetened beverages.

While the DASH diet is thought of a lower-salt plan, Gans explains that you can consume up to 2,300 milligrams of sodium (about 1 teaspoon) per day, which is the same daily amount recommended by the government’s Dietary Guidelines for Americans. (Americans have an average of 3,400 milligrams of sodium per day, according to the Food and Drug Administration.)

By watching your sodium intake and eating a variety of healthy, whole foods, the DASH diet helps lower high blood pressure and improve cholesterol levels, which reduces heart disease risk, according to MedlinePlus.

Although the DASH diet is designed as a dietary approach to controlling hypertension, Gans explains that you don’t have to have high blood pressure to follow this healthy eating plan. In fact, she says that most people should be eating this way anyway. “Overall, it’s emphasizing all the foods we’ve been told to eat,” Gans says.

Flexitarian diet

The Flexitarian eating plan, which was created by dietitian Dawn Jackson Blatner, consists of following a vegetarian diet most of the time — namely, eating a diet rich in vegetables, fruits, legumes and whole grains. However, you can still have some meat-based foods on occasion, while also limiting added sugar and sweets.

Gans likes that “you don’t have to cut out the foods you love — you just need to focus on being vegetarian more,” she says. By encouraging people to eat more plant-based meals and consume less meat, Gans says they can help lower the risk for heart disease.

“This is a plant-based diet that allows you flexibility,” says Groppo, who notes that plant-based foods are often high in fiber and tend to be lower in calories, while meat tends to be higher in saturated fat. Groppo adds that eating a well-planned vegetarian diet is “overall better for our body and our environment.”

WW (formerly Weight Watchers) diet

WW’s myWW program custom, flexible weight loss plan came in fourth, after the DASH and Flexitarian diets. The program uses WW’s SmartPoints system, which assigns numbers to every food and beverage based on the number of calories, as well as how much saturated fat, sugar and protein, they contain.

According to the plan, no foods are off limits. “Any diet that includes all foods I really can’t condemn,” says Gans.

While the other healthy eating plans are free except for the cost of food, WW does have membership fees, which start at $3.22 per week and go up to $13.85 per week. Gans says that the eating plan isn’t for everyone, but it may be helpful for those who need more structure and guidance. “It’s also all about the community of WW,” says Gans. “Those who do well it’s because of the community.”

Groppo says that “people can do really well on WW” and that with its points system, they’ve basically done all the “backend” calculations for you, “so you don’t have to count calories.” Groppo adds: “It does help you lower calorie intake and have healthier options.”

However, the experts were surprised by some of the other popular eating plans that made the U.S. News and World Report’s best diets list — namely, the keto and Dukan diets.

Keto diet

The keto diet has been a popular weight-loss plan in recent years, but not every nutritionist is a fan. Gans calls it a “diet of deprivation,” adding: “Atkins, supercharged, is really what it is.”

The high-protein, very low carb diet is meant to put a person’s body into ketosis — a metabolic state in which your body goes from using glucose as its primary fuel source to breaking down stored fat instead, explains Groppo.

Groppo tells Yahoo Life that some research shows the keto diet can help with weight loss, along with lowering blood sugar in people with type 2 diabetes (talk to your healthcare provider before starting the keto or any other diet). But, Groppo says, “It’s not a sustainable diet,” adding, “The diet is very restrictive. Normally when you want to improve your health or lose weight, you want to do something that’s sustainable.”

While the protein-heavy keto diet may have some benefits, Gans says there’s a “greater body of evidence” that shows “diets high in saturated fat” — which is primarily found in animal products, such as meat — “can cause heart disease.” Gans adds, “The jury is out regarding how long one can sustain the keto diet and what other health risks may be involved. We don’t know long-term.”

Dukan diet

Created by French physician Dr. Pierre Dukan, the Dukan diet was thrust into the spotlight after Kate Middleton reportedly followed it before marrying Prince William. The weight-loss plan has four phases: Attack, Cruise, Consolidation, and Stabilization. The high-protein, low-fat, low-carb diet allows followers to eat 100 foods (68 types of protein and 32 different vegetables), as well as a small amount of oat bran. Followers get to add on more foods as they reach different phases.

“Right away, when I hear anything with ‘phases,’ that should be a red flag because that, to me, is not a lifestyle,” says Gans, who calls the eating plan “so confusing.” Groppo also questions how healthy it is to cut out entire food groups as required in the beginning of the diet. “You would probably lose weight,” Groppo says. “But is it sustainable? I don’t think so.”

Whether you’d like to reach a healthier weight or simply want to eat better, Gans says that it’s important to focus on lifestyle changes that are sustainable, while also looking at how much sleep you’re getting, how often you’re physically active, and what your stress levels are. “Let’s not just look at our food intake, but our entire self,” Gans says.

A new approach to study autoimmune diseases,"Research team determines that the ""Immune only"" focus of current research must be updated to better understand autoimmune diseases such as type 1 diabetes and multiple sclerosis

Indianapolis, Ind. - A team of researchers led by the Indiana Biosciences Research Institute Diabetes Center's Scientific Director Decio L. Eizirik, MD, PhD, has found that identifying new treatments for autoimmune diseases requires studying together the immune system AND target tissues. This study, ""Gene expression signatures of target tissues in type 1 diabetes, lupus erythematosus, multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis,"" is featured in the Jan. 6, 2021, edition of Science Advances.

""We must move away from the present ""immune-centric-only"" view of autoimmune diseases,"" explains Eizirik. ""Indeed, trying to understand these diseases focusing on the immune system only, and forgetting the target tissues, may be similar to attempting to fly a plane with only one wing.""

Autoimmune diseases, which affect up to 5 percent of the population in different regions, suffer from a case of mistaken identity. The immune system is supposed to protect us from infectious diseases or tumors. Yet, during autoimmune diseases the immune system mistakenly attacks and destroys components of our body, which then causes, for example, type 1 diabetes (T1D), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), multiple sclerosis (MS) or rheumatoid arthritis (RA). These four autoimmune diseases share almost half of the same genetic risks, chronic local inflammation and mechanisms leading to target tissue damage.

Despite these common features, autoimmune disorders are traditionally studied independently and with a focus on the immune system rather than on the target tissues. Knowing that there is increasing evidence that the target tissues of these diseases are not innocent bystanders of the immune system attack, but instead are active participants, Eizirik and his team hypothesized that key inflammation-induced mechanisms, potentially shared between T1D, SLE, MS and RA, may drive similar molecular signatures at the target tissue level.

""This research is significant in reaching the JDRF's mission to cure, treat and prevent T1D,"" said Frank Martin, Ph.D., JDRF director of research. ""Discovering the common pathways of tissue destruction across multiple autoimmune diseases will dramatically accelerate our path to a cure for T1D. Drugs that are effective in one autoimmune disease could be equally beneficial for another and quickly repurposed to make a big impact for people living with that disease. Characterizing the similarities and differences between multiple autoimmune diseases has the potential to transform the way we treat and cure these diseases in the future.""

To test this hypothesis, the research team obtained gene expression data from diseased tissue sampled from controls or individuals affected by T1D, SLE, MS and RA. This indicated major common gene expression changes at the target tissues of the four autoimmune diseases evaluated. One candidate gene in common between the four diseases is TYK2, a protein that regulates interferon signaling. The team showed in its research that use of TYK2 inhibitors - already in use for other autoimmune diseases - protect β-cells against immune-mediated damage. This finding reinforces the importance of studying the target tissue of autoimmune diseases, in dialogue with the immune system, to better understand the genetics and natural history of these devastating diseases and to identify novel therapies.

Mouse study finds link between gut disease and brain injury in premature infants,"Physicians have long known that necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), a potentially lethal inflammatory condition that destroys a premature infant's intestinal lining, is often connected to the development of severe brain injury in those infants who survive. However, the means by which the diseased intestine ""communicates"" its devastation to the newborn brain has remained largely unknown.

Now, working with mice, researchers at Johns Hopkins Medicine and the University of Lausanne in Switzerland have identified that missing link -- an immune system cell that they say travels from the gut to the brain and attacks cells rather than protect them as it normally does.

The team's findings are published Jan. 6, 2021, in the journal Science Translational Medicine.

Seen in as many as 12% of infants weighing less than 3.5 pounds at birth, NEC is a rapidly progressing gastrointestinal emergency in which bacteria invade the wall of the colon and cause inflammation that can ultimately destroy healthy tissue at the site. If enough cells become necrotic (die) so that a hole is created in the intestinal wall, bacteria can enter the bloodstream and cause life-threatening sepsis.

In a 2018 mouse study, researchers at Johns Hopkins Medicine and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center found that animals with NEC make a protein called toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) that binds to bacteria in the gut and precipitates the intestinal destruction. They also determined that TLR4 simultaneously activates immune cells in the brain known as microglia, leading to white matter loss, brain injury and diminished cognitive function. What wasn't clear was how the two are connected.

For this latest study, the researchers speculated that CD4+ T lymphocytes -- immune system cells also known as helper T cells -- might be the link. CD4+ T cells get their ""helper"" nickname because they help another type of immune cell called a B lymphocyte (or B cell) respond to surface proteins -- antigens -- on cells infected by foreign invaders such as bacteria or viruses. Activated by the CD4+ T cells, immature B cells become either plasma cells that produce antibodies to mark the infected cells for disposal from the body or memory cells that ""remember"" the antigen's biochemistry for a faster response to future invasions.

CD4+ T cells also send out chemical messengers that bring another type of T cell -- known as a killer T cell -- to the area so that the targeted infected cells can be removed. However, if this activity occurs in the wrong place or at the wrong time, the signals may inadvertently direct the killer T cells to attack healthy cells instead.

""We knew from comparing the brains of infants with NEC with ones from infants who died from other causes that the former had accumulations of CD4+ T cells and showed increased microglial activity,"" says study senior author David Hackam, M.D., Ph.D., surgeon-in-chief at Johns Hopkins Children's Center and professor of surgery at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. ""We suspected that these T cells came from the NEC-inflamed regions of the gut and set out to prove it by using neonatal mice as a model of what happens in human infants.""

In the first of a series of experiments, the researchers induced NEC in infant mice and then examined their brains. As expected, the tissues showed a significant increase in CD4+ T cells as well as higher levels of a protein associated with increased microglial activity. In a follow up test, the researchers showed that mice with NEC had a weakened blood-brain barrier -- the biological wall that normally prevents bacteria, viruses and other hazardous materials circulating in the bloodstream from reaching the central nervous system. This could, the researchers surmised, explain how CD4+ T cells from the gut could travel to the brain.

Next, the researchers determined that accumulating CD4+ T cells were the cause of the brain injury seen with NEC. They did this first by biologically blocking the movement of the helper T cells into the brain and then in a separate experiment, neutralizing the T cells by binding them to a specially designed antibody. In both cases, microglial activity was subdued and white matter in the brain was preserved.

To further define the role of CD4+ T cells in brain injury, the researchers harvested T cells from the brains of mice with NEC and injected them into the brains of mice bred to lack both T and B lymphocytes. Compared with control mice that did not receive any T cells, the mice that did receive the lymphocytes had higher levels of the chemical signals which attract killer T cells. The researchers also observed activation of the microglia, inflammation of the brain and loss of white matter -- all markers of brain injury.

The researchers then sought to better define how the accumulating CD4+ T cells were destroying white matter -- actually a fat called myelin that covers and protects neurons in the brain, and facilitates communication between them. To do this, they used organoids, mouse brain cells grown in the laboratory to simulate the entire brain. Brain-derived CD4+ T cells from mice with NEC were added to these laboratory ""mini-brains"" and then examined for several weeks.

Hackam and his colleagues found that a specific chemical signal from the T cells -- a cytokine (inflammatory protein) known as interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) -- increased in the organoids as the amount of myelin decreased. This activity was not seen in the organoids that received CD4+ T cells from mice without NEC.

After adding IFN-gamma alone to the organoids, the researchers saw the same increased levels of inflammation and reduction of myelin that they had seen in mice with NEC. When they added an IFN-gamma neutralizing antibody, cytokine production was significantly reduced, inflammation was curtailed and white matter was partially restored.

The researchers concluded that IFN-gamma directs the process leading to NEC-related brain injury. Their finding was confirmed when an examination of brain tissues from mice with NEC revealed higher levels of IFN-gamma than in tissues from mice without the disease.

Next, the researchers investigated whether CD4+ T cells could migrate from the gut to the brain of mice with NEC. To do this, they obtained CD4+ T cells from the intestines of infant mice with and without NEC. Both types of cells were injected into the brains of infant mice in two groups -- one set that could produce the protein Rag1 and one that could not. Rag1-deficient mice do not have mature T or B lymphocytes.

The Rag1-deficient mice that received gut-derived helper T cells from mice with NEC showed the same characteristics of brain injury seen in the previous experiments. T cells from both mice with and without NEC did not cause brain injury in mice with Rag1, nor did T cells from mice without NEC in Rag1-deficient mice. This showed that the gut-derived helper T cells from mice with NEC were the only ones that could cause brain injury.

In a second test, gut-derived T cells from mice with and without NEC were injected into the peritoneum -- the membrane lining the abdominal cavity -- of Rag1-deficient mice. Only the intestinal T cells from mice with NEC led to brain injury.

This finding was confirmed by genetically sequencing the same portions from both the brain-derived and gut-derived T lymphocytes from mice with and without NEC. The sequences of the helper T cells from mice with NEC, on average, were 25% genetically similar while the ones from mice without NEC were only 2% alike.

In a final experiment, the researchers blocked IFN-gamma alone. Doing so provided significant protection against the development of brain injury in mice with severe NEC. This suggests, the researchers say, a therapeutic approach that could benefit premature infants with the condition.

""Our research strongly suggests that helper T cells from intestines inflamed by NEC can migrate to the brain and cause damage,"" says Hackam. ""The mouse model in our study was previously shown to closely match what occurs in humans, so we believe that this is the likely mechanism by which NEC-related brain injury develops in premature infants.""

Based on these findings, Hackam says measures for preventing this type of brain injury, including therapies to block the action of INF-gamma, may be possible.

uOttawa study shows that mindfulness can help ease the pain of breast cancer survivors,"A study led by University of Ottawa researchers provides empirical evidence that mindfulness has a significant impact on the brain of women suffering from neuropathic pain related to breast cancer treatment. The researchers showed that mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) helps modulate neuropathic pain.

Their findings could make a difference in the lives of many women. In Canada, over a quarter of a million women are expected to be diagnosed with breast cancer - the most diagnosed cancer among women worldwide - in 2020. In addition to the psychological impacts of breast cancer, approximately 20 to 50 percent of survivors report experiencing chronic neuropathic pain following treatment.

We talked to senior author Dr. Andra Smith, Full Professor at the uOttawa School of Psychology, to learn more about the most recent findings published in the journal Mindfulness.

Why did you and your team decide to look at mindfulness to improve pain-related problems?

""Neuropathic pain is a very common side effect of chemotherapy and other breast cancer treatments. Pain killers do not always work and quality of life, cognitive abilities, and overall well-being can be reduced due to this pain. Due to these negative effects and the complexity of treatment for this type of pain following breast cancer treatment, it is important to provide adjunct treatment and management options.

We have heard a lot about mindfulness over the past few years, about how it helps people relax and feel better. If mindfulness, a non-pharmacological tool, can be used to help with neuropathic pain, women will feel better and might not experience such disruptive pain.

Pain is a subjective experience and mindfulness is often dismissed as a ""buzz word."" But our research provides objective, empirical evidence of a significant impact of mindfulness on the brain of these women.""

How was the research conducted?

""We investigated the impact of an 8-week mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) program on emotional reactivity among a sample of breast cancer survivors with chronic neuropathic pain. We used state-of-the-art brain imaging at The Ottawa Hospital, on their 3T MRI scanner and collected data on white matter health, brain activity during emotional pain related word processing and during resting state.

Women with neuropathic pain were imaged before and after an MBSR program, or treatment as usual. Pain, quality of life, and imaging were compared between the two groups and within the MBSR group pre- and post-MBSR.""

What did you find?

""We observed major reductions in brain activity following mindfulness-based stress reduction in regions related to pain, emotional regulation, and cognitive processing. Both pain severity and pain interference, for the MBSR group, were significantly reduced after the 8-week training.

Our results show a significant improvement in brain health as well as in pain perception.

There are many anecdotal reports of how this or that made a person ""feel better"" but the really exciting results here are that we can see that there are actual changes in the brain and the way a person can alter their response to pain.""

Why is it important?

""This research provides hope for a non-invasive method of easing the struggle of chronic neuropathic pain in women following breast cancer treatment.

Pain is something that people fear, and many people run into significant secondary problems because of their pain medication use, including drug misuse and mental health issues. Mindfulness has a neurophysiological effect that can alter one's perception of pain.

This research shows that there are adjunctive treatment options. If used properly, the information we have published can improve health outcomes for the people involved and could potentially also reduce health costs, as well as some of the related problems - particularly those related to mental health.""

Who worked on this research?

""Dr. Patricia Poulin, at The Ottawa Hospital, was the clinical principal investigator with her research team of Heather Romanow, Yaad Shergill, Emily Tennant, and Eve-Ling Khoo. This included recruitment of the women and all clinical assessments.

My lab performed the scanning component of the study, including my imaging team of Dr. Taylor Hatchard, Ola Mioduszewski and Dr. Lydia Fang.

Light-based processors boost machine-learning processing,"The exponential growth of data traffic in our digital age poses some real challenges on processing power. And with the advent of machine learning and AI in, for example, self-driving vehicles and speech recognition, the upward trend is set to continue. All this places a heavy burden on the ability of current computer processors to keep up with demand.

Now, an international team of scientists has turned to light to tackle the problem. The researchers developed a new approach and architecture that combines processing and data storage onto a single chip by using light-based, or ""photonic"" processors, which are shown to surpass conventional electronic chips by processing information much more rapidly and in parallel.

The scientists developed a hardware accelerator for so-called matrix-vector multiplications, which are the backbone of neural networks (algorithms that simulate the human brain), which themselves are used for machine-learning algorithms. Since different light wavelengths (colors) don't interfere with each other, the researchers could use multiple wavelengths of light for parallel calculations. But to do this, they used another innovative technology, developed at EPFL, a chip-based ""frequency comb"", as a light source.

""Our study is the first to apply frequency combs in the field of artificially neural networks,"" says Professor Tobias Kippenberg at EPFL, one the study's leads. Professor Kippenberg's research has pioneered the development of frequency combs. ""The frequency comb provides a variety of optical wavelengths that are processed independently of one another in the same photonic chip.""

""Light-based processors for speeding up tasks in the field of machine learning enable complex mathematical tasks to be processed at high speeds and throughputs,"" says senior co-author Wolfram Pernice at Münster University, one of the professors who led the research. ""This is much faster than conventional chips which rely on electronic data transfer, such as graphic cards or specialized hardware like TPU's (Tensor Processing Unit).""

After designing and fabricating the photonic chips, the researchers tested them on a neural network that recognizes of hand-written numbers. Inspired by biology, these networks are a concept in the field of machine learning and are used primarily in the processing of image or audio data. ""The convolution operation between input data and one or more filters - which can identify edges in an image, for example, are well suited to our matrix architecture,"" says Johannes Feldmann, now based at the University of Oxford Department of Materials. Nathan Youngblood (Oxford University) adds: ""Exploiting wavelength multiplexing permits higher data rates and computing densities, i.e. operations per area of processer, not previously attained.""

""This work is a real showcase of European collaborative research,"" says David Wright at the University of Exeter, who leads the EU project FunComp, which funded the work. ""Whilst every research group involved is world-leading in their own way, it was bringing all these parts together that made this work truly possible.""

The study is published in Nature this week, and has far-reaching applications: higher simultaneous (and energy-saving) processing of data in artificial intelligence, larger neural networks for more accurate forecasts and more precise data analysis, large amounts of clinical data for diagnoses, enhancing rapid evaluation of sensor data in self-driving vehicles, and expanding cloud computing infrastructures with more storage space, computing power, and applications software.

"US Capitol On Lockdown And Tear Gas Fired As Trump Supporters Charge The Police And Gain Access, Frantic Congress Sent Into Immediate Recess • Now The End Begins","NOW THE END BEGINS SHARE:

The U.S. Capitol locked down Wednesday with lawmakers inside as violent clashes broke out between supporters of President Donald Trump and police.

This is exactly what we’ve been telling you for months now was coming, and now it’s here. Take a look at the videos below and see how bad it really is. I will be updating this article as new information develops, but for now, the videos below tell you exactly what’s happening.

US Capitol locked down as Trump supporters clash with police

FROM AP: An announcement was played inside the Capitol as lawmakers were meeting and expected to vote to affirm Joe Biden’s victory. Due to an “external security threat,” no one could enter or exit the Capitol complex, the recording said.

Both chambers abruptly went into recess.

The skirmishes occurred outside in the very spot where president-elect Biden will be inaugurated in just two weeks.

Protesters tore down metal barricades at the bottom of the Capitol’s steps and were met by officers in riot gear. Some tried to push past the officers who held shields and officers could be seen firing pepper spray into the crowd to keep them back. Some in the crowd were shouting “traitors” as officers tried to keep them back.

A suspicious package was also reported in the area, Capitol Police said.

The skirmishes came just shortly after Trump addressed thousands of his supporters, riling up the crowd with his baseless claims of election fraud at a rally near the White House on Wednesday ahead of Congress’ vote.

“We will not let them silence your voices,” Trump told the protesters, who had lined up before sunrise to get a prime position to hear the president. READ MORE

Amid reports that U.S. Capitol Police officers have been injured as MAGA protesters storm the Capitol building, the National Guard tells Washingtonian that its troops have not been deployed to assist in the matter.

As of 3 p.m. Wednesday, National Guard press officer Nahaku McFadden says, “No national guard troops have been deployed directly to the Capitol.” But adds: “That could be changing because this is a fast moving and developing situation”

McFadden also shared a statement from the Office of the Secretary of the Army, which she says is the “decision-maker” about whether or not to deploy the National Guard: “The Office of the Secretary of the Army is in close contact with local and federal law enforcement agencies to review the potential additional support requirements.”

Addressing speculation on Twitter that the Defense Department denied a request from DC Mayor Muriel Bowser to have the Guard deployed, McFadden says: “I have not heard that anything has occurred in that manner at all. …So I’m not sure where the reports are [coming from] that it’s been denied or not.”

A second new strain of COVID spreads fear in Britain as Boris Johnson dithers,"National Review

On Saturday, eleven Republican senators led by Ted Cruz (R., Texas) announced a plan to vote “to reject the electors from disputed states” when Congress convenes to count the electoral votes and declare a winner of the presidential election, unless and until an “emergency 10-day audit is completed.” These senators want Congress to “immediately appoint an Electoral Commission, with full investigatory and fact-finding authority” based on the model of the Electoral Commission created to resolve the disputed 1876 election.To better understand why this plan is both illegal and a terrible idea, some background history is necessary. The Constitution’s Twelfth Amendment stipulates that the electors from each state must meet, vote, and record their votes in two separate lists, one for president and one for vice president. They must then “sign and certify” those lists and transmit them “sealed to the seat of the government of the United States, directed to the President of the Senate.” Once the lists make their way to Congress, the “President of the Senate shall, in the presence of the Senate and House of Representatives, open all the certificates and the votes shall then be counted.”This passive-voice phrasing crucially leaves out who does the counting. And the Twelfth Amendment is also silent on the extent to which the power to count includes the power to judge whether particular votes should count. As Justice Joseph Story observed in his 1833 Commentaries on the Constitution, “no provision is made for the discussion or decision of any questions, which may arise, as to the regularity and authenticity of the returns of the electoral votes,” and it “seems to have been taken for granted, that no question could ever arise on the subject.”Unfortunately, that assumption turned out to be overly optimistic. Controversies did arise, culminating in the disputed Hayes–Tilden election of 1876, which legislators settled by passing an emergency bill after the electors had cast their ballots but before Congress had counted them. The bill established a commission to determine the winner of each disputed state, but it did not attempt to set any long-term precedent.After decades of uncertainty and ad hoc answers good for one election only, Congress resolved to definitively settle the Twelfth Amendment’s ambiguities in 1887 with the passage of the Electoral Count Act (ECA). Avoiding the chaos and uncertainty of the 1876 election was a key goal of the bill; Representative Charles Baker expressed the common desire to “provide against a recurrence of the vexed questions that once threatened the welfare and peace of our country” and to select a president in such a way “so that the possibility of dissension and strife shall be avoided.” Representative John Eden noted the fraught history of election procedures being “decided upon the spur of the moment and amid the excitement of party contests.” Representative Hilary Herbert, putting it even more starkly, recalled that eleven years earlier “the country was on the eve of civil war because we had a disputed Presidential election” and because there was no law in place “under which the count could be made.”Congress believed that filling the gaps in the text of the Twelfth Amendment was the way to prevent such chaos in the future. During the congressional debate over the ECA, Representative Samuel Dibble remarked with consternation that it had been “a question ever since [the Twelfth Amendment] was adopted, by whom the votes shall be counted.”There was also significant disagreement and uncertainty over how much adjudicative authority the power to count entailed. To some members of Congress, the count was purely a formality. Representative Dibble described it as “the kind of ascertainment that the clerk of a court or a registering officer exercises when he reads the decree of the court, in order to record it,” which is to say, “a ministerial act, not a judicial act.” But others took a different view. Representative William Cooper argued that the power to count included the power to ascertain whether each list was “in fact the lawful vote of a State.” Representative George Adams similarly believed that legal judgment is implied in the duty to count and that Congress’s “determination that [an] alleged return is the legal return is the counting of the vote of that State within the meaning of the Constitution.”Representative Andrew Caldwell, one of the primary drafters of the ECA, proclaimed that its passage would end these debates and “settle all the questions which have arisen from time to time as to the electoral count.” The act, he said, would establish “first, that the power to count the vote is not in the President of the Senate” but instead “in the two Houses of Congress,” and, second, that the “power of the two Houses in counting the vote is something more than ministerial and perfunctory merely.” Congress would have the power “to determine what are legal votes, and who has a majority of legal votes” because the “power to judge of the legality of the votes is a necessary consequent of the power to count.”To that end, the ECA gave Congress the authority to reject an illegal electoral vote by a majority vote of both houses. But the ECA’s drafters knew how explosive and consequential that power could be if it were ever exercised, so they laid out narrow grounds for rejecting an electoral vote as illegal: Only those votes that have not been “regularly given by electors whose appointment has been lawfully certified” can be rejected.Thus, the ECA creates two specific categories of illegality: To be illegal, an electoral vote must either have been not “regularly given” or not “lawfully certified.” And at the time of the bill’s passage, neither category was understood to cover a belief that the election of an elector was flawed.The inquiry into whether an electoral vote was “regularly given” involves questions not about how the elector was chosen, but instead about the elector’s act of voting for president itself — whether it complied with the basic, facially apparent requirements of procedure. Those who drafted and passed the ECA provided a helpful litany of examples of valid reasons for Congress to reject an electoral vote as not “regularly given,” including: if the vote was not cast “by ballot as the law requires,” if the vote was not cast “upon the day appointed by law,” if an elector failed to “sign and certify” the vote, if an elector failed to cast at least one vote for “a citizen of another State,” and if the vote were for someone not constitutionally “eligible to the office” of president (such as someone not “a native-born citizen, or over thirty-five years of age”).Complementing these potential procedural deficiencies, the category of votes not “lawfully certified” encompassed attempted certifications of persons rendered ineligible to be electors, most likely by some structural constitutional provision. Examples included: if the vote was cast by an elector “ineligible to that office” (such as someone already holding another office), if a state attempted to cast a total number of electoral votes not “equal to her number of Senators and Representatives,” if a state attempted to cast electoral votes after abandoning a republican form of government, or if a territory not yet admitted as a state (or not yet readmitted as a state) attempted to cast electoral votes (a much more plausible problem for those who had lived through the gradual readmission of the seceded states after the Civil War).Although Congress contemplated the unlikely event of someone claiming to be an elector despite the legally mandated election for electors having not occurred, conspicuously absent from the debate over the ECA was any discussion of objections based on a wholesale relitigation of the conduct of an election for the electors. Both the structure and history of the ECA support the view that general concerns about the administration of an election were not viewed as falling under either category of valid objection when the law was passed.The ECA was expressly written to prevent a repeat of the interminable 1876 dispute. Rather than allowing Congress to kick the can of accountability to a commission, it requires that a decision on each objection to an electoral vote must be reached after a debate strictly limited to two hours. This structure makes sense only if objections are of a type that can be meaningfully considered and decided in two hours, i.e., if they involve facial legal problems with the electors rather than complex factual allegations of problems with their election.What does all this history tell us about the eleven Republican senators seeking to “reject the electors from disputed states” when Congress meets to count the electoral votes and declare a winner on Wednesday? Well, first and foremost, none of their disputes with the 2020 election plausibly qualify as a challenge to an electoral vote as having not been “regularly given” or “lawfully certified.” Indeed, the senators’ stated plan to object to the votes as both “not ‘regularly given’ and ‘lawfully certified’ (the statutory requisite)” without differentiation between the two demonstrates that they are not even attempting to take seriously the text of the bill as it was understood at the time of passage. To be sure, the ECA can always be altered by the passage of a new bill, which is presumably the vehicle by which these senators will demand a new electoral commission. But unless and until such an amendment to the ECA passes, the ECA is still binding. And the very fact that these senators acknowledge they would need a commission to meaningfully investigate their issues with the election shows that their challenge does not faithfully qualify as an ECA challenge.The ECA codified an important lesson learned from 1876 and earlier elections: Congress as an institution is ill-suited to the type of quick, fact-intensive, and impartial investigation necessary to competently resolve questions about the administration of an election. Those questions are better left to the courts, so the ECA, among other things, moved the counting of electoral votes back to “more than double the time the states had to determine the outcome of their elector elections.”That is what happened, successfully, in the 2020 election. Although the letter by the eleven Republican senators disingenuously notes that the Supreme Court has twice declined review of cases arising from the 2020 election, this does not mean, as the letter implies, that courts have not “heard evidence and resolved these claims of serious election fraud.” The state and federal judiciary encompasses vastly more than the Supreme Court, and cases have been heard and decided in dozens of courts across the country, as the ECA contemplates.Speaking in support of the ECA’s passage in December 1886, Representative Herbert presciently observed that the “country never will be satisfied in any political case with a temporary expedient or device under a law passed at the moment, after parties had taken sides on the question.” The 1876 commission failed to attain legitimacy, he argued, because the people “want laws passed before cases arise, and not with reference to any special case that may have arisen” already.Those senators inviting a repeat of the chaos of 1876 today would do well to consider the wisdom of Herbert and other men who lived through it.",[],https://news.yahoo.com,high
"McConnell: Trump election claims include 'sweeping conspiracy theories,' 'nation deserves a lot better'","The Conversation

Mike Pence has remained one of the only constants in the often chaotic Trump administration.Variously described as “vanilla,” “steady” and loyal to the point of being “sycophantic,” he is, in the words of one profile, an “everyman’s man with Midwest humility and approachability,” and in another, a “61-year-old, soft-spoken, deeply religious man.”But that humility and loyalty are being tested as his tenure as vice president draws to an end. “I hope Mike Pence comes through for us,” Trump told supporters at a rally on Monday, seemingly under the mistaken belief that Pence can overturn the election result as he presides over the Electoral College vote count at a joint session of Congress today. Balancing the ticketThroughout the past four years, the vice president has offered a striking contrast to the mercurial, abrasive temperament of his commander in chief. Indeed, in his acceptance speech at the 2016 Republican National Convention, Pence joked that he’d been chosen because Trump, with his “large personality,” “colorful style,” and “lots of charisma,” was “looking for some balance on the ticket.” Commentators have attributed Pence’s steadiness to his Hoosier roots and his “savvy political operator” skills. But it is his religious beliefs that perhaps inform his politics and style more than anything else; as Pence has oft repeated, he is “a Christian, conservative and Republican – in that order.” In a 2011 profile during Pence’s run for Indiana governor, noted state political columnist Brian Howey remarked, “Pence doesn’t just wear his faith on his sleeve, he wears the whole Jesus jersey.”It isn’t a characterization that Pence has shied away from. “My Christian faith is at the very heart of who I am,” Pence said during the 2016 vice presidential debate.Richard Land, former president of the Southern Baptist Convention’s Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission and current president of Southern Evangelical Seminary in Charlotte, told the Atlantic in 2018, “Mike Pence is the 24-karat-gold model of what we want in an evangelical politician. I don’t know anyone who’s more consistent in bringing his evangelical Christian worldview to public policy.” But as a scholar of U.S. religion and culture, I believe that Pence’s faith and political identities are more complex than these statements suggest. In fact, one can trace three distinct conversion experiences in his biography. Three-point conversionGrowing up in an Irish Catholic family with five siblings, working-class roots and Democratic political commitments, Pence attended Catholic school, served as an altar boy at his family’s church, idolized John F. Kennedy and was a youth coordinator for the local Democratic Party in his teens.It was as a freshman at Hanover College in 1978 that Pence experienced an evangelical conversion while attending a music festival in Kentucky billed as the “Christian Woodstock.”For some years afterward he remained active in the Catholic Church, attending Mass regularly, serving as a youth minister and seriously considering joining the priesthood. At the same time, he and his future wife Karen were part of a demographic shift of Americans who “had grown up Catholic and still loved many things about the Catholic Church, but also really loved the concept of having a very personal relationship with Christ,” as a close friend put it.By the mid-1990s he was a married father of three who identified as a “born-again, evangelical Catholic,” an unusual term that has caused some consternation among both evangelicals and Catholics.In subsequent interviews, Pence has spoken freely about how his 1978 conversion gave him a “personal relationship with Jesus Christ” that “changed everything.” But he has tended to avoid labeling his religious views when pressed, referring to himself as a “pretty ordinary Christian” who “cherishes his Catholic upbringing.” He has attended nondenominational evangelical churches with his family since at least 1995. Pence’s political conversion was more clear cut. Though he voted for Jimmy Carter in the 1980 presidential election, he quickly came to embrace Ronald Reagan’s economic and social conservatism and his populist appeal. In a 2016 speech at the Reagan Library, Pence credited Reagan with inspiring him to “leave the party of my youth and become a Republican like he did.” “His broad-shouldered leadership changed my life,” he said. Pence has frequently compared Trump to Reagan, arguing that they have the same “broad shoulders.”Pence ran unsuccessfully for Congress in 1988 and 1990, and the second bruising loss precipitated a third conversion, this time in political style. In a 1991 published essay titled “Confessions of a Negative Campaigner,” he described himself as a sinner and wrote of his “conversion” to the belief that “negative campaigning is wrong.” Between 1992 and 1999, Pence honed his blend of family values and fiscal conservatism in an eponymous conservative talk show.The show’s popularity provided a springboard to a successful run for Congress in 2000. During his six terms in the House, Pence acquired a reputation for “unalloyed traditional conservatism” and principled opposition to Republican Party leadership on issues like No Child Left Behind and Medicare prescription drug expansion. Religious actsIn addition to his “unsullied” reputation as a “culture warrior,” he also attracted attention for following the “Billy Graham Rule” of avoiding meeting with women alone and avoiding events where alcohol was served when his wife was not present. During the 2016 vice presidential debate, Pence said that his entire career in public service stems from a commitment to “live out” his religious beliefs, “however imperfectly.”One of those beliefs is his opposition to abortion, grounded in his reading of particular biblical passages. As a congressman in 2007, he was the first to sponsor legislation defunding Planned Parenthood, and did so repeatedly until the first defunding bill passed in 2011. “I long for the day when Roe v. Wade is sent to the ash heap of history,” he said at the time.In 2016, over the objections of many Republican state representatives, he signed the most restrictive set of anti-abortion measures in the country into law, making him a conservative hero. Among other things, the bill prevented women from terminating pregnancies for reasons including fetal disability such as Down syndrome. Although opponents succeeded in getting the bill overturned in the courts, Indiana is still seen as one of the most anti-abortion states in America.As vice president, Pence also cast the tie-breaking Senate vote to allow states to withhold federal family planning funds from Planned Parenthood in 2017.Pence has also been an outspoken opponent of LGBTQ rights. He opposed the inclusion of sexual orientation in hate crimes legislation and the end of the military’s “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” policy. He likewise supported both state and federal constitutional amendments to ban same-sex marriage, and expressed disappointment at the 2015 Obergefell decision, which required all states to recognize such unions.At the same time he has been a strong supporter of “religious freedom,” particularly for Christians.In March 2015, as Indiana governor, he signed the state’s Religious Freedom Restoration Act “to ensure that religious liberty is fully protected.” The act ignited a firestorm of nationwide controversy: Critics alleged that it would allow for individuals and businesses to legally discriminate against members of the LGBTQ community. Under pressure from LGBTQ activists, liberals, business owners and moderate Republicans, Pence signed an amendment a week later stipulating that it did not authorize discrimination. Staked reputationPence’s religious and political biography mirrors key political and religious shifts over the past 40 years, from the rise of the religious right and its growing influence in the Republican Party to the conservative coalition of evangelicals and Catholics across denominational lines, to the legacy of the “outsider” celebrity president.These threads converge in Mike Pence, whose “24-karat,” “unalloyed” conservative credentials were instrumental in rallying evangelical voters behind Trump in the 2016 election and who has staked his political future on continuing to defend him.This article is republished from The Conversation, a nonprofit news site dedicated to sharing ideas from academic experts.

"The Latest: 1,100 DC National Guard members being mobilized","WASHINGTON (AP) — The Latest on Congress’ tally of the Electoral College vote won by Joe Biden (all times local):

4 p.m.

The Pentagon says about 1,100 D.C. National Guard members are being mobilized to help support law enforcement as violent supporters of President Donald Trump breached the U.S. Capitol.

Pentagon spokesperson Jonathan Hoffman said Wednesday afternoon that defense leaders have been in contact with the city and congressional leadership.

A defense official said all 1,100 of the D.C. Guard were being activated and sent to the city’s armory. The Guard forces will be used at checkpoints and for other similar duties and could also help in the enforcement of the 6 p.m. curfew being implemented tonight in the city.

The officials said the D.C. request for National Guard was not rejected earlier in the day. Instead, according to officials, the Guard members have a very specific mission that does not include putting military in a law enforcement role at the Capitol. As a result, the Guard must be used to backfill law enforcement outside the Capitol complex, freeing up more law enforcement to respond to the Capitol.

Hoffman said the law enforcement response to the violence will be led by the Justice Department.

HERE'S WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT CONGRESS' TALLY OF THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE VOTE

Angry supporters of President Donald Trump stormed the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday in a chaotic protest aimed at thwarting a peaceful transfer of power, forcing lawmakers to be rushed from the building and interrupting challenges to Joe Biden’s Electoral College victory. Trump issued a restrained call for peace but did not call on his supporters to leave.

HERE'S WHAT ELSE IS GOING ON:

3:55 p.m.

The top Democrats in Congress are demanding that President Donald Trump order his supporters to leave the Capitol following a chaotic protest aimed at blocking a peaceful transfer of power.

Story continues

Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi issued a joint statement on Wednesday after violent protesters stormed the Capitol. They said, “We are calling on President Trump to demand that all protestors leave the U.S. Capitol and Capitol Grounds immediately.”

Trump earlier encouraged his supporters occupying the U.S. Capitol to “remain peaceful,” but he did not call for them to disperse. He held a rally earlier Wednesday in which he repeated his false claims that President-elect Joe Biden had won the election through voter fraud.

He urged his supporters to march to the Capitol, telling them to “get rid of the weak Congress people” and saying, “get the weak ones get out; this is the time for strength.”

3:50 p.m.

The White House says National Guard troops along with other federal protective services are en route to the Capitol to help end an violent occupation by President Donald Trump’s supporters who are seeking to prevent the certification of the 2020 presidential election.

Press secretary Kayleigh McEnany tweeted that “At President @realDonaldTrump’s direction, the National Guard is on the way along with other federal protective services.”

She added, “We reiterate President Trump’s call against violence and to remain peaceful.”

Republican lawmakers have publicly called for Trump to more vocally condemn the violence and to call to an end to the occupation, which halted a joint session of Congress where lawmakers were beginning to count electoral votes.

Trump lost the November election to Democrat Joe Biden. He has refused to concede and has worked over the last two months to convince his supporters that widespread voter fraud prevented his own victory.

Republican lawmakers are increasingly calling on President Donald Trump to act to deescalate the violent protests at the U.S. Capitol by his supporters angry about his election loss.

House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said he spoke with the president earlier Wednesday and told him to make a statement to “make sure that we can calm individuals down.”

Florida Republican Sen. Marco Rubio tweeted that “it is crucial you help restore order by sending resources to assist the police and ask those doing this to stand down.”

Republican Rep. Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey told The Associated Press that while he sympathizes with the protesters’ position, they shouldn’t get violent, and it would be “nice” if Trump called on them to “protest in a peaceful way in an appropriate spot, where you belong, where you should be.”

Many Republicans had backed Trump’s false claims of widespread voter fraud to explain away his defeat to President-elect Joe Biden.

Republican U.S. Rep. Mike Gallagher, of Wisconsin, posted a video message urging Trump to “call it off.”

“This is Banana Republic crap that we’re watching right now,” said Gallagher, who had spoken out against objections from fellow Republicans to certifying President-elect Joe Biden’s Electoral College vote.

Supporters of President Donald Trump got into a angry shouting match with other passengers on a Washington-bound American Airlines plane after they projected a “Trump 2020” logo on the cabin ceiling and walls.

The Trump supporters said a passenger threatened to kill them, and there was yelling back and forth. A flight attendant intervened, telling one passenger in the aisle to sit down.

The incident occurred on Tuesday night after American’s flight 1291 from Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport landed at Dulles International Airport outside Washington, D.C., and was taxiing to the gate.

The scene was posted on Twitter by Maranie Staab, a Portland, Oregon-based independent journalist who says on her website that she focuses on human rights and social-justice issues.

“Our team is reviewing this incident,” said American Airlines spokesman Curtis Blessing. “We applaud our outstanding crewmembers for their professionalism in de-escalating a tense onboard situation and getting our customers to their destination safely.”

American said law enforcement was not called, and that passengers deplaned and dispersed without further incident.

President Donald Trump is encouraging supporters occupying the U.S. Capitol to “remain peaceful,” but he is not calling for them to disperse.

As he faced growing pressure from allies to condemn the violence Wednesday afternoon, Trump tweeted, “No violence!” adding: “Remember, WE are the Party of Law & Order – respect the Law and our great men and women in Blue.”

But Trump did not ask supporters to vacate the area as the unrest continued.

Trump had appeared earlier at a rally and had urged his supporters to march to the Capitol — at one point even suggesting he would join them. He is upset that he lost the presidential election to Democrat Joe Biden and has falsely claimed voter fraud to explain it away.

He also urged his supporters to “get rid of the weak Congress people” — presumably through primary challenges — saying, “get the weak ones get out; this is the time for strength.”

A Defense Department official says Washington, D.C., has requested an additional 200 National Guard members as supporters of President Donald Trump violently clash with law enforcement at the Capitol.

That request is currently under review at the Pentagon to determine how the Guard can respond to support law enforcement.

According to officials, the Guard members have a very specific mission that does not include putting military at the Capitol. Instead, the Guard must be used to backfill law enforcement outside the Capitol complex, freeing up more law enforcement to respond to the Capitol.

Officials said the request for more National Guard has not been rejected.

Trump had urged his supporters to come to Washington to protest Congress’ formal approval of President-elect Joe Biden’s win. Several Republican lawmakers backed his calls, despite there being no evidence of fraud or wrongdoing in the election.

She says, “you are the only one they will listen to. For our country!”

Dozens of people have breached security perimeters at the Capitol, forcing the lockdown of the building and halting the vote to certify Joe Biden’s presidential victory.

Trump has so far offered a single tweet asking his supporters to “Please support our Capitol Police and Law Enforcement. They are truly on the side of our Country. Stay peaceful!”

His former chief of staff Mick Mulvaney tweeted: “The President’s tweet is not enough. He can stop this now and needs to do exactly that. Tell these folks to go home.”

His lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, also addressed Trump supporters in a tweet, calling them the “patriots challenging the fraudulent election” and telling them that ”POTUS wants you to EXPRESS YOUR OPINION PEACEFULLY.”

"Democrat Raphael Warnock projected winner in 1st Georgia Senate race, unseating Kelly Loeffler","National Review

On Tuesday, authorities in Wisconsin announced they would not be prosecuting Rusten Sheskey, the officer who shot and paralyzed Jacob Blake in August of last year — an incident that set off protests and riots in Kenosha, a city near the Illinois border. To justify this decision, they released two reports, one from the Kenosha County District Attorney’s Office and another from Noble Wray, a retired police chief and Obama-administration police reformer who’d been asked to render an independent assessment.Some important details of the shooting remain unclear, largely because Kenosha police did not have body cameras at the time. The incident was captured only on bystanders’ cell phones, videos from which do not show the whole situation. But when it comes to the question of a criminal prosecution, the documents are highly compelling: There is no way to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Sheskey fired without justification. If anything, the evidence tips in the opposite direction.Officer Sheskey and two other cops showed up in response to a call from Laquisha Booker, the mother of Blake’s kids. She said that Blake had taken the keys to her rental vehicle, and that he’d borrowed vehicles from her and crashed them in the past. She added that Blake was “not supposed to be here,” but that she’d let him visit for his son’s birthday. Police dispatchers told the officers that Blake had a felony arrest warrant for domestic-violence offenses and sexual assault, meaning they’d have to arrest him if they found him, under Kenosha Police Department policy.When they arrived, according to the officers and another witness, Booker said that Blake was trying to take her car and her kids — and Blake was seen putting a child in a gray SUV. Sheskey has said he wasn’t sure if the child was Blake’s or not. In truth, there were three kids in the SUV, all Blake’s.The cops tried to arrest Blake. He resisted. Two different officers shot him with Tasers, but he ripped out the probes. And to make matters worse, Blake produced a knife. Despite some claims in the media that Blake was “unarmed,” he admitted having the knife himself, there’s video of the officers telling him to drop it, and the weapon was found open in the SUV after the incident. According to the DA office’s report, Blake also resisted arrest with a knife in a 2010 incident.And then came a fateful series of decisions. As seen in the widely disseminated cell-phone video, Blake walked around the SUV and opened the door. Sheskey followed and grabbed Blake’s shirt, then fired seven times. He says he stopped shooting when Blake dropped the knife, consistent with his training to shoot until the threat stops.Were the shots justified? The key question is whether Sheskey reasonably believed lethal force was necessary to stop an imminent threat of “death or great bodily harm,” whether to him or to someone else.Sheskey, another officer, and some witnesses say that Blake twisted his body toward Sheskey before the shots rang out, which would have moved the knife toward the officer. Per the district attorney’s office, “Officer Sheskey stated that for the first time Jacob Blake showed intent to harm [as opposed to just resisting arrest] by driving the knife towards Officer Sheskey's torso.” Such an action would clearly justify deadly force.However, this gesture is not obvious in the video, at least not to me. (You can see the recording on YouTube, and move frame-by-frame using the “<” and “>” buttons on your keyboard.) That said, I wouldn’t say the video disproves these claims, either — the more important question in court, where the burden is on the prosecution — because the SUV’s door and the cops’ bodies obscure some of Blake’s movements.And at any rate, as Noble Wray’s report adds, whether> Blake drove the knife forward or not, a reasonable officer could view himself as being in imminent danger. P.O. Sheskey was literally holding on to Blake's shirt, and Blake had a knife in his hand, actively resisting, attempting to get into the vehicle. This circumstance is only compounded with the kids being in the vehicle.Of course, it was Sheskey’s own decision to grab Blake’s shirt, and there are various ways we might second-guess the officers’ actions even if we don’t prosecute them. But when it comes to those crucial final moments, the truth is that Blake put them in an impossible situation. They could have kept a safe distance from the guy with a sexual-assault warrant armed with a knife, but that would have meant letting that guy get into a vehicle they knew contained at least one child — an option that could lead to a high-speed chase or a hostage situation, both possibilities that Sheskey says he feared at the time. On the other hand, once Sheskey got close to a knife-wielding suspect, the chance he’d need to use deadly force shot way up, because knives are incredibly deadly at that range and there isn’t much time to ascertain and react to a suspect’s movements.Or, as Wray put it:> Officer Sheskey had determined that it was dangerous for the public and the child in the car to let Blake go. P.O. Sheskey felt he could not retreat once he made the decision that harm could come to the kids or to the public. I found Officer Sheskey's analysis was reasonable based on the limited information he had at the time. Officer Sheskey did not know the relationship between Blake and the child. I am not sure if it makes much difference. The U.S. Department of Justice reports in 2010 that 200,000 kids are abducted mostly by a family friend or parent. Blake's severe resistance to being taken into custody would lead a reasonable officer to believe that he would engage in a high-speed pursuit.I have no idea what actually would have happened if Sheskey hadn’t fired. I’m glad I didn’t have to make that decision myself. And I’m glad prosecutors aren’t dragging this situation out by pursuing a case they could never win.",[],https://news.yahoo.com,high
National security law: Hong Kong rounds up 53 pro-democracy activists,"Lester Shum was first barred from running for office, then arrested

More than 50 of Hong Kong's most prominent pro-democracy activists and politicians have been arrested in the biggest crackdown since China imposed a draconian security law last year.

About 1,000 police took part in morning raids on 72 premises across the city.

Those held helped run an unofficial ""primary"" to pick opposition candidates ahead of postponed 2020 elections.

They are accused of trying to ""overthrow"" the government. Activists say the new law aims to quash dissent.

China's government imposed the legislation on the semi-autonomous territory in June, saying it was necessary to curb months of sometimes violent pro-democracy protests.

Beijing defended Wednesday's arrests, with Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying saying they were needed to stop ""external forces and individuals [colluding] to undermine China's stability and security"".

But the crackdown appeared to confirm the fears of many who warned about the reach of the law, with Amnesty International saying the arrests are ""the starkest demonstration yet of how the national security law has been weaponised to punish anyone who dares to challenge the establishment"".

Who was detained?

Dozens have been arrested under the security law since it was enacted in June, but never have so many been rounded up at the same time as on Wednesday, which marked a major escalation in the crackdown and sent a chill through pro-democracy figures.

Police fanned out around the city and in early morning raids detained 53 people who represent a who's who of democratic forces in the former British colony, young and old. They include:

long-established opposition figures James To, Lam Cheuk-ting, Claudio Mo and Benny Tai, one of the initiators of the primaries

young pro-democracy campaigners Lester Shum, Gwyneth Ho, Tiffany Yuen and Jeffrey Andrews

Human rights lawyer John Clancey, a US citizen

two academics behind the primaries strategy

13 candidates from the primaries

Police also searched the home of already detained activist Joshua Wong, as well as three news outlets.

Story continues

Apple Daily and Stand News, which had co-organised election forums for the primaries candidates, and In-Media, which ran ads around the primaries, were ordered to hand over information.

Mr Clancy, a veteran legal activist and long-time resident of Hong Kong, is chairman of the Asian Human Rights Commission and the first US citizen held under the new law. He was detained when police searched the offices of law firm Ho Tse Wai & Partners where he works.

Benny Tai was one of the architects of the primaries

Hours after the dawn arrests John Lee, Hong Kong's security secretary, confirmed a group of people had been arrested as part of an operation targeting those suspected of ""overthrowing"" the city's government.

The government will not tolerate ""subversive"" acts, he said, speaking at the city's Legislative Council.

If charged under the new national security law, the detainees could face life in prison.

The BBC's Danny Vincent in Hong Kong says the legislation has spread what activists call ""white terror"" across the city. It has all but silenced the street protest movement and led to a growing number of activists fleeing the territory.

When authorities introduced the law, they claimed it would target only a small number of activists, but the wide-ranging nature of Wednesday's operation has led many to fear the authorities are now trying to eliminate the entire opposition camp, he says.

What were the primaries?

In July last year, an alliance of opposition parties ran independently organised primaries to see which of their candidates had the best chances in September's election for the Legislative Council (LegCo), Hong Kong's parliament.

More than 600,000 people voted in the primaries. The election was later postponed, with officials citing concerns over the coronavirus pandemic as the reason for the delay.

The opposition groups had hoped that winning more seats would give them enough power to block government proposals and increase pressure for democratic reforms.

Hong Kong's leader Carrie Lam had warned at the time the primaries could amount to subversion if the candidates intended to obstruct government policies through their election.

In July, Joshua Wong (on right in poster) and Lester Shum (on left) had still hoped to run for LegCo

Several of the opposition figures planning to stand in the LegCo election were later disqualified from running, including Joshua Wong, Lester Shum and Gwyneth Ho, a former journalist who rose to prominence covering the 2019 protests.

Most of the opposition lawmakers in the current LegCo resigned in November in protest at four of them being dismissed from parliament.

What's been the reaction?

The crackdown has stunned people in Hong Kong.

""Seeing the news today I feel completely shocked. I feel very disappointed. It seems that such major things are happening in Hong Kong and there's nothing we can do about it.

""I feel very unhappy and it seems that even during the epidemic the government can still do so many things to terrorise people,"" Mannie Ng, a Hong Kong resident, told Reuters news agency.

The arrests have been widely condemned internationally.

Antony Blinken, President-elect Joe Biden's pick as next US Secretary of State, said they were an ""assault on those bravely advocating for universal rights"".

""The Biden-Harris administration will stand with the people of Hong Kong and against Beijing's crackdown on democracy.""

Antony Blinken said Washington will stand with Hong Kong

UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said the arrests were a ""grievous attack"" on rights applied under the joint declaration signed with Britain when the territory was handed over in 1997.

He said it demonstrated the national security law was ""being used to crush dissent and opposing political views"".

Chris Patten, the territory's last British governor, said: ""The Chinese Communist Party has further turned the screw in Hong Kong. Liberal democracies around the world must continue to speak out against the brutal destruction of a free society.""

Maya Wang, China specialist at Human Rights Watch, said China was now ""removing the remaining veneer of democracy in the city"".

""Beijing once again has failed to learn from its mistakes in Hong Kong: that repression generates resistance, and that millions of Hong Kong people will persist in their struggle for their right to vote and run for office in a democratically elected government,"" she said.

Nathan Law, a prominent Hong Kong activist who fled the territory in July last year, said the widespread arrests had taken ""the suppression of political freedom and freedom of speech"" to ""another level"".

""Anyone who is still defending the National Security Law and making peace is the enemy of Hong Kong people.""

Street protests a 'distant memory'

By Robin Brant, BBC News, Shanghai

Beijing sees ""vicious plans"" to topple Hong Kong's semi-autonomous government. Supporters of the dozens arrested see another crude crackdown on what's left of the territory's nascent democracy.

Despite co-ordinated international criticism, with some targeted retaliation, led by the US and the UK, the authorities have enthusiastically embraced their powers under the new national security law passed last year.

How these latest arrests come under that jurisdiction is not yet clear. But it's worth remembering this law is ambiguous and sweeping in its definition, targeting anyone, anywhere in the world.

The street protests are now a distant memory. Some prominent figures have fled to friendly countries, almost certainly never to return.

What is Hong Kong's security law?

The security law punishes what China broadly defines as secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces with up to life in jail.

It has been widely criticised by rights groups and Western nations as effectively curtailing dissent.

A former British colony, Hong Kong was handed back to China in 1997. It retained more civil and political freedoms than the mainland has.

Activists say that in recent years, these freedoms have been eroded. Pro-democracy protests have often led to violent clashes with police.

Pro-democracy protests have rocked Hong Kong for years

The Chinese government has defended the law, saying it will help return stability to the territory, which has been shaken by pro-democracy protests, and bring it more into line with the Chinese mainland.

After the law was introduced, a number of pro-democracy groups disbanded out of fears for their safety and several high profile court cases under the security law have started.

Media tycoon Jimmy Lai has been charged under it as well as several activists who tried to flee the territory by boat last August.",[],https://news.yahoo.com,high
"Trump supporters storm US Capitol, lawmakers evacuated","WASHINGTON (AP) — Angry supporters of President Donald Trump stormed the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday in a chaotic protest aimed at thwarting a peaceful transfer of power, forcing lawmakers to be rushed from the building and interrupting challenges to Joe Biden’s Electoral College victory.

Trump issued a restrained call for peace well after the melee was underway but did not urge supporters to disperse. Earlier he had egged them on to march to Capitol Hill.

Wednesday's ordinarily mundane procedure of Congress certifying a new president was always going to be extraordinary, with Republican supporters of Trump vowing to protest results of an election that they have baselessly insisted was reversed by fraud. But even the unusual deliberations, which included the Republican vice president and Senate majority leader defying Trump's demands, were quickly overtaken.

In a raucous, out-of-control scene, protesters fought past police and breached the building, shouting and waving Trump and American flags as they marched through the halls. One person was reported shot at the Capitol, according to a person familiar with the situation. That person's condition was unknown.

The protesters abruptly interrupted the congressional proceedings in an eerie scene that featured official warnings directing people to duck under their seats for cover and put on gas masks after tear gas was used in the Capitol Rotunda.

With the crowds showing no signs of abating, Trump tweeted, “Please support our Capitol Police and Law Enforcement. They are truly on the side of our Country. Stay peaceful!” Earlier, at his rally, he had urged supporters to march to the Capitol.

Senators were being evacuated. Some House lawmakers tweeted they were sheltering in place in their offices.

Demonstrators fought with Capitol Police and then forced their way into the building, not long after a huge rally near the White House during which Trump egged them on to march to Capitol Hill.

Story continues

Lawmakers had convened for an extraordinary joint session to confirm the Electoral College results.

Though fellow Republicans were behind the challenge to Biden’s 306-232 Electoral College victory, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell sought to lower tensions and argued against it. He warned the country “cannot keep drifting apart into two separate tribes” with “separate facts.”

McConnell declared, “The voters, the courts and the states all have spoken.""

But other Republicans, including House GOP leaders among Trump's allies were acting out the pleas of supporters at his huge Wednesday rally up Pennsylvania Avenue outside the White House to “fight for Trump.”

“We have to fix this,” said Rep. Steve Scalise of Louisiana, the GOP whip.

The last-gasp effort is all but certain to fail, defeated by bipartisan majorities in Congress prepared to accept the November results. Biden i s to be inaugurated Jan. 20.

Still, Trump vowed to he would “never concede” and urged the massive crowd to march to the Capitol where hundreds had already gathered under tight security.

“We will never give up,” Trump told his noontime rally.

Vice President Mike Pence was closely watched as he stepped onto the dais to preside over the joint session in the House chamber.

Pence has a largely ceremonial role, opening the sealed envelopes from the states after they are carried in mahogany boxes used for the occasion, and reading the results aloud. But he was under growing pressure from Trump to overturn the will of the voters and tip the results in the president’s favor, despite having no legal power to affect the outcome.

“Do it Mike, this is a time for extreme courage!” Trump tweeted Wednesday.

But Pence, in a statement shortly before presiding, defied Trump, saying he could not claim “unilateral authority"" to reject the electoral votes that make Biden president.

Despite Trump’s repeated claims of voter fraud, election officials and his own former attorney general have said there were no problems on a scale that would change the outcome. All the states have certified their results as fair and accurate, by Republican and Democratic officials alike.

Arizona was the first of several states facing objections from the Republicans as Congress took an alphabetical reading of the election results. Then the chaos erupted.

2 Louisville police officers involved in Breonna Taylor's death have been fired,"National Review

On Tuesday, authorities in Wisconsin announced they would not be prosecuting Rusten Sheskey, the officer who shot and paralyzed Jacob Blake in August of last year — an incident that set off protests and riots in Kenosha, a city near the Illinois border. To justify this decision, they released two reports, one from the Kenosha County District Attorney’s Office and another from Noble Wray, a retired police chief and Obama-administration police reformer who’d been asked to render an independent assessment.Some important details of the shooting remain unclear, largely because Kenosha police did not have body cameras at the time. The incident was captured only on bystanders’ cell phones, videos from which do not show the whole situation. But when it comes to the question of a criminal prosecution, the documents are highly compelling: There is no way to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Sheskey fired without justification. If anything, the evidence tips in the opposite direction.Officer Sheskey and two other cops showed up in response to a call from Laquisha Booker, the mother of Blake’s kids. She said that Blake had taken the keys to her rental vehicle, and that he’d borrowed vehicles from her and crashed them in the past. She added that Blake was “not supposed to be here,” but that she’d let him visit for his son’s birthday. Police dispatchers told the officers that Blake had a felony arrest warrant for domestic-violence offenses and sexual assault, meaning they’d have to arrest him if they found him, under Kenosha Police Department policy.When they arrived, according to the officers and another witness, Booker said that Blake was trying to take her car and her kids — and Blake was seen putting a child in a gray SUV. Sheskey has said he wasn’t sure if the child was Blake’s or not. In truth, there were three kids in the SUV, all Blake’s.The cops tried to arrest Blake. He resisted. Two different officers shot him with Tasers, but he ripped out the probes. And to make matters worse, Blake produced a knife. Despite some claims in the media that Blake was “unarmed,” he admitted having the knife himself, there’s video of the officers telling him to drop it, and the weapon was found open in the SUV after the incident. According to the DA office’s report, Blake also resisted arrest with a knife in a 2010 incident.And then came a fateful series of decisions. As seen in the widely disseminated cell-phone video, Blake walked around the SUV and opened the door. Sheskey followed and grabbed Blake’s shirt, then fired seven times. He says he stopped shooting when Blake dropped the knife, consistent with his training to shoot until the threat stops.Were the shots justified? The key question is whether Sheskey reasonably believed lethal force was necessary to stop an imminent threat of “death or great bodily harm,” whether to him or to someone else.Sheskey, another officer, and some witnesses say that Blake twisted his body toward Sheskey before the shots rang out, which would have moved the knife toward the officer. Per the district attorney’s office, “Officer Sheskey stated that for the first time Jacob Blake showed intent to harm [as opposed to just resisting arrest] by driving the knife towards Officer Sheskey's torso.” Such an action would clearly justify deadly force.However, this gesture is not obvious in the video, at least not to me. (You can see the recording on YouTube, and move frame-by-frame using the “<” and “>” buttons on your keyboard.) That said, I wouldn’t say the video disproves these claims, either — the more important question in court, where the burden is on the prosecution — because the SUV’s door and the cops’ bodies obscure some of Blake’s movements.And at any rate, as Noble Wray’s report adds, whether> Blake drove the knife forward or not, a reasonable officer could view himself as being in imminent danger. P.O. Sheskey was literally holding on to Blake's shirt, and Blake had a knife in his hand, actively resisting, attempting to get into the vehicle. This circumstance is only compounded with the kids being in the vehicle.Of course, it was Sheskey’s own decision to grab Blake’s shirt, and there are various ways we might second-guess the officers’ actions even if we don’t prosecute them. But when it comes to those crucial final moments, the truth is that Blake put them in an impossible situation. They could have kept a safe distance from the guy with a sexual-assault warrant armed with a knife, but that would have meant letting that guy get into a vehicle they knew contained at least one child — an option that could lead to a high-speed chase or a hostage situation, both possibilities that Sheskey says he feared at the time.

Mike Pence has remained one of the only constants in the often chaotic Trump administration.Variously described as “vanilla,” “steady” and loyal to the point of being “sycophantic,” he is, in the words of one profile, an “everyman’s man with Midwest humility and approachability,” and in another, a “61-year-old, soft-spoken, deeply religious man.”But that humility and loyalty are being tested as his tenure as vice president draws to an end. “I hope Mike Pence comes through for us,” Trump told supporters at a rally on Monday, seemingly under the mistaken belief that Pence can overturn the election result as he presides over the Electoral College vote count at a joint session of Congress today. Balancing the ticketThroughout the past four years, the vice president has offered a striking contrast to the mercurial, abrasive temperament of his commander in chief. Indeed, in his acceptance speech at the 2016 Republican National Convention, Pence joked that he’d been chosen because Trump, with his “large personality,” “colorful style,” and “lots of charisma,” was “looking for some balance on the ticket.” Commentators have attributed Pence’s steadiness to his Hoosier roots and his “savvy political operator” skills. But it is his religious beliefs that perhaps inform his politics and style more than anything else; as Pence has oft repeated, he is “a Christian, conservative and Republican – in that order.” In a 2011 profile during Pence’s run for Indiana governor, noted state political columnist Brian Howey remarked, “Pence doesn’t just wear his faith on his sleeve, he wears the whole Jesus jersey.”It isn’t a characterization that Pence has shied away from. “My Christian faith is at the very heart of who I am,” Pence said during the 2016 vice presidential debate.Richard Land, former president of the Southern Baptist Convention’s Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission and current president of Southern Evangelical Seminary in Charlotte, told the Atlantic in 2018, “Mike Pence is the 24-karat-gold model of what we want in an evangelical politician. I don’t know anyone who’s more consistent in bringing his evangelical Christian worldview to public policy.” But as a scholar of U.S. religion and culture, I believe that Pence’s faith and political identities are more complex than these statements suggest. In fact, one can trace three distinct conversion experiences in his biography. Three-point conversionGrowing up in an Irish Catholic family with five siblings, working-class roots and Democratic political commitments, Pence attended Catholic school, served as an altar boy at his family’s church, idolized John F. Kennedy and was a youth coordinator for the local Democratic Party in his teens.It was as a freshman at Hanover College in 1978 that Pence experienced an evangelical conversion while attending a music festival in Kentucky billed as the “Christian Woodstock.”For some years afterward he remained active in the Catholic Church, attending Mass regularly, serving as a youth minister and seriously considering joining the priesthood. At the same time, he and his future wife Karen were part of a demographic shift of Americans who “had grown up Catholic and still loved many things about the Catholic Church, but also really loved the concept of having a very personal relationship with Christ,” as a close friend put it.By the mid-1990s he was a married father of three who identified as a “born-again, evangelical Catholic,” an unusual term that has caused some consternation among both evangelicals and Catholics.In subsequent interviews, Pence has spoken freely about how his 1978 conversion gave him a “personal relationship with Jesus Christ” that “changed everything.” But he has tended to avoid labeling his religious views when pressed, referring to himself as a “pretty ordinary Christian” who “cherishes his Catholic upbringing.” He has attended nondenominational evangelical churches with his family since at least 1995. Pence’s political conversion was more clear cut. Though he voted for Jimmy Carter in the 1980 presidential election, he quickly came to embrace Ronald Reagan’s economic and social conservatism and his populist appeal. In a 2016 speech at the Reagan Library, Pence credited Reagan with inspiring him to “leave the party of my youth and become a Republican like he did.” “His broad-shouldered leadership changed my life,” he said. Pence has frequently compared Trump to Reagan, arguing that they have the same “broad shoulders.”Pence ran unsuccessfully for Congress in 1988 and 1990, and the second bruising loss precipitated a third conversion, this time in political style. In a 1991 published essay titled “Confessions of a Negative Campaigner,” he described himself as a sinner and wrote of his “conversion” to the belief that “negative campaigning is wrong.” Between 1992 and 1999, Pence honed his blend of family values and fiscal conservatism in an eponymous conservative talk show.The show’s popularity provided a springboard to a successful run for Congress in 2000. During his six terms in the House, Pence acquired a reputation for “unalloyed traditional conservatism” and principled opposition to Republican Party leadership on issues like No Child Left Behind and Medicare prescription drug expansion. Religious actsIn addition to his “unsullied” reputation as a “culture warrior,” he also attracted attention for following the “Billy Graham Rule” of avoiding meeting with women alone and avoiding events where alcohol was served when his wife was not present. During the 2016 vice presidential debate, Pence said that his entire career in public service stems from a commitment to “live out” his religious beliefs, “however imperfectly.”One of those beliefs is his opposition to abortion, grounded in his reading of particular biblical passages. As a congressman in 2007, he was the first to sponsor legislation defunding Planned Parenthood, and did so repeatedly until the first defunding bill passed in 2011. “I long for the day when Roe v. Wade is sent to the ash heap of history,” he said at the time.In 2016, over the objections of many Republican state representatives, he signed the most restrictive set of anti-abortion measures in the country into law, making him a conservative hero. Among other things, the bill prevented women from terminating pregnancies for reasons including fetal disability such as Down syndrome. Although opponents succeeded in getting the bill overturned in the courts, Indiana is still seen as one of the most anti-abortion states in America.As vice president, Pence also cast the tie-breaking Senate vote to allow states to withhold federal family planning funds from Planned Parenthood in 2017.Pence has also been an outspoken opponent of LGBTQ rights. He opposed the inclusion of sexual orientation in hate crimes legislation and the end of the military’s “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” policy. He likewise supported both state and federal constitutional amendments to ban same-sex marriage, and expressed disappointment at the 2015 Obergefell decision, which required all states to recognize such unions.At the same time he has been a strong supporter of “religious freedom,” particularly for Christians.In March 2015, as Indiana governor, he signed the state’s Religious Freedom Restoration Act “to ensure that religious liberty is fully protected.” The act ignited a firestorm of nationwide controversy: Critics alleged that it would allow for individuals and businesses to legally discriminate against members of the LGBTQ community. Under pressure from LGBTQ activists, liberals, business owners and moderate Republicans, Pence signed an amendment a week later stipulating that it did not authorize discrimination. Staked reputationPence’s religious and political biography mirrors key political and religious shifts over the past 40 years, from the rise of the religious right and its growing influence in the Republican Party to the conservative coalition of evangelicals and Catholics across denominational lines, to the legacy of the “outsider” celebrity president.These threads converge in Mike Pence, whose “24-karat,” “unalloyed” conservative credentials were instrumental in rallying evangelical voters behind Trump in the 2016 election and who has staked his political future on continuing to defend him.This article is republished from The Conversation, a nonprofit news site dedicated to sharing ideas from academic experts.

Fishermen heard a man yell for help. It was a naked fugitive trapped in a crocodile habitat.,"Fishermen heard a man yell for help. It was a naked fugitive trapped in a crocodile habitat.

Rod McGuirk | Associated Press

CANBERRA, Australia — Two fishermen have rescued a naked fugitive who they found sitting on a tree branch in Australian crocodile habitat.

Cam Faust said Wednesday he and fellow recreational fisher Kev Joiner heard Luke Voskresensky, 40, yell for help on Sunday as they set crab traps from their dinghy in mangroves on the outskirts of the northern city of Darwin.

Faust said Voskresensky – who was covered in mud, cuts and insect bites – had explained that he had been lost for four days, survived by eating snails and had used his clothes “for bits and pieces over the way.”

“It didn’t make sense to us,” Faust said, referring to the explanation for his nudity. “He had a nest made up in the tree, and he was only laying a meter (39 inches) above the water and there were crocs in the water so he has done well to survive.”

Joiner said the friends hesitated before bringing Voskresensky on board.

“Once we’d seen how bad he was and how many cuts he had all over him and he was dehydrated and pretty weak ... we thought we’d better get him in the boat,” Joiner said.

“We thought he just must have had a big night after New Year’s and got lost and done himself a mischief in the bush,” he added.

Faust said he stripped to his underwear and handed Voskresensky his shorts and a beer as the trio made their way back to Darwin.

“He looked like he needed a beer, although he was in a bad way,” Faust said.

An ambulance was waiting at a Darwin boat ramp when they arrived. Voskresensky was taken to a Darwin hospital, where he was placed under police guard as he was treated for exposure.

Police said Voskresensky had been free on bail after being charged with armed robbery, multiple aggravated assaults, deprivation of liberty and stealing. But he had cut off his electronic monitoring device last week and attempted to evade police.

Because he was hospitalized, Voskresensky was excused from attending court on Tuesday to face new charges of breaching bail and aggravated assault, court official Xavier La Canna said.

Voskresensky will next appear in court on Feb. 9, La Canna said.

Faust said he decided against visiting Voskresensky in the hospital after discovering he had been wanted by police.",['Rod Mcguirk'],https://news.google.com,high

At the same time, he and his future wife Karen were part of a demographic shift of Americans who “had grown up Catholic and still loved many things about the Catholic Church, but also really loved the concept of having a very personal relationship with Christ,” as a close friend put it.By the mid-1990s he was a married father of three who identified as a “born-again, evangelical Catholic,” an unusual term that has caused some consternation among both evangelicals and Catholics.In subsequent interviews, Pence has spoken freely about how his 1978 conversion gave him a “personal relationship with Jesus Christ” that “changed everything.” But he has tended to avoid labeling his religious views when pressed, referring to himself as a “pretty ordinary Christian” who “cherishes his Catholic upbringing.” He has attended nondenominational evangelical churches with his family since at least 1995. Pence’s political conversion was more clear cut. Though he voted for Jimmy Carter in the 1980 presidential election, he quickly came to embrace Ronald Reagan’s economic and social conservatism and his populist appeal. In a 2016 speech at the Reagan Library, Pence credited Reagan with inspiring him to “leave the party of my youth and become a Republican like he did.” “His broad-shouldered leadership changed my life,” he said. Pence has frequently compared Trump to Reagan, arguing that they have the same “broad shoulders.”Pence ran unsuccessfully for Congress in 1988 and 1990, and the second bruising loss precipitated a third conversion, this time in political style. In a 1991 published essay titled “Confessions of a Negative Campaigner,” he described himself as a sinner and wrote of his “conversion” to the belief that “negative campaigning is wrong.” Between 1992 and 1999, Pence honed his blend of family values and fiscal conservatism in an eponymous conservative talk show.The show’s popularity provided a springboard to a successful run for Congress in 2000. During his six terms in the House, Pence acquired a reputation for “unalloyed traditional conservatism” and principled opposition to Republican Party leadership on issues like No Child Left Behind and Medicare prescription drug expansion. Religious actsIn addition to his “unsullied” reputation as a “culture warrior,” he also attracted attention for following the “Billy Graham Rule” of avoiding meeting with women alone and avoiding events where alcohol was served when his wife was not present. During the 2016 vice presidential debate, Pence said that his entire career in public service stems from a commitment to “live out” his religious beliefs, “however imperfectly.”One of those beliefs is his opposition to abortion, grounded in his reading of particular biblical passages. As a congressman in 2007, he was the first to sponsor legislation defunding Planned Parenthood, and did so repeatedly until the first defunding bill passed in 2011. “I long for the day when Roe v. Wade is sent to the ash heap of history,” he said at the time.In 2016, over the objections of many Republican state representatives, he signed the most restrictive set of anti-abortion measures in the country into law, making him a conservative hero. Among other things, the bill prevented women from terminating pregnancies for reasons including fetal disability such as Down syndrome. Although opponents succeeded in getting the bill overturned in the courts, Indiana is still seen as one of the most anti-abortion states in America.As vice president, Pence also cast the tie-breaking Senate vote to allow states to withhold federal family planning funds from Planned Parenthood in 2017.Pence has also been an outspoken opponent of LGBTQ rights. He opposed the inclusion of sexual orientation in hate crimes legislation and the end of the military’s “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” policy. He likewise supported both state and federal constitutional amendments to ban same-sex marriage, and expressed disappointment at the 2015 Obergefell decision, which required all states to recognize such unions.At the same time he has been a strong supporter of “religious freedom,” particularly for Christians.In March 2015, as Indiana governor, he signed the state’s Religious Freedom Restoration Act “to ensure that religious liberty is fully protected.” The act ignited a firestorm of nationwide controversy: Critics alleged that it would allow for individuals and businesses to legally discriminate against members of the LGBTQ community. Under pressure from LGBTQ activists, liberals, business owners and moderate Republicans, Pence signed an amendment a week later stipulating that it did not authorize discrimination. Staked reputationPence’s religious and political biography mirrors key political and religious shifts over the past 40 years, from the rise of the religious right and its growing influence in the Republican Party to the conservative coalition of evangelicals and Catholics across denominational lines, to the legacy of the “outsider” celebrity president.These threads converge in Mike Pence, whose “24-karat,” “unalloyed” conservative credentials were instrumental in rallying evangelical voters behind Trump in the 2016 election and who has staked his political future on continuing to defend him.This article is republished from The Conversation, a nonprofit news site dedicated to sharing ideas from academic experts.

Europe starts 2021 by extending lockdowns as coronavirus cases spiral,"London (CNN) A number of European nations have kicked off 2021 in familiar fashion, locking down residents and struggling to curb Covid-19 cases. The tightened restrictions come as a new variant of the virus causes alarm among governments across the continent.

UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced a strict new national lockdown in England on Monday. The restrictions will last for at least six weeks.

""It's clear that we need to do more together to bring this new variant under control while our vaccines are rolled out,"" Johnson said in an address to the nation on Monday evening.

""In England, we must therefore go into a national lockdown which is tough enough to contain this variant. That means the government is once again instructing you to stay at home,"" he added.

Covid-19 cases in the UK hit a new daily record on Tuesday, with 60,916 new infections reported, government data shows. The UK's death toll is now more than 76,000.

Police clearing pro-Trump mob from US Capitol after rioters stormed halls of Congress,"(CNN) Police are clearing supporters of President Donald Trump from the US Capitol after they breached one of the most iconic American buildings, engulfing the nation's capital in chaos after Trump urged his supporters to fight against the ceremonial counting of the electoral votes that confirmed President-elect Joe Biden's win.

Shortly after 1 p.m. ET hundreds of pro-Trump protesters pushed through barriers set up along the perimeter of the Capitol, where they tussled with officers in full riot gear, some calling the officers ""traitors"" for doing their jobs. About 90 minutes later, police said demonstrators got into the building and the doors to the House and Senate were being locked. Shortly after, the House floor was evacuated by police.

An armed standoff took place at the House front door as of 3 p.m. ET, and police officers had their guns drawn at someone who was trying to breach it. A Trump supporter was also pictured standing at the Senate dais earlier in the afternoon. A woman is in critical condition after being shot in the chest on the Capitol grounds, according to two sources familiar with the matter. The sources could not provide further details on the circumstances of the shooting. Multiple officers have been injured with at least one transported to the hospital, multiple sources tell CNN.

Smoke grenades were used on the Senate side of the Capitol, as police work to clear the building of rioters. Windows on the west side of the Senate have been broken, and hundreds of officers are amassing on the first floor of the building.

The Senate floor was cleared of rioters as of 3:30 p.m. ET, and an officer told CNN that they have successfully squeezed them away from the Senate wing of the building and towards the Rotunda, and they are removing them out of the East and West doors of the Capitol.

ATLANTA (AP) — The Rev. Raphael Warnock, a Democrat, defeated Sen. Kelly Loeffler in Tuesday’s special election for an unexpired term for a U.S. Senate seat in Georgia. Warnock will become the first Black senator in Georgia history. It remains too early to call the second race between Democrat Jon Ossoff and Republican David Perdue, who’s seeking a second term after his first term expired Sunday. Control of the Senate is in the balance.

Here are some key takeaways:

BLACK VOTERS TIP THE SCALE

Warnock, senior pastor of the church where Martin Luther King Jr. preached through the height of the civil rights movement until his assassination, made history with a surge in Black turnout.

ADVERTISEMENT

To be sure, a narrow win out of 4.4 million votes involves plenty of variables. But Black voters were a force in the early vote and on Election Day. Notably, it wasn’t just in metro Atlanta, but also in rural and small-town counties across South Georgia, where Black turnout has historically lagged.

That means it was an alliance spanning from the most affluent Black residents of Atlanta, including recent transplants to Georgia, to those Black Georgia natives who hail from the most economically depressed pockets of the state.

This election cycle saw a confluence of factors for Black voters: 2020 offered the first general election after the disappointment of Stacey Abrams’ narrowly missing out in 2018 on becoming the first Black female governor in U.S. history, and it was the first election after the death of Rep. John Lewis, Atlanta’s civil rights icon who once marched alongside King.

Loeffler and her Republican allies used the two-month runoff campaign to hammer Warnock with ads calling him “dangerous” and “radical.” They used snippets of his sermons from Ebenezer Baptist Church to accuse him of “hate speech” and “racial” divisiveness.

But Black voters can point to Tuesday’s vote count and take credit for that strategy ending in defeat.

GEORGIA SHOWING BATTLEGROUND BONA FIDES

When President-elect Joe Biden won Georgia by 12,000 votes out of 5 million, plenty of observers assumed it was about a backlash to President Donald Trump. That certainly had something to do with it. But following it up with one Senate runoff victory and potentially a second, Democrats proved its status as a two-party battleground going forward.

TRUMP’S FALSE CLAIMS FIND FAVOR WITH GOP VOTERS

Trump may have lost the presidency, but his campaign to undermine the legitimacy of the election clearly succeeded with Republican voters in Georgia.

ADVERTISEMENT

About three-quarters of voters who backed Perdue and Loeffler told the AP VoteCast survey that Biden was not legitimately elected in November. AP VoteCast interviewed more than 3,600 voters to measure the electorate’s views on a range of topics.

Roughly 9 in 10 of the Republicans’ backers said they lacked confidence that votes in November’s presidential contest were accurately counted. Half said they have no confidence at all in the vote count. That’s roughly five times as many Republicans who said in November they had no confidence that votes would be counted accurately.

That sentiment clearly tracks Trump’s false rhetoric about election fraud, a claim that has been rejected by Attorney General William Barr, dozens of federal courts and several prominent Republican senators. And the findings demonstrate Trump’s continued hold on the Republican base, something his fellow GOP politicians will contend with even after he leaves office.

TRUMP STILL A TURNOUT DRIVER — FOR BOTH SIDES

Even though it carried risk, Perdue, who is trying to win a second term, and Loeffler, an appointed senator trying to win her first election, tethered themselves to Trump every step of the campaign.

Democrats were running stronger in the early voting than they did in November, and that had Republicans nervous. Those worries followed weeks of Trump railing that Biden stole the election, spurring GOP fears that he’d drive some of his loyalists to skip the runoff out of protest while also repelling moderate and GOP-leaning independents in urban and suburban areas.

GOP strategists felt somewhat better Tuesday as they watched turnout in conservative counties and across the outer ring of metro Atlanta where Republicans still have troves of votes.

But Democratic turnout stayed strong, as well, with Fulton and DeKalb in the core of metro Atlanta on pace to nearly match or exceed their general election turnout. That makes a steep hill for Republicans in the newfound swing state.

Full Coverage: Georgia Senate Election

RELATIVELY SMOOTH

Even with Trump’s steady drumbeat of falsehoods about the voting process, state elections authorities and officials from both parties said Tuesday’s voting and the count appeared smooth. There were no reports of hourslong lines. Elections officials also took advantage of rules changes since November that allowed advance processing of absentee ballots — so they can be counted more quickly. As the count moved into Wednesday, Georgia officials seemed to be managing the process without major issues.

KEMP FACES TROUBLE

Trump endorsed Georgia’s Republican Gov. Brian Kemp during a contentious GOP primary in 2018, only to call him “incompetent” and promise to campaign against him in 2022 because he didn’t heed the president’s demands to reverse Georgia’s presidential results.

According to AP VoteCast, Republican voters are siding with Trump: About 6 in 10 approve of Kemp’s handling of the election aftermath. In November, AP VoteCast found about 9 in 10 Trump backers approved of Kemp’s overall job performance.

Kemp already was facing the prospect of a strong general election challenge from Abrams, the Democrat who is expected to seek a rematch of her 2018 loss. She would come into the race with a boost from all her voter registration work that paid off with Biden’s and Warnock’s wins. And now Kemp has to shore up his standing in his own party before thinking about Abrams or any Democrat.

DEMOCRATS’ HIGH-TOUCH GROUND GAME

Democrats seem to have had a broader reach than Republicans in contacting voters. About 6 in 10 voters say they were contacted on behalf of Democratic candidates, compared with about half for Republican candidates.

Democrats’ ground game may have helped them turn out voters. Overall, about 4 in 10 said they were contacted and responded with a pledge or commitment to vote. These voters were more likely to favor Ossoff and Warnock than Perdue and Loeffler.

NEW RESIDENTS CHANGING POLITICS

AP VoteCast showed signs that newcomers to Georgia were more Democratic than longtime residents of the state. Those who have lived in the state for longer than 20 years leaned Republican, while those who have moved more recently favored Democrats.

Newsom proposes $600 payments to Californians in need and extending COVID-19 eviction moratorium,"With a state law protecting California tenants from pandemic-related evictions expiring at the end of this month, Gov. Gavin Newsom proposed Wednesday to extend the protections and expedite distribution of $2.6 billion in federal rental assistance for low-income tenants.

Newsom said the budget he was releasing Friday would include the rental assistance money and a $600 state stimulus check to low-income residents. Under the proposals, “Californians who have been impacted by this pandemic will get help to provide for their families and keep a roof over their heads,” Newsom said Wednesday.

Newsom said he wants legislative action on the two budget proposals this month.

Millions of Californians lost income when the COVID-19 pandemic began in March and resulted in the state issuing orders for people to stay home and businesses to reduce operations to curb the spread of the coronavirus.

Last summer, Newsom and the Legislature approved a bill that protected tenants from evictions through Jan. 31 if they are suffering financial hardship because of the pandemic and are paying at least 25% of their monthly rent.

Urgency legislation was introduced last month by Assemblyman David Chiu (D-San Francisco) to extend the protections, and Newsom said Wednesday that he supports an extension.

“California is staring down an eviction crisis, and we must keep renters in their homes,” Chiu said Wednesday. “Any way in which that is accomplished is good for California renters.”

Newsom did not say Wednesday how long an extension he would support, and a representative said that the plan is subject to negotiations with legislators. Chiu’s bill would continue the eviction moratorium for 11 months, until Dec. 31.

The governor told legislators during a videoconference call Wednesday that he is eager to see quick action on an eviction- moratorium bill.

“We will get a deal done to extend these renter protections,” Newsom told the lawmakers.

Landlords are concerned about extending the eviction moratorium until December and want to make sure there is adequate financial help for property owners facing the loss of rental income, said Debra Carlton, an executive vice president of the California Apartment Assn., which represents landlords.

“Any extension must be short term and must come with added state dollars to help owners with the unpaid rent,” Carlton said Wednesday. “The federal dollars won’t cover what’s owed in California.

The governor’s office said the $2.6 billion in federal rental assistance for low-income households in California will also help reduce the financial burden of small rental property owners who are struggling, including those who have not been receiving full rent payments from tenants.

The money and the tenant protections, “will keep as many people housed as possible and help get California’s economy back on its feet,” the governor’s office said in a statement.

The governor also proposed Wednesday to provide a “Golden State Stimulus” that would refund $600 to 2019 taxpayers who received a California earned income tax credit in 2020, as well as to 2020 taxpayers with individual taxpayer identification numbers who are eligible for and receive the tax credit in 2021. Those receiving the payments would include immigrants in the country illegally who file tax forms.

Residents may be eligible for the earned income tax credit if they have annual incomes of $30,000 or less. Last year, 3.9 million tax returns were filed that were eligible.

The stimulus payments would be sent out to tax year 2019 CalEITC recipients in February and March.

“The timing of these refunds is meant to immediately help low-income households with expenses like food and rent,” the governor’s office said.

Newsom announced the proposals during Wednesday’s videoconference call, which included Assemblywoman Eloise Reyes (D-Grand Terrace), who said the $600 stimulus check to low-income residents is essential to helping them make ends meet.

“It is clear that the economic consequences of the pandemic have devastated families across the state,” Reyes said. “We can and we must do more to provide assistance to get them through this difficult time, particularly those most impacted.”

The state stimulus checks will cost an estimated $2.4 billion. The proposal is in addition to a $600 federal stimulus check approved by Congress so some low-income residents will get both, or $1,200, Reyes said.","['Staff Writer', 'Patrick Mcgreevy Is A Reporter Covering California State Government', 'Politics In The Sacramento Bureau.

Those exercising must maintain nine feet of distance from others and fitness classes will be limited to 25 people at a time. All will be required to wear masks. Pools are to open for the limited purpose of lap swim, lessons, and organized sports activities.

Indoor entertainment—including bowling alleys, movie theaters, and museums—and events will be permitted, at 25% capacity and capped at 150 people, the governor's office said. Masks will be required and if food is served, guidelines must match those followed by bars and restaurants.

Sporting events will be limited to 250 spectators for outdoor sports, and 150 for indoor events. Masks will be required. The governor's office reported inter-region tournaments and out-of-state play are discouraged.

The numerical cap, which was previously set at 250 people, is expected to be lifted, for religious services. Places of worship remain open at 50% capacity now, according to the governor's office, but without that overall maximum numerical capacity.

Additionally, the governor's office states wedding receptions and other private parties may resume with limits. If food and drink are served at the event, then the event is limited to two households or 10 people indoors, and three households or 15 people outdoors. If food or drink is not served, then those events are covered by event venue guidelines.

"Michigan to begin COVID-19 vaccinations for first responders, teachers & next week","LANSING, Mich. (WXYZ) — The State of Michigan will begin vaccinating more frontline workers like teachers and police, and senior citizens, against the coronavirus next week.

Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and Michigan Department of Health and Human Services Chief Medical Executive Dr. Joneigh Khaldun made the announcement during a press conference on Wednesday.

According to the MDHHS, these groups will be able to start getting vaccinations.

Michiganders age 65 and older

Police officers

First responders

Frontline state and federal workers

Jail and prison staff

PreK-12 teachers and childcare providers

The state is accelerating the plan to vaccinate those 65 and older as 80% of the deaths from COVID-19 come from that age group.

“The more people we can get the safe and effective vaccine, the faster we can return to a sense of normalcy,” Whitmer said in a release. “I urge all seniors to get the COVID-19 vaccine as soon as possible and that all Michiganders make a plan to get vaccinated when it becomes available to you. And as always: mask up, practice safe social distancing, and avoid indoor gatherings where COVID-19 can easily spread from person to person. We will eliminate this virus together.”

“We are pleased to move the state forward in the next stage of vaccinations,” Khaldun added.. “These vaccines are safe and effective, and we especially want our first responders, teachers and older adults to get vaccinated as soon as possible. The strategy we are announcing today is efficient, effective, and equitable, focusing on making vaccine available to those who have the highest level of risk, whether it is because of where they work or because of their age.”

The phases of the vaccination are below.

Phase 1A: Paid and unpaid persons serving in healthcare settings who have the potential for direct or indirect exposure to patients or infectious materials and are unable to work from home as well as residents in long term care facilities.

Phase 1B: Persons 75 years of age or older and frontline essential workers in critical infrastructure.

Phase 1C: Individuals 16 years of age or older at high risk of severe illness due to COVID-19 infection and some other essential workers whose position impacts life, safety and protection during the COVID-19 response.

Phase 2: Individuals 16 years of age or older.

Senior citizens are urged to visit Michigan.gov/COVIDVaccine [lnks.gd] to find local health departments and other local vaccine clinics near them that are ready to book appointments.

Those essential workers will be notified by their employers about vaccine clinic dates and locations.

More than 140,000 doses of the Moderna and Pfizer vaccine have been administered since it became available last month in Michigan.

Trump supporters’ last-ditch downtown DC election protests got off to a bleak start,"President Donald Trump is still refusing to concede the 2020 election to President-elect Joe Biden — and his most fervent supporters are on the same page.

As part of Trump’s last-ditch effort to overturn Biden’s victory, he and his supporters (in and out of Congress) have been hyping Congress’s expected certification of Biden’s Electoral College victory Wednesday as the final opportunity to “stop the steal.” Trump fans planned a slate of protests near the Capitol building in Washington, DC, starting with rallies on Tuesday. Yet another will take place on Wednesday, at which Trump himself says he will speak.

And they’re not off to a great start.

Trump fans began gathering on Tuesday in Freedom Plaza and outside the Capitol, where recently pardoned Trump ally Roger Stone spoke. At the Freedom Plaza event, a variety of fringe far-right speakers alternately profanely denounced antifa, said George Soros “owns” Supreme Court Justice John Roberts, described the coronavirus as “fake” — and, in one especially shocking moment, even encouraged rally attendees, who gathered mostly without masks despite the coronavirus pandemic, to hug each other.

“It’s a mass-spreader event!” said podcast host Clay Clark.

""I'm going to give everyone three action steps ... turn to the person next to you and give them a hug. Someone you don't know ... it's a mass-spreader event! It's a mass-spreader event!"" pic.twitter.com/NVRN9HdzSl — Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) January 5, 2021

From the livestream, it’s difficult to see how many (if any) rally-goers followed his advice.

Later, staunch Trump ally and MyPillow founder Mike Lindell pushed long-debunked conspiracy theories about how Democrats allegedly stuffed ballot boxes. He also alluded to the possibility of civil war if Trump’s loss isn’t somehow overturned.

“You need to pray for our vice president to look up to God and say, ‘I need to make a decision, Lord,’ and make the right decision for our country,” Lindell said, alluding to Mike Pence’s role overseeing Wednesday’s Electoral College certification process. “You don’t have a [civil] war when the other side didn’t win anything ... they were trying to steal it from us.”

And another speech Tuesday evening featured a “victory or death!” chant.

Trump has heavily promoted the Wednesday portion of the event, touting it on Twitter as a “BIG Protest Rally” that “could be the biggest event in Washington, DC, history” — one aimed at pressuring members of Congress to stop the “steal” of the election from him. On Tuesday afternoon, he tweeted that he plans to speak to his supporters at 11 am on Wednesday. In other tweets, he echoed the rhetoric speakers at the rally used by calling antifa “a Terrorist Organization” and cited the size of the gatherings to put pressure on Republican senators who so far have not joined his effort to overthrow the election.

I hope the Democrats, and even more importantly, the weak and ineffective RINO section of the Republican Party, are looking at the thousands of people pouring into D.C. They won’t stand for a landslide election victory to be stolen. @senatemajldr @JohnCornyn @SenJohnThune — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 5, 2021

Of course, the election was not stolen — the Trump campaign hasn’t produced any credible evidence of fraud, and court after court has rejected Trump’s claims — and with the legal process played out, there’s little Trump and his allies can do at this point to overturn the election results. The rallies on Tuesday and Wednesday ultimately are a step in the grieving process for Trump supporters who will soon have to adjust to life under President Biden, as well as a window into what a significant portion of the Republican base looks like post-Trump.

While Clark’s public encouragement of coronavirus spread is definitely problematic, it’s also important to note that people still have a right to peaceably assemble, even in cases where speakers spread blatant lies and anti-Semitic conspiracy theories. But authorities are worried that Wednesday’s pro-Trump rallies could turn out likes ones last month that culminated in violence.

DC police are bracing for more unrest

During the most recent pro-Trump rallies in DC — which took place on December 12, two days before the Electoral College voted to officially make Biden president-elect — four people were stabbed during an altercation involving the Proud Boys, a far-right, racist, street-fighting group that was name-checked by Trump during one of the presidential debates. Authorities also say Proud Boys were responsible for burning a Black Lives Matter banner that hung outside the historically Black Metropolitan African Methodist Episcopal Church.

There are indications that the Proud Boys planned to take things a step further this time around. On the right-wing social media site Parler, group chairman Enrique Tarrio wrote last week that the Proud Boys “will turn out in record numbers on January 6th but this time with a twist” — wearing all-black so members can blend in with left-wing counterprotesters.

“We are going to smell like you, move like you, and look like you,” Tarrio wrote. “The only thing we’ll do that’s us is think like us! Jan 6th is gonna be epic.”

But Tarrio was arrested while traveling into DC on Monday on property destruction charges stemming from the alleged December church vandalism. Ominously, Tarrio was also charged with “possession of high-capacity ammunition feeding devices, which is a legal term for a magazine that allows guns to hold additional bullets,” the Washington Post reported, adding that “the devices were found during the arrest.”

In an effort to prevent violence, DC police banned all firearms in the vicinity of where the pro-Trump rallies are planned, and Mayor Muriel Bowser has urged residents to stay away from the area. Tess Owen of Vice reported that the arrest of Tarrio and perceptions that police aren’t standing with pro-Trump protesters have caused a bit of a schism between far-right agitators and the cops, with “Tarrio’s supporters and ardent Trump fans ... putting the DC Police Department in their crosshairs” on right-wing social media sites. One Parler post even threatened to burn down a DC police precinct.

If the past is precedent, Trump is far more likely to pour fuel on the fire than he is to try and tamp things down, especially considering that things won’t go his way inside the Capitol on Wednesday. Ultimately, if the worst that happens is more reckless hugging during a pandemic, then DC authorities will chalk up Wednesday as a success.","['Aaron Rupar', 'Andrew Prokop', 'Li Zhou', 'Sara Morrison', 'Jen Kirby', 'Jan']",https://news.google.com,high
Mitch McConnell Will Lose Control Of The Senate As Democrats Have Swept The Georgia Runoffs,"WASHINGTON — Democrats have won control of the Senate after winning two runoff elections in Georgia Tuesday. Those victories will end six years of Republican Senate control under Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.

Democrats Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock defeated Republican Sens. David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler, respectively, on Tuesday night, becoming the first Democrats to represent the state in the Senate since 2000.

The victories bring Democrats up to 50 seats in the chamber, tied with the 50 seats held by Republicans. But incoming vice president Kamala Harris casts the tiebreaking vote, giving Democrats the power to take control. Democrats will control both chambers of Congress as well as the White House, a level of power the party hasn’t held since the start of 2011 under then-president Barack Obama.

Senate control is pivotal for President-elect Joe Biden’s chances to enact his agenda because he no longer has to go through McConnell. Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York, the current Senate minority leader, is expected to take over as majority leader. It is a massively powerful role, as the majority leader controls the floor schedule and can cause or block votes on any piece of legislation.

“It feels like a brand new day,"" said Schumer in a statement Wednesday morning. ""For the first time in six years, Democrats will operate a majority in the United States Senate — and that will be very good for the American people.""



Schumer promised to pass ""bold change"" and to address the COVID pandemic that is causing around 200,000 new confirmed cases each day. ""Help is on the way,"" he said.

Neither Loeffler nor Perdue has yet conceded their race. Perdue released a statement promising to ""exhaust every legal recourse"" to ensure votes are properly counted. Speaking to supporters shortly after midnight, Loeffler called her race ""a game of inches"" in which she would eventually come out on top. ""There are a lot of votes out there, as y'all know, and we have a path to victory and we're staying on it,"" she said.

McConnell used his power as majority leader to great effect, stonewalling bills passed in the House by both Democrats and Republicans. Rather than vote down those bills in the Senate, McConnell simply ignored them, never letting them go to a vote. Over the four years of Trump’s term, McConnell’s Senate has hardly passed any substantial legislation, despite Republicans controlling both chambers of Congress for the first two of those years. A Republican tax cut bill in 2017 and a bipartisan criminal justice reform bill in 2018 were among the rare exceptions.

Instead, McConnell focused on confirming conservative judges. He was able to confirm 218 federal judges to lifetime appointments under Trump, including three Supreme Court justices. “A lot of what we’ve done over the past four years will be undone, sooner or later, by the next election,” McConnell said last month during the confirmation of Justice Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court. “They won’t be able to do much about this for a long time to come.”

McConnell’s disinterest in passing legislation enraged Democrats — and also drew frustration from some Republicans in the House and the Senate.

Aside from failing to repeal Obamacare after years of promising to do so, high-profile, bipartisan efforts on gun control, immigration, and healthcare all ended up dying on the floor of the Senate. McConnell also presided over two significant government shutdowns, including the longest federal shutdown in US history from December 2018 to January 2019.

Democrats will be under intense pressure to do away with the legislative filibuster, which requires 60 votes to actually get to a vote on a bill. The filibuster means Democrats will need to get at least 10 Republicans to support any bill they want to pass.

Democrats could do away with the filibuster with a simple majority vote. But their narrow margin of power means every single Democratic senator (plus the vice president) would need to support the move. That is unlikely to happen. Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin has publicly sworn that he will not vote to end the filibuster.

If you have a news tip, we’d like to hear from you. Reach out to us via one of our tip line channels.

Still, Democrats will have one chance per year to bypass Republicans altogether and try to pass major legislation. Each year the Senate can pass a budget reconciliation bill, which is exempt from the filibuster and only needs a majority to pass. In theory, these bills need to pertain to the federal budget, but that can be interpreted widely. Republicans tried to use a budget reconciliation bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act, only to fail to gain 50 Republican votes.

The Georgia results give Biden’s ability to tackle the climate crisis, one of his priorities, a big boost. The new Senate opens the door to raising spending, whether it relates to the federal budget or the next coronavirus aid package, on climate, resiliency, and environmental justice efforts. There’s also now a greater chance that Congress confirms Biden’s environmental appointees.

But the incoming administration still faces an uphill battle in passing any new, bold climate laws, the kind needed to meet Biden’s goal of dramatically cutting climate pollution from the transportation, buildings, and energy sectors in the coming decades.","['Ryan Brooks', 'Paul Mcleod', 'Zoe Tillman', 'Buzzfeed News Reporter']",https://news.google.com,high

WASHINGTON (AP) —

The Justice Department disclosed on Wednesday that it was among the federal agencies harmed by a massive breach of government networks that U.S. officials have linked to Russia.

The extent of the damage was unclear. The department said that 3% of its Microsoft Office 365 email accounts were potentially affected, but did not say to whom those accounts belonged. There are no indications that classified systems were affected, the agency said.

ADVERTISEMENT

The department said it detected on Dec. 24 “previously unknown malicious activity” linked to the broader intrusions of federal agencies revealed earlier that month, according to a statement from spokesman Marc Raimondi.

The statement came one day after federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies formally implicated Russia in the intrusions, which officials said were part of a suspected intelligence gathering operation. President Donald Trump had previously raised without evidence the idea that China could be to blame.

The hacking campaign was extraordinary in scale, with the intruders having stalked through government agencies, defense contractors and telecommunications companies for months by the time the breach was discovered. Experts say that gave the foreign agents ample time to collect data that could be highly damaging to U.S. national security, though the scope of the breaches and exactly what information was sought is unknown.

Full Coverage: Technology

An estimated 18,000 organizations were affected by malicious code that piggybacked on popular network-management software from an Austin, Texas, company called SolarWinds. Of those customers, though, “a much smaller number has been compromised by follow-on activity on their systems,” the statement said, noting that fewer than 10 federal government agencies have so far been identified as falling into that category.",['Eric Tucker'],https://news.google.com,high
Newsweek's positive coverage of Bitcoin underscores paradigm shift in public perception,"Newsweek, one of the largest American weekly news magazines, has taken a positive spin on Bitcoin (BTC) in a recent article that explores whether the digital asset can become the new gold standard.

The article, which appeared on Wednesday, dissects the digital gold narrative using JPMorgan Chase’s latest model showing a potential BTC price of $146,000. Although the article presents little new information for crypto enthusiasts who have been charting Bitcoin’s meteoric rise, it provides more validation that the mainstream narrative surrounding cryptocurrency has changed.

“All that glitters is not gold—but it might be Bitcoin,” wrote Scott Reeves. “And in the long run, it might be more valuable.”

That’s the message that appeared before Newsweek’s readership, which is pegged in the tens of millions, many of whom have never been exposed to Bitcoin.

Earlier this week, Bitcoin graced the front page of the Financial Times — on the 12th anniversary of genesis block, no less — offering further evidence that the mainstream can no longer ignore BTC.

In the meantime, more investors are flooding the market, as evidenced by the sharp rise in active addresses and growing interest from corporations and major institutions.

New adopters are entering Bitcoin for the long run, possibly for the next three to five years at least, according to podcaster Peter McCormack. Sonny Singh, BitPay’s chief commercial officer, shares that sentiment, but recently argued that another surge in BTC price could lead to institutional profit-taking.

Google search trends suggest that retail FOMO, or fear of missing out, is ramping up in the new year — a potential precursor to higher prices in the short term.

Google searches for the word ""Bitcoin"" in the United States by Google

Searches for the word “Bitcoin” were tame during last year’s uptrend when compared with the bull market of 2017. Once again, this suggests that Bitcoin’s least resistant path could be higher.

It remains to be seen whether retail’s understanding of Bitcoin is improving or whether people are paying attention merely because of price appreciation. In either case, Bitcoin’s value proposition is no longer relegated to obscure and esoteric corners of the internet.",['Sam Bourgi'],https://news.google.com,high
"Why Sundial, Grow Generation, and Other Cannabis Stocks Skyrocketed Today","What happened

Wednesday is shaping up to be a great day for cannabis investors. Marijuana stocks are soaring following election results on Tuesday that have the potential to reshape the industry.

Here's how some of the more popular cannabis stocks are performing as of 10:30 a.m. EST:

Sundial Growers NASDAQ:SNDL)

Cronos Group NASDAQ:CRON)

GrowGeneration NASDAQ:GRWG)

OrganiGram Holdings NASDAQ:OGI)

Curaleaf Holdings OTC:CURLF)

Village Farms International NASDAQ:VFF)

Green Thumb Industries OTC:GTBIF)

So what

It's looking increasingly likely that the Democrats will be able to win two Senate seats in crucial runoff elections in Georgia. Multiple news outlets have declared Democratic candidate Raphael Warnock the winner against Republican Sen. Kelly Loeffler. Meanwhile, Democratic candidate Jon Ossoff has a slight lead over Republican Sen. David Perdue.

Should the Democrats pick up both seats, they would effectively gain control over the Senate. At that point, the Democrats and Republicans would each have 50 Senate seats, which would give Vice President-elect Kamala Harris the ability to cast a tie-breaking vote once she and President-elect Joe Biden take office on Jan. 20.

Now what

Marijuana producers and dispensaries -- including Sundial, Cronos Group, OrganiGram, Curaleaf, and Village Farms -- would all benefit if the Democrats win the Senate.

Biden and Harris have promised to decriminalize marijuana, which would make it easier for cannabis companies to operate in the U.S. As an example, banks would no doubt be more willing to lend and offer cash management services to cannabis companies if it's no longer a federal crime to do so.

Decriminalization would also be a boon for companies like GrowGeneration, which, while not marijuana producers themselves, help to support the industry's growth. Demand for GrowGeneration's hydroponic and organic gardening supplies would rise if marijuana were decriminalized, and these rising sales, in turn, could help to drive its stock price even higher.","['Joe Tenebruso', 'Tmfguardian', 'Joe Honed His Investing Skills As An Analyst For Stock Advisor', 'Supernova', 'Fool One.

UPDATE: Canadian cannabis company Sundial says has issued notice of default to Zenabis regarding senior loan,"Canadian cannabis company Sundial Grower's Inc.

"Increase Your Retirement Income by $9,500 Annually with This One Decision","You've likely heard financial experts tout the wisdom of delaying retirement. A few extra years of working can deliver higher Social Security income and a fatter savings balance. But the real question is, what's the dollar value of those outcomes?

If you're at all worried about making ends meet once your paycheck goes away, you should know how to estimate the value of postponing your retirement. As you'll see below, the average worker could increase retirement income by $9,500 a year, simply by working an extra five years. And you might have an even greater opportunity available to you.

Higher Social Security income

You can claim Social Security as early as age 62. That's not the best option financially, though. The earlier you claim, the lower your benefit. You only qualify for your full benefit as calculated from your earnings history when you reach Full Retirement Age, or FRA. Your FRA is based on your birth year. For anyone born after 1942, FRA is at least 66 years old, but could be as high as 67.

You can learn the formula that discounts your benefit for claiming early, but there is an easier approach. Create an account at my Social Security and log in to view your benefit estimates at different claiming ages. Note the substantial difference in benefits between claiming at 62 versus claiming at FRA.

According to the Social Security Quick Calculator, a 60-year-old worker (born June 15, 1960) earning $56,680, for example, stands to receive $1,126 in monthly Social Security income when benefits start at age 62 and one month. But if that worker delays Social Security until age 67, the benefit rises to $1,710 monthly. In return for five years of patience, this worker gets an income increase of $584 per month, or $7,008 per year. The increase comes largely from delaying benefits, but also from working an extra five years at a peak salary.

Higher savings for larger retirement distributions

Postponing retirement is also good for your savings balance. The more paychecks you earn, the more retirement contributions you can make. To quantify that, look up your contribution rate and add it to your employer match rate. Apply that percentage to your salary to calculate your total monthly contributions. You can then use an investment calculator to estimate how those contributions will grow in the years you postpone retirement.

We can use our average senior worker making $56,680 annually to demonstrate the math. Let's say our senior saver has a contribution rate of 15% and is also earning 3% in employer match. That's a total contribution of 18%, which works out to about $10,000 a year, or $850 monthly. In five years, that's an extra $50,000 in contributions -- plus any earnings on top of those contributions.

You can estimate those earnings, though it is a bit of guesswork. The stock market can be volatile in time periods of five years or less. That's one reason why you should reduce your exposure to stocks as you near retirement. You might set up your portfolio to be 50% or 60% stocks, for example, with the rest in bonds and cash. You'll see lower growth rates, closer to 4% or 5%, rather than the stock market's long-term average of 7%. But you'll have also have less volatility. That lowers the chances that a bout of market turbulence will strip value from your investments, just when you're about to start taking retirement distributions.

At a 5% return, the $850 in monthly contributions should grow to about $58,000 in five years. To calculate how those extra funds affect retirement income, multiply the $58,000 by 4%. This is based on the rule of thumb that you can safely withdraw 4% of your retirement savings annually. 4% of $58,000 is $2,320.

The $2,320 in higher retirement plan distributions combined with the Social Security increase of $7,008 gets you to a total retirement income increase of $9,328 per year. That's a pretty significant sum, especially considering the numbers are based on a working salary of $56,680.

Crunch your numbers

Number-crunching may not be your favorite activity, but it's a useful skill with respect to retirement planning. If you're stressed about not having enough income in retirement, you can run through some scenarios to gauge how your situation changes based on timing. You may decide that an extra few years of work is worth it for the breathing room it'll give you in your senior years.","['Catherine Brock', 'Tmfcatherinejb', 'Catherine Grew Up In Southern California Wearing A Lot Of Black', 'Trying To Perfect The Art Of Sarcasm.

Dow Closes at Record as Trump Supporters Storm Capitol,"The Dow closes at a record as the U.S. Capitol is locked down after supporters of President Donald Trump stormed past barricades.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at a record Wednesday as the U.S. Capitol was locked down after supporters of President Donald Trump stormed past barricades and breached the building.

President-Elect Joe Biden condemned the mob attack by Trump supporters on the U.S. Capitol, saying ""our democracy is under unprecedented assault.""

""I call on President Trump to go on national television now to fulfill his oath and defend the Constitution and demand an end to this siege.""

Trump had earlier called on his supporters to ""remain peaceful,"" but he did not urge them to disperse, AP reported.

Vice President Mike Pence had been escorted off the Senate floor during the count of the Electoral College votes certifying President-elect Joe Biden's win.

Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser declared a curfew in the district from 6 p.m. till 6 a.m. Thursday.

The Associated Press reported that the D.C. National Guard was being activated for tasks possibly including helping enforce the curfew.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Majority Leader Nancy Pelosi issued a joint statement calling on Trump to ""demand that all protestors leave the U.S. Capitol and Capitol Grounds immediately,"" AP reported.

Several Republican lawmakers called upon Trump to call for an end to the violence, NBC reported.

""Mr. President @realDonaldTrump the men & women of law enforcement are under assault. It is crucial you help restore order by sending resources to assist the police and ask those doing this to stand down,"" tweeted Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla.

The Dow closed up 437 points, or 1.44%, to 30,829 and the S&P 500 gained 0.57% to 3,748.

Both the Dow and S&P 500 reached record intraday highs.

The Nasdaq finished down 0.61% to 12,740 after falling sharply earlier in the session on concern that big technology companies could face tougher antitrust scrutiny under a Democratic-Party-controlled Congress.

Rev. Raphael Warnock, a Democrat, beat Republican Sen. Kelly Loeffler in Georgia, winning one of two Senate runoffs in the state.

And the AP has called the other Georgia runoff race for Democrat Jon Ossoff against Republican Sen. David Perdue.

The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note hit 1% for the first time since March.

The elections in Georgia have given the Democrats control of Congress and enabled them to push the legislative agenda of President-elect Joe Biden.

The Democrats in the Senate are on even footing with Republicans, enabling Vice President-elect Kamala Harris to cast the deciding vote in any 50-50 tie.

Analysts say a swing to the Democrats could lead to greater fiscal stimulus and higher taxes. Just one Republican win in Georgia would have given the GOP enough votes to block Biden from pursuing his more ambitious policies on trade, energy and security.

""Stock markets have been moving higher for the past few months, and it is more likely that we see a sector rotation within the market rather than a sustained selloff in the result that the Democrats take full control of government,"" said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer at Independent Advisor Alliance.

Federal Reserve officials, in the minutes of its meeting from December, unanimously backed keeping the central bank's pace of bond buying steady.

“All participants judged that it would be appropriate to continue those purchases at least at the current pace, and nearly all favored maintaining the current composition of purchases,” according to the minutes of the meeting.

Private payrolls at U.S. companies unexpectedly fell by 123,000 during December, the first decline since April, as the coronavirus pandemic crimped hiring, particularly in the leisure and hospitality and retail industries.",['Joseph Woelfel'],https://news.google.com,high
Samsung QLED TVs take on OLED with Neo Mini-LED precision dimming,"Drew Evans/CNET

CES

Samsung, the biggest TV company in the world, is following up a blockbuster year of sales with new 2021 models that tout even better picture quality and more extras aimed at people spending extra time at home. Its massive, incredibly expensive MicroLED TVs steal the headlines around CES but its lineup of QLED TVs comprise the company's bread and butter.

This year the best Samsung QLED models, including TVs with both 4K and 8K resolution, are called Neo QLED. The name isn't necessarily a reference to Matrix 4 but does include plenty of futuristic-sounding tech, all aimed at dethroning the OLED TVs made by rivals like LG and Sony, which continue to beat QLED in my tests for picture quality.

Now playing: Watch this: Samsung's new Neo QLED TVs promise better picture, gaming...

At the heart of Neo QLED TVs lies a new Mini-LED based, full-array local dimming backlight array that boosts brightness and provides more precise light control. Samsung made its LEDs 40 times smaller than conventional LED units, allowing more to be packed into the TV, and even added a (wait for it...) ""quantum matrix"" to help direct the LED light more accurately. The result, according to the company, is improved HDR highlights with minimal blooming (stray illumination that bleeds from bright into dark areas) as well as better shadow detail.

Samsung also improved its AI upscaling this year to use multiple neural networks (as opposed to just one in previous years) to tweak image quality on both 4K and 8K models.

Neo QLED technology will appear in all of Samsung's 2021 8K QLED models (the QN800A, QN850A and QN900A series), as well as two series of 4K QLED (the QN85A and QN90A). As usual pricing was not announced but if the Q85T is in the same price ballpark as the 2020 Q80T, currently selling for $1,500 at the 65-inch size, it'll be cheaper than OLED and squarely targeted at midpriced TV shoppers.

Beyond the picture, Samsung's new QLED TVs offer a few other new features for 2021.

Samsung

Rechargeable remote with solar cell: In a nod to sustainability Samsung's new remote uses rechargeable batteries instead of disposable ones, which Samsung says could save 20 million AAA batteries every year. In addition to a USB-C port, the clicker can be charged via a solar cell on the back, which even works with indoor lighting.

Game status display and ultrawide aspect ratio: Samsung's new TVs continue to support the next-generation gaming features of PS5 and Xbox Series X, including 4K/120 fps input and VRR, but new for this year you can long-press on the play/pause button of the remote to call up a special status screen, dubbed Game Bar, that clearly indicates which of those features are currently active. You can also play the game in 21:9 or even 32:9 aspect ratios, with black bars filling in the remainder of the TVs' 16:9 screen.

Jillian Michaels is the first of six to provide workout content. The smart trainer feature is available on 2021 Q70A TVs and above.

Google Duo video chat: Using an optional webcam again, the Duo app on Samsung TVs allows up to 12 others to join the chat. And if you don't have a camera plugged in you can screen mirror Duo on your phone to the TV and use its camera. It's not Google's more popular Meet software, but at least it's web chat on the big screen.

Google Assistant, Alexa and Bixby voice built-in: Last year Samsung TVs also offered all three voice assistants available via the remote, which included both push-to-talk and hands-free access. In 2021 the company's remotes are push-to-talk only and far-field hands-free mics, which respond to wake words like ""Alexa"" and ""Hey, Google,"" are built into the Q70A and higher TVs. As always you can disable the mics entirely.

Microsoft cloud services, wireless Dex: Connect an optional keyboard and mouse to create or edit Microsoft 365 documents, and even work on two simultaneously on the big screen. Samsung is also expanding the capabilities of its Dex feature, available on Samsung Galaxy phones and tablets, to connect wirelessly.

Samsung's 2021 TVs will start shipping later this year. Exact model names, series and pricing were not announced, and as usual we'll have to wait for the reviews to see how well Neo QLED actually stands up to good old OLED.",['David Katzmaier'],https://news.google.com,high
Amazon marked free podcasts as costing $8.95 with a discount for Audible subscribers,"Charlie Harding, the host of the podcast Switched On Pop, noticed something strange when he searched his podcast name on Amazon yesterday: a price tag.

Harding’s show, which details the making and meaning of popular music, is already freely available in all podcast apps through an RSS feed. It also recently became available for free inside Audible, which is owned by Amazon, when podcasts were added to its app in October. But for some reason, Amazon had started advertising the show as paid content. Even more strangely, the Audible promotion was really for a price hike, marking the show as originally costing $0 and being marked up to $8.95.

The same happened with other podcasts available in Audible, too. All the ones we checked, including The Verge’s own Vergecast, which is freely distributed through RSS, were listed as costing $8.95 and promoted an Audible membership deal. These results only showed up on Amazon’s website, not in the mobile app, and only if you were logged into an Amazon account when you searched. If you clicked on the podcast, you’d then be able to select where you wanted to listen, either Amazon Music or Audible, and you could listen for free without a subscription.

The pricing disappeared Wednesday morning after The Verge reached out for comment. Amazon has not yet responded.

It’s unclear why Amazon marked the shows as costing $8.95 given that none of Audible’s subscription tiers are that price. Its lowest tier, which it launched in August, costs $7.95 for access to these free shows, as well as exclusive Audible programming and audiobooks. The price goes up to $14.95 for a subscription that includes audiobook credits. This seems more than likely to be a bug given that the shows’ prices were raised instead of lowered as part of this “limited deal,” but still, it’s not a great look for Amazon, which just recently started focusing on podcasts.

The addition of podcasts is part of Audible’s latest push to sell subscriptions. The freely available shows add value to a costly subscription and bulk up its catalog, which might entice people to pay every month for access. It’s worth remembering, though, that most podcasts are available for free through RSS, not when you pay Audible.","['Ashley Carman', 'Jan']",https://news.google.com,high

Sony Unveils Crystal LED Displays for Virtual Production,"The displays were developed by Sony Electronics in collaboration with Sony Pictures Entertainment, with an eye toward production uses.

Just prior to next week's virtual CES, Sony Electronics announced a pair of new Crystal LED modular direct view displays aimed at professional applications including virtual production — an area that has experienced an uptick in interest during the past year and has been used on projects from The Midnight Sky to The Mandalorian.

Sony calls attention to the C-series for its high contrast ratio and B-series for accentuating high brightness. Sony reports that the B-series was developed in collaboration with Sony Pictures Entertainment to reflect the needs of production. For instance, it features an anti-reflection coating with a matte finish, with an eye toward virtual sets.

Both series are equipped with Sony's ""X1 for Crystal LED” processor and incorporate the same Crystal LED technology used in its Bravia TVs. Features include the ability to display high dynamic range images, high frame rates up to 120 frames per second and stereoscopic 3D. They are also fanless, for quieter operation.

A virtual production environment using the tech giant's current display technology (which was initially unveiled for additional uses including digital cinema) can be found at Sony's Digital Media Production Center, an L.A.-based venture for filmmakers. That setup was featured in the Sony exhibition a year ago at CES 2020.

The new Crystal LED C-series and B-series are planned to be available this summer. Pricing wasn't announced.","['Carolyn Giardina', 'Carolyn.Giardina Thr.Com']",https://news.google.com,high

Intel Pivots Its RealSense Cameras Into Facial Recognition Tech,"Image : Intel

Intel announced today that it will make its RealSense 3D cameras available for customers hoping to utilize the tech for faster facial recognition in the form of RealSense ID. The move comes months after competitor Amazon shied away from its own facial recognition program, which has been accused of perpetuating dangerous racial biases and endangering people of color.

Intel’s move is a little different. Amazon previously sold its Reckognition program to police departments and government organizations. The program was notorious for eliciting false positives and placing minorities in danger. Intel’s RealSense isn’t simply an algorithm applied to data recorded from traditional cameras. It’s a camera combined with a depth sensor that’s capable of recording data in three dimensions, and Intel claims much of the data that could concern privacy advocates will be stored directly on the device, which uses algorithms to positively ID users. This means unique images of you shouldn’t be leaving the confines of the device.

RealSense cameras have been around for over half a decade and are liked by tinkerers for their ability to scan 3D spaces while capturing video data. However, the popularity of alternative products, like Apple’s Face ID, which also combines a camera’s data with data gathered by infrared lasers, have surged in popularity, leaving RealSense without much to do.

Intel’s found uses. At one CES, the company made a scan of me in seconds that was converted into a laser sculpted paperweight. Another year it showed off the ability of RealSense to control a wheelchair with facial gestures. Yet RealSense isn’t typically used by laptop makers to open laptops via facial recognition—most rely on other cameras that work with Windows Hello. Nor is it often found in phones or in devices intended for gesture-based computing.

Now Intel will be selling RealSense cameras as RealSense ID, and it will be available either on a board or in an all-in-one plug and play package. Intel says it’s been tested on a variety of skin types and nationalities on every continent and shouldn’t elicit false positives or negatives —though I’m sure we’ll hear more about that from privacy advocates if RealSense ID starts to take off. It also claims it will work around the masks typically worn to protect against covid-19, with glasses, and even if the subject ages or grows substantial facial hair. In a demo for journalists, Intel showed the camera positively identifying someone regardless of what they were wearing on or around their face but failing when a picture of the person was used on a phone. Intel claims it’s more spoof-proof than competing facial recognition tech with a chance of false detections being one in a million—on par with the claimed rate of Face ID.

While Intel has repeatedly obliquely compared the RealSense camera to those found in consumer devices, the new module and board aren’t expected to be used in a laptop or a phone. Intel was reluctant to talk about possible integration with Windows Hello and instead said the camera could be used alongside a smart lock to open doors, or even with an ATM in lieu of a debit card.

Intel apparently envisions RealSense ID as a solution for fast authentication in the real world. Which has me a little wary. Is a one-in-a-million chance of a false ID enough security to make you comfortable getting money out of your bank account with just your face, or getting through security at the airport? Intel does say the facial ID data is image-free and capable of only being read by the RealSense ID algorithm, and the system-on-chip built into the product, and it does not appear that it will be used quite like Amazon’s Reckognition and some other facial recognition tech that has raised the ire of privacy advocates (though there’s no word yet on if law enforcement is interested or how it would even use it) . Still, Intel, and its partners, will have a long, long way to go to make consumers comfortable with scanning their face to open a door.",[],https://news.google.com,high
This is what happens when your Nintendo Switch account gets banned,"Sean Buckley / CNET

It all started with Fortnite.

My brother had taken up gaming during the 2020 lockdown and wanted me to show him what this ""battle royale"" thing was all about. Epic Games' popular spin on the genre seemed like a good place to start, but there was a problem: The game wouldn't download.

My Nintendo Switch said ""an error caused the download to be suspended."" That the ""purchasing Nintendo account could not be used.""

I logged into my Nintendo Account from a web browser and confirmed my worst fear.

Nintendo had banned my account, effectively locking my Switch out of accessing any online service -- including online play, new downloads and even my existing game library. In an instant, I'd lost access to hundreds of dollars worth of digital games. Poof. Gone, with no recourse available to me. The only option Nintendo offered was a ""sign out"" button, effectively showing me the door.

It didn't take me long to figure out what had happened.

Back in April of 2020, 300,000 Nintendo Accounts were compromised in an attack that used old passwords from the defunct Nintendo Network ID account system. Hackers found they could log into vulnerable Nintendo Accounts and make purchases on the eShop using the account's saved payment information. And by logging into Fortnite with a separate account first, the attacker could use the compromised account's credit card to buy themselves vBucks, Fortnite's in-game currency.

This happened to me in May. Back then I immediately got in contact with Nintendo to dispute the $100 charge for Fortnite vBucks, informing them the purchase was unauthorized and that I was getting it refunded through my payment provider. The Nintendo customer service representative seemed fine with that. Nintendo was familiar with the hack and didn't object to having the charge reversed. All was right with the world.

Until, six months later, when Nintendo banned my account without explanation.

I called Nintendo about the unexpected ban. Turned out I hadn't been hacked again, Nintendo had flagged my account for the original hack, half a year after it happened. I explained what happened back in May, but this particular customer service representative wasn't familiar with the attack that compromised 300,000 accounts. In fact, they seemed shocked to learn that a hacker could use a Nintendo Account's saved payment method to steal Fortnite vBucks. They did, however, confirm the ban, and got to work resolving the issue for a second time.

Nintendo asked me to sit tight for a few days while they escalated the case to their finance department. In the meantime, I set out to find out what my Nintendo Switch could still do with a banned account.

The answer: Not much.

Using a Nintendo Switch with a banned Nintendo Account is like living in purgatory. The console presents you with so many possibilities for entertainment, but blocks you at almost every turn. Want to download something from your digital game library? Sorry, your account can't be used.

What about checking your friends list to see what all your buddies with valid accounts are playing? Try it, and the Nintendo Switch asks you to sign-in to a blocked account. Try that, and you'll be told that ""the information you entered is incorrect.""



It's the same story for browsing the eShop, updating games or accessing anything that uses online functionality, including Super Mario 35, the Nintendo Switch Online NES and SNES game libraries and online play in any game. Physical game cards and previously downloaded games are playable, but that's about it. So, it's purgatory, but with Super Mario 3D All-Stars. Could be worse.

The hardest hitting limitation wasn't what the ban did to me, it's what it did to my family. To play Nintendo Switch games online, you need to subscribe to the Nintendo Switch Online service, and multiple Switch consoles can be registered to a single family plan to save money. As the primary account holder of our Nintendo Switch Online Family Membership, my ban effectively cut my entire family group off from online play. My wife couldn't play Animal Crossing with her friends, and my brother's quest to ride Fortnite's battle bus was stymied. Worse still, neither of them knew what was happening or why. Their online play was just… broken, without explanation.

After waiting a day for a solution, I became impatient and called back. This time, Nintendo's customer service agent referred me to a higher tier of support. I knew things were getting serious when the hold music changed from the generic, easy listening of Opus Number One to the soaring, victorious theme of The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time's Hyrule Field.

The second customer service representative listened to my story and quickly resolved the issue, restoring my account to good standing within minutes. Even so, the resolution was slightly unsettling: despite being major news on CNET, CNN and Forbes earlier that year, the agent was completely unaware of the hack that left 300,000 Nintendo Accounts compromised. In fact, Nintendo didn't seem to believe me at all, ending the conversation not with an apology, but a warning: Nintendo will only unban a suspended account once. Next time, I'll be out of luck.

In other words, ""don't let it happen again.""

CNET

Nintendo promised me that if it did happen again, and it was a hack, they'd look at it on a case by case basis, but the way I was informed about this policy felt a little threatening. I may have proof that my account was accessed multiple times out of country before the fraudulent charge occurred, but to Nintendo, it still looks like someone issued a chargeback on a non-refundable purchase. That's against the Nintendo Account user agreement. Even if it takes six months for someone to notice it.



CNET has reached out to Nintendo for official comment and advice on what customers should do if they find themselves in a similar situation. We'll update this piece if we hear back.

Either way, I had my happy ending. At long last my account was restored. My library was accessible again, and my Nintendo Switch Online family plan was active on my account, my wife's account and my brother's account. Finally, I'd be able to introduce him to the concept of a ""Battle Royale"" shooter.

I went back to where my troubles began, and downloaded Fortnite. The game's homescreen loaded, and instantly encouraged me to buy a Battle Pass and load up my account with vBucks.



No thanks. I think I'll pass. On second thought, maybe I'll just build my brother a gaming PC so he can play PUBG.",['Sean Buckley'],https://news.google.com,high
New iPad Pro 2021 leak just revealed Magic Keyboard upgrade,"A newly published design patent reveals that Apple may be set to introduce a 2nd Gen Magic Keyboard for the iPad Pro 2021. It will aim to improve the excellent (but pricey) iPad Pro Magic Keyboard.

This news comes to us from the folks at Patently Apple, which points to five recently granted design patents for Apple's iPad Pro. And while the patents don't look too different, previous rumors give reason to believe there may be new tech under the hood.

If Apple's trying to patent a new Magic Keyboard, there's reason to think it will include new features. There could be a materials change, towards something that attracts less fingerprints or feels more high end (the Magic Keyboard costs up to $329).

Patently Apple notes that ""Apple filed all five design patents under Locarno Classifications 14-01, 02 and 03,"" and then goes onto reveal what each of those classifications refer to.

While 02 and 03 are somewhat boring, ""data processing equipment as well as peripheral apparatus and devices"" and ""telecommunications equipment, wireless remote controls & radio amplifiers,"" respectively, the first patent — if not referring to the a new iPad Pro itself — is intriguing.

Locarno Classification 14-01 is for ""equipment for the recording or reproduction of sounds and pictures"" and a May 2020 report from the site referred to the use of microphones in the keyboard. That report even suggested the microphones could be used for controlling your iPad Pro, so that the device could interpret when your fingers hit the keyboard or your desk.

As is usually the case with patent news, it's hard to say that these works in progress will translate to actual final results. Companies often apply for patents to block rivals from making a similar product, even when they have no intent to make such a device.

We'll keep our eyes glued on upcoming iPad Pro news, as well as any rumored changes to the excellent Magic Keyboard, so stay tuned to find out what happens next.",['Henry T. Casey'],https://news.google.com,high
Animal Crossing Fan Creates Spot-On Pokemon Center Recreation,"✖

Animal Crossing: New Horizons gives players the ability to create really unique designs, and many have used the game's tools to pay homage to other gaming franchises. Instagram user Ollie (@acnh.pokeland) did just that, creating an amazing take on a Pokemon Center! Pokemon Center locations have been a staple of the series since the beginning, but the inclusion of ""Chansey"" behind the counter makes it look most like the one from Pokemon Yellow. That Chansey is actually just a shirt design based on the Pokemon, while the Poke Balls at each end of the counter are actually hat designs! Last but not least, the creator dressed their character in a perfect recreation of Nurse Joy's outfit!

The design can be seen in the Instagram post embedded below.

View this post on Instagram A post shared by 𝗢𝗹𝗹𝗶𝗲 💕 (@acnh.pokeland)

The fact that Ollie was able to so closely replicate the Pokemon Center is really impressive! While previous entries in the Animal Crossing series have included items based on Nintendo franchises, New Horizons has yet to add anything based on any franchise owned (or co-owned in Pokemon's case) by Nintendo. In order to truly capture the look and feel of the Pokemon Center, Ollie had to create things like the Poke Ball hats and the Chansey shirt on their own. Clearly, Animal Crossing: New Horizons has become an impressive spotlight for the creativity of its players!

The @acnh.pokeland Instagram account has several other impressive examples in addition to the Pokemon Center. Ollie has also created a take on the game's Poke Marts, and Professor Oak's lab, as well. All of these designs can be found by clicking on the post embedded above. Ollie is not the only person that has created Pokemon mash-ups in Animal Crossing: New Horizons, however. Shortly after the game's release last year, another fan created an island based on Johto, from Pokemon Gold and Silver. It certainly seems like there must be a significant overlap between the fanbases for these two franchises!

Animal Crossing: New Horizons is available exclusively on Nintendo Switch. You can check out all of our previous coverage of the game right here.

Dr. Dre's LA home target of attempted burglary while he remains hospitalized,"EMBED >More News Videos Rapper and hip-hop mogul Dr. Dre says he's ""doing great and getting excellent care"" after being hospitalized in Los Angeles for a possible brain aneurysm.

BRENTWOOD, LOS ANGELES (KABC) -- While Dr. Dre was in the hospital for a possible brain aneurysm, his home in the Brentwood neighborhood of Los Angeles was the apparent target of a burglary ring Tuesday night, though police say nothing was taken.Authorities initially believed the suspects may have been targeting Vice President-elect Kamala Harris' house in the area. But investigators determined a home owned by Dr. Dre, born Andre Young, was the actual target.Police say the burglars would bang on fences and doors before breaking into homes.

Netflix's Bridgerton is big but George Clooney's The Midnight Sky is bigger,"Netflix

Netflix's Bridgerton is big, The Midnight Sky is bigger, and December was Netflix's biggest one yet -- but neither title could match the popularity of the service's end-of-year megahits that came before.

Both December and the most recent Christmas week were Netflix's biggest yet, by both total hours spent watching and average viewing hours per subscriber. December is typically when Netflix mints some of its biggest viewership numbers of the year -- with its total subscribers expected to have surpassed the 200 million milestone at the end of the year, it's no surprise that last month was its biggest December on record.

But unlike past years, when Netflix had a single title dominate in popularity, none of the biggest shows and movies last month reached the same levels of popularity of the two years that came before.

The Midnight Sky, a sci-fi/drama film directed by and starring George Clooney, is on track to be watched by 72 million accounts, Netflix projected for the first four weeks of release. Bridgerton, a soapy drama set in Regency England from uber-producer Shonda Rhimes, is projected to reach 63 million accounts, and We Can Be Heroes, a family film directed by Robert Rodriquez about the children of superheroes saving their parents (and the planet), is projected to hit 44 million accounts.

But 2019's big December hit, The Witcher series, has them all beat, hitting 76 million accounts in its first four weeks and holding Netflix's record for its most popular series.

And the biggest December hit in 2018, Bird Box, trumps them all -- the postapocalyptic movie starring Sandra Bullock was watched by more than 89 million households in its first month, according to Netflix.

For years, Netflix was notoriously tight-lipped about viewership. The creator of House of Cards, which put Netflix's original content efforts on the map, once said the company wouldn't even share viewership metrics with him. But within the last two years, Netflix has grown much chattier about the popularity of its shows and movies to help recruit talent and stoke buzz.

In addition to sharing viewership stats for top titles every three months as part of its earnings report, Netflix sometimes crows about its viewership numbers while the shows or movies are still freshly released (like now). Netflix also added a top-trending ranking to its service, so people can see what the most popular titles streaming on Netflix in their country are on any given day.

Netflix's popularity figures need disclaimers. For one, they aren't independently verified, nor are they backed up by detailed data from the company. Netflix is in the unique position that it can cherry-pick highlights, and we don't have much independent data to verify them. Traditional media companies, on the other hand, have their box office performance independently monitored, and they're at the mercy of Nielsen ratings as the barometer for TV shows.

Speaking of Nielsen: Don't compare Netflix's numbers to metrics like Nielsen ratings or box office figures. It's tempting to compare how many people watched a Netflix show versus one on regular TV, or to estimate how much money a big movie on Netflix would've made at the box office. But these metrics aren't even close to comparable because the methods behind them differ wildly.

Last year, Netflix switched to a new viewership metric. Netflix now counts a title as ""watched"" if you choose to watch it and let it play for just two minutes. With some shows or movies, you can turn them off before you even hit the main title sequence -- and it still counts as a view.

The following are the latest viewership numbers for Netflix's programs. All the following figures are viewership in a title's first four weeks of release, except in cases when Netflix projected total viewership before the title actually reached the four-week mark (which are noted).

The Midnight Sky -- 72 million accounts.

Bridgerton -- 63 million accounts.



We Can Be Heroes -- 44 million accounts.

Past popularity rankings

So how do those titles stack up against the ones that came before? Netflix's previous viewership stats for past titles are listed below. Again, all the following figures are for the titles' first four weeks of release using the two-minute metric, except for Netflix's projections where noted:

Prior to this year, Netflix counted views differently. Netflix wouldn't start counting something as ""watched"" until you got through 70% of the first episode of a series or of a film's total runtime. Netflix says the new two-minute threshold is more fair to all titles, regardless of their length. But it also means the new stats have inflated viewership numbers by about one-third compared with the old ones.

These are previous viewerships stats under the old rules. They're figures Netflix released (or projected, where noted) for the first four weeks of release.",['Joan E. Solsman'],https://news.google.com,high

Dua Lipa Opened Up About Social Media and Anxiety,"Social media can be stressful, even for those of us with only a handful of followers. For those in the spotlight, it can be absolutely overwhelming — which is why Dua Lipa says she handed over control of her accounts to her managers.

In an interview with British Vogue, the singer said she no longer runs her own social media accounts because it was causing her anxiety.

“I would get anxiety,” Dua Lipa tells British Vogue about scrolling through her feed. “And I was like, ‘This shouldn’t be the way that I’m experiencing this once-in-a-lifetime experience.’ It was messing with my confidence. I’d be super-nervous, wondering what everyone’s gonna say.”

That anxious feeling about how people talked about her on social media was a stark contrast to Dua's early career.

“I would go into interviews and people would say, ‘How do you deal with hate?’And I’m like, ‘Hate? I don’t get hate, what are you talking about?’” she says. ""It was so early on that people didn’t even care to try and say something mean.”

As she got more famous, her social media got more “hectic,” so she handed over control.

In December, Dua also talked about online hate and how it impacted her mental health.

""I experienced a s*** tonne [of bullying] at the end of my first record, and it was definitely something that gave me anxiety and made me upset and made me feel like I wasn’t good enough and made me feel like, maybe I’m not meant to be here and on the stage,” she told Attitude magazine at the time. ""Even after the Grammys, some people were like, ‘Well, she doesn’t deserve it. There were so many things, especially when you start out, like a video of me dancing and they’re like, ‘Ah well, she has no stage presence’ – but they’d never been to one of my shows, they’d never seen me perform.""

Dua's experience is, unfortunately, not unique. Research has shown that people who frequently use social media report higher levels of anxiety and other mental health issues. And, platforms like Instagram can be linked to body insecurity or feelings of FOMO. But Dua's story is also a good reminder that saying mean things about people online is never OK, even if you think they won't see it.

Many celebrities have opened up about the negative impact of social media comments on their mental health, saying that while people often think the celebrity won't see the mean tweets, they do. Last year, Selena Gomez said one of the many reasons she left social media was the onslaught of people dissecting her every move.

Social media can, however, be a force for good. It gives people a voice, helps us stay connected, and links us to crucial mental health resources. In other words, we have the power to make social media a great place for everybody — so let's do it.","['Brittney Mcnamara', 'Brittney Mcnamar']",https://news.google.com,high
Neil Young strikes heart of gold with 50% sale of song catalog to publishing house,"Veteran rock star Neil Young has sold half the rights to his song catalog to Hipgnosis Song Fund SONG, -0.41% , as the U.K. publishing house looks to cash in on the boom in music valuations amid the popularity of streaming services.

Hipgnosis didn’t disclose the value of the deal, which is estimated to have a reported price tag of $150 million, according to Music Business Worldwide.

The deal comes less than a month after Universal Music Publishing Group signed a historic deal to buy Bob Dylan’s entire songwriting catalog, including classics like “Blowin’ in the Wind,” and “The Times They Are A-Changin’” for a reported $300 million. Just days earlier, Fleetwood Mac vocalist and songwriter Stevie Nicks sold an 80% stake in her music to Primary Wave for an estimated $80 million.

Music consumption has been surging thanks to streaming platforms such as Spotify SPOT, +0.17% and Apple Music, which have allowed listeners to rediscover and play some of their favorite tracks of past years. Songwriter catalogs are fetching sale prices 10 to 18 times annual royalties, compared with 8 to 13 times in previous years, according to The Wall Street Journal.

Founded by music industry veteran Merck Mercuriadis, who has previously managed artists including Elton John, Beyoncé and Morrissey, Hipgnosis listed on the London Stock Exchange in 2018 and now commands a market cap of almost $1.3 billion.

The publishing house invests in songs and musical intellectual property rights, and generates revenues by turning music royalties into a steady income stream, making money each time one of its songs is played on the radio or featured in a television advert or film.

“This is a deal that changes Hipgnosis forever,” Mercuriadis said as he announced the deal on Wednesday. “I built Hipgnosis to be a company Neil would want to be a part of. We have a common integrity, ethos and passion born out of a belief in music and these important songs,” he added.

Young, who rose to prominence in the 1960s and 1970s, has released almost 50 studio albums and more than 20 live albums, of which 18 are certified gold, seven are platinum and three are multiplatinum.

In December, Young dropped his lawsuit against U.S. President Donald Trump’s campaign for playing of two of his songs at campaign rallies without permission.

Shares in Hipgnosis, which are already up almost 3% so far this year, were trading 0.28% lower in London on Wednesday.

The publishing house has been on an acquisition spree since September, after it raised £250 million through a share placing to finance further acquisitions.

Earlier this week, the company snapped up 100% of the 161-song catalog of former Fleetwood Mac guitarist Lindsey Buckingham, plus 50% of any as-yet unreleased songs. It also acquired the worldwide producer royalties from 259 songs by Jimmy Iovine, who produced artists including Bruce Springsteen and Patti Smith before founding Beats Electronics, which Apple AAPL, -3.37% bought in 2014 for $3 billion.

Hipgnosis has now spent more than £1 billion acquiring rights in close to 60,000 songs, including those by Blondie, Barry Manilow, and Chrissie Hynde of the Pretenders, among others.",['Lina Saigol'],https://news.google.com,high

Tanya Roberts' death was caused by a UTI: Here's how that can happen,"Bond girl and ""That '70s Show"" star Tanya Roberts died Monday night at age 65 after being hospitalized for a non-COVID-19 related illness, TODAY previously confirmed. On Tuesday, Roberts' longtime partner, Lance O'Brien, told TODAY that she had been hospitalized for a urinary tract infection that spread to her kidneys and gallbladder, which played a role in her death.

Urinary tract infections are the most common type of outpatient infection, with 50-60% of adult women developing at least one in their lifetime, according to recent research published in the journal Therapeutic Advances in Urology. What's much less common, however, is dying from a urinary tract infection, Dr. Kameelah Phillips, an OB-GYN at Calla Women's Health in New York City, told TODAY.

""People don't die from an uncomplicated UTI,"" she explained. ""People die from ... complications of a UTI, which is called sepsis. That's when the bacteria that cause a bladder infection actually spreads into the bloodstream. And when it spreads into the bloodstream, it can cause what we call multisystem organ failure, and that can lead to death.""

How can a UTI lead to sepsis?

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, sepsis is the body's extreme response to an infection. A simple infection can trigger a ""chain reaction"" in the body, and without treatment, sepsis can lead to tissue damage, organ failure and death.

With UTIs in particular, ""the amount of bacteria (can) overwhelm the bladder system, and the bacteria leaves the bladder and enters the blood chain because you have blood vessels that run through your bladder,"" Phillips explained. The amount of bacteria can make this more likely to occur, as can the type of bacteria. Some types are more prone than others to leave the urinary system, Phillips said.

Tanya Roberts died after being hospitalized for a urinary tract infection that spread to her kidneys and gallbladder, her longtime partner told TODAY. Walt Disney Television via Getty Images

UTIs that lead to sepsis, a condition called urosepsis, are more common in older adults, Phillips said.

In part, that can be because older adults may be asymptomatic and go untreated for longer, she explained.

""Older people tend to have less strong immune systems,"" Phillips added, and underlying health conditions. ""(This) can also impact your body's response to treatment ... and make it harder for you to recover from symptoms sometimes,"" she said.

It's ""not very common"" for a UTI to lead to sepsis, according to Phillips.

""Women shouldn't be afraid that their average UTI is going to kill them,"" she stressed. ""(But) it teaches us that we shouldn't ignore UTI symptoms and should go to the doctor. If you think you have symptoms, have your urine checked as opposed to just ignoring it or trying to treat it over the counter.""

It's important to be aware of UTI symptoms, which can include:

Pain or burning while urinating

Frequent urination

Feeling the need to go to the bathroom despite an empty bladder

Bloody urine

Pressure or cramping in the groin

Roberts' rep initially told media outlets that she had died on Sunday night, but news broke on Monday morning that Roberts was still alive. Her rep later confirmed that she died on Monday night.

Roberts was best known for playing Stacey Sutton in the 1985 James Bond film “A View to a Kill” and Midge Pinciotti on “That ’70s Show” between 1998 and 2004.","['Maura Hohman', 'Maura Hohman Is A Weekend Editor For Today.Com.']",https://news.google.com,high
Katie Couric to host ‘Jeopardy!’ after Alex Trebek’s final episodes,"Katie Couric will be one of the first hosts to take the podium after the late Alex Trebek’s final episodes air this week.

The longtime network television powerhouse will guest host the game show for a week, sources told the Los Angeles Times.

Couric did not respond to The Post’s request for comment on the hosting role. But the show has announced plans to have guest hosts lead the show until they find a permanent replacement. Former “Jeopardy!” champ Ken Jennings has been booked for one of the guest-hosting slots.

The news comes as Trebek will appear for the last time on the long-running show on Friday’s episode. The beloved host died in November at 80 after a battle with Stage 4 pancreatic cancer.

On Monday night’s episode, Trebek delivered a powerful message about togetherness and giving.

“You’ll recall that about a month ago, I asked all of you to take a moment to give thanks for all of the blessings that you enjoy in your lives,” he said. “Now, today, a different kind of message. This is the season of giving. I know you want to be generous with your family, your friends, your loved ones.”

He continued on with a challenge for fans who have watched the show he hosted for more than 8,200 episodes.

“But today, I’d like you to go one step further. I’d like you to open up your hands and open up your hearts to those who are still suffering because of COVID-19. People who are suffering through no fault of their own,” he said. “We’re trying to build a gentler, kinder society, and if we all pitch in — just a little bit — we’re gonna get there.”

The episode, which was filmed in October, ended with a dedication to Trebek reading: “Forever in our hearts, always our inspiration.”

His final episode will include “a special tribute to the life and work of the man who captained America’s Favorite Quiz Show with skill, style, and sophistication for 36+ years,” according to a statement from “Jeopardy!” producer Sony Pictures Television. The last week of episodes was scheduled to air during the week of Christmas, but Sony pushed them back so fans could enjoy their final moments with Trebek.

Couric, 63, anchored NBC’s “Today” from 1991 through 2006, then moved on to anchor “CBS Evening News” and start her own media company. She also became a fierce advocate for cancer screenings and research, having lost both her first husband and her sister to cancer.",['January'],https://news.google.com,high

"No matter the explanation, Goldberg’s Raw promo didn’t make any damn sense","Word on the sheets is the reason Goldberg’s show-closing promo from this week’s Raw referred to comments Drew McIntyre hadn’t made was due to a timing issue that prevented the WWE champion from being able to make them.

Producing live television is hard, and stuff happens. Problem is, even if McIntyre had said some things about the Legends on hand for Legends Night so Goldberg could say he didn’t believe he meant them, it would still be illogical, and untrue to what makes Bill an attraction.

As many have pointed out, if Goldberg was concerned about active wrestlers disrespecting Legends, there was another guy who spent the entire night doing it. Randy Orton not only walked around backstage on Monday insulting Ric Flair, Big Show and Mark Henry, for decades he’s been known as the Legend Killer. I guess killing is more respectful than... whatever it is Bill thinks Drew was doing?

We also watched McIntyre stand up for the veterans repeatedly during his feud with Orton last year.

The explanation the promo the champ was supposed to cut before Goldberg came would have provided, I guess, is that the Hall of Famer’s speech was supposed to throw McIntyre off his game. Drew holds those that came before him in such high regard that having a Legend question his sincerity would be devastating. That was the big Scot’s theory/save during Jan. 4’s closing segment.

But why though?

Must be because everyone associates Goldberg feuds with how he uses his mic skills to twist his opponent’s minds, leading to intricate psychological warfare between him and his rivals. Oh wait, NO ONE WANTS THAT FROM A GOLDBERG PROGRAM.

He may be a 54 year old who almost broke Undertaker’s neck while concussed on a propaganda cash grab for a despotic regime, but Goldberg still has appeal. That appeal remains pretty simple, though: “You’re next!”, spear, jackhammer, repeat.

Monday’s scene gets there, too! There wouldn’t have been any timing issues with the episode if he just comes out, points at the belt with “me want” in his eyes. Drew says “maybe in your prime, old man, but not now,” Goldberg shoves him down, they smash their heads together and circle like a couple of bulls as the show goes off the air. Easy peasy.

There would still be complaints, but folks who don’t want to see a Goldberg title match in 2021 (a group of fans I count myself among) aren’t likely to be swayed no matter what. Trying to justify his request just complicates things without changing anyone’s mind. I’d be interested in seeing an in-depth character arc about the aging former headliner trying new tricks in a desperate bid to prove he can still hang at the top of the card, but it’s not like WWE is going to pull that off in a month.

Book the thing, see if his mystique brings back some old fans or entices some new ones, and hope the match doesn’t suck.

Fingers crossed Bill only has one more date in his contract for this feud, and WWE scripts that to go more like the first and last 30 seconds of this one without the two minutes in between.

Then we can start worrying about the outcome of Royal Rumble’s WWE title match...","['Sean Rueter', 'Jan']",https://news.google.com,high
Philadelphia Eagles' Jason Kelce: No confrontation over switch to Nate Sudfeld,"EMBED >More News Videos It was an emotional moment for Eagles TE Zach Ertz during a press conference on Monday following the team's loss to the Washington Football Team.

PHILADELPHIA -- Eagles center Jason Kelce acknowledged he was a ""little surprised"" by the decision to pull quarterback Jalen Hurts in favor of Nate Sudfeld in the fourth quarter of Sunday's game against Washington and that he approached coach Doug Pederson about the move but said the discussion was nonconfrontational.""I went up to Doug and asked him if he was taking Hurts out, he said, 'Yes, I think Nate's earned the right to play,'"" Kelce wrote in an Instagram post Wednesday. ""I said, 'Everyone else is staying in?' He said, 'Absolutely.'""""At no point was anything from me or anyone else confrontational,"" Kelce added. ""We all knew leading into the game that Sudfeld was told to be ready to play, and that Doug wanted to see what he could do in a game situation. All of us during the week leading up were excited for Nate, a guy that has been with us for 4 years to get an opportunity in a real game to show the world what he can do. We all have complete confidence in Nate as a player, there's a reason he's been here this long, and a reason the team brought him back. And that's because we feel like Nate is a guy we can win with.""The conversation Kelce addresses appears to be his response to a Philadelphia Inquirer report that players were ""shocked and outraged"" by Pederson's decision to go to Sudfeld.What surprised Kelce, and other players on the team, was the timing. The Eagles were down three points when Sudfeld replaced Hurts early in the fourth quarter, and the next two possessions resulted in turnovers.Though the game had no playoff implications for the Eagles, the competitive juices were flowing -- even for players who were unable to participate.""If I'm being honest, nobody liked the decision. Nobody. That's all I can say,"" running back Miles Sanders, one of nine Eagles players ruled out with injuries for the game, told 94.1 WIP on Tuesday. ""I don't know who was the main person behind that decision, but all I know is a lot of people on the team were confused.""Defensive end Brandon Graham thinks the confusion was created by circumstance. Due to the NFL's COVID-19 protocols, injured players aren't allowed on the sideline and didn't hear when Pederson told the team that some players who don't normally get an opportunity should be prepared to play.The move from Hurts to Sudfeld in a contested game that decided the winner of the NFC East sparked reaction throughout the league, including from New York Giants coach Joe Judge, who strongly suggested Philadelphia's actions were disrespectful to the game. The Giants would have claimed the NFC East title with an Eagles win over Washington.Graham put the onus back on the Giants, suggesting they should have handled their own business instead of relying on a Washington loss to to stamp their ticket to the playoffs.""Some people just didn't like the decision because they want to see Hurts in there, but at the end of the day, this game didn't mean anything for us. We were still going home, so why not see who else you got out there?"" Graham told 94.1 WIP on Wednesday. ""And if people have a problem with it, don't put yourself in that position, the Giants. Don't put yourself in that position, win your game.""With the loss, the Eagles secured the sixth overall pick in April's NFL draft. A win against Washington would have moved them to ninth overall.",[],https://news.google.com,high

Now, Chicago will head to New Orleans to take on the Saints in the second-to-last game of the newly-expanded NFL Wild Card schedule on Sunday. The Saints are 10-point favorites in the Wild Card Round NFL odds from William Hill Sportsbook.

Meanwhile, Derrick Henry wore out opponents late in the season with 1,081 yards in the final seven games to help the Titans win the AFC South at 11-5.

Now, it has examined the latest 2021 Wild Card Round NFL odds and NFL betting lines from William Hill, simulated every snap, and its predictions are in. Head to SportsLine now to see them all.

Top NFL predictions for the 2021 Wild Card Round

One of the top Wild Card Round NFL picks the model recommends: The Steelers (-6) cover against the Browns. The Steelers began the season with 11 consecutive victories before floundering late and finishing at 12-4. However, a Week 16 win over the Colts helped them lock up the AFC North and rest several of their starters in Week 17 against the Browns.

Even without Ben Roethlisberger and T.J. Watt in the lineup, the Steelers outgained the Browns 394-358 and gave Cleveland a serious scare with a late JuJu Smith-Schuster touchdown grab. The Browns ultimately prevailed, but Pittsburgh beat Cleveland 38-7 at home in Week 6 at full strength.

Additionally, Browns head coach Kevin Stefanski has tested positive for COVID-19, while Pro Bowl guard Joel Bitonio is also out because of coronavirus. The model says the Steelers will force a pair of turnovers and cover in nearly 60 percent of simulations. The under (47.5) also hits 60 percent of the time.

Another one of the top Wild Card Weekend NFL predictions from the model: The Ravens (-3) cover against the Titans. Baltimore's offense rolled late in the season, scoring 37.2 points per game over the last five weeks. That leads to a tough matchup for a Tennessee squad that finished the regular season 28th in total defense (398.3 yards per game).

SportsLine's model projects that Titans running back Derrick Henry will rush for well over 100 yards, but Tennessee is only able to score 23 points. Lamar Jackson throws for 200 yards and adds almost 70 more on the ground. Baltimore covers over 50 percent of the time, while the under (55) hits in 60 percent of simulations.

Clemson's Trevor Lawrence announces plans to declare for 2021 NFL Draft,"Clemson quarterback Trevor Lawrence ended months of speculation regarding his future when he released a video on Wednesday officially announcing his decision to enter the 2021 NFL Draft later this year.

The college junior shared a video on Twitter officially announcing an end to his time with the Clemson Tigers to declare for the draft after his college career came to a heartbreaking end with a loss against Ohio State in the Sugar Bowl on New Year's Day.

ALABAMA’S DEVONTA SMITH WINS 2020 HEISMAN TROPHY

""I really feel like I'm a man now and I'm ready to take on those challenges,"" Lawrence said in the announcement. ""Super excited for life ahead. I'm grateful for Clemson and I'm going to miss it.""

The initial plan going into this season was to finish out his college career as a junior and declare for the draft, but the 6-foot-6, long-haired quarterback appeared to quickly pump the brakes on that as the then-winless New York Jets became the favorite for the No. 1 overall pick.

As the Jets' luck began to turn around -- luck depending on whom you ask--the Jacksonville Jaguars solidified the No. 1 pick by finishing with a 15-1 record. Lawrence would declare shortly after.

""Looking back on it, I hope my legacy at Clemson is that I was a great teammate and a great person overall. Just more than football, more than how I played each game, just how I treated people,"" Lawrence said in his announcement.

""I want that to be the main thing I’m known for and I feel like for over the last three years thats the thing I kept as a priority, just treating people well and being a good person. So I hope that’s my legacy when I leave here.""

Born in Knoxville, Tenn., Lawrence attended high school in Georgia, where he played football before committing to Clemson in 2016 as a five-star recruit.

It took four games as a freshman in 2018 before he became the starting quarterback and never surrendered the position — except for two games this season he missed after testing positive for COVID-19.

Lawrence led the Tigers to the national title in 2018, dismantling powerhouse Alabama 44-16 as he threw for 347 yards and three touchdowns to complete a 15-0 season. He attempted to win back-to-back titles the following season but lost 42-25 to LSU.

""I’ve learned a lot about myself about who I want to be, just all those things,"" Lawrence continued.

Lawrence finished with 10,098 yards passing with 90 touchdowns and 17 interceptions. This year, he completed a career best 69.1 percent of his throws on the way to winning ACC player of the year.

Who the Bills protected on their practice squad for Wild Card round,"The Bills announced their Wild Card week players the team has placed on the protected portion of their practice squad via the NFL’s transaction wire on Tuesday ahead of their game with the Indianapolis Colts (11-5).

For the past few weeks, the Bills have made one spot on their practice squad interchangeable while the other three remained the same. That was the case once again this week, however, it’s pretty obviously why that new player was selected this week. Recent free agent signee in wide receiver Kenny Stills replaces undrafted rookie offensive lineman Trey Adams in that spot.

The full group of four including the three that remained are:

As mentioned, Stills was recently signed by the Bills and was probably coveted by other teams. With the new NFL rules that allow teams to recall players from their practice squad in the postseason as much as they want, other teams can still attempt to sign them. That hasn’t changed.

Because of that, protecting Stills makes more sense than anyone else that was previously being protected. Stills also likely has a chance to be used in Buffalo’s Wild Card round against the Colts.

"Despite the early success, Elfrid Payton doesn’t fit with the Knicks","At the beginning of the season, I called for Julius Randle to be bought out if he was not yet traded. Along with many other Knicks fans, I’d had more than enough after a season of watching him spinning into triple coverage. At the time, I thought, even with a presumed bounce back to Randle’s New Orleans play under a competent coach, it wouldn’t be worth it due to the negative effect on spacing and development. Randle made myself and many others look foolish through the first seven games of the season, exceeding even the most optimistic projections by far.

Elfrid Payton, the other perceived stopgap on the roster, has not. After an underwhelming start to the season with 7 points on 3-13 shooting through two games, he’s picked it up over the following five, averaging 18 PPG, 5 RPG, and 5 APG, on 50 FG% and 50 3P% as the Knicks went 4-1. So, why am I not singing his praises as well? Unfortunately for Elfrid, his impact game is measured outside those stats.

If you peer behind those percentages, it becomes clear that Payton is still not an efficient player. Unlike Randle, one of the most efficient scorers in the league in New Orleans and Los Angeles, Payton never came close to league-average efficiency throughout his career. Payton’s 50 FG% might not look all that bad if he were doing more than shooting two-pointers at an average rate.

The main issue with Payton is his reluctance to draw contact or attempt three-pointers. His hesitancy in these areas leaves him hovering around 50 TS%, which falls three percent below the league average. Even with this recent hot streak, Payton is shooting 50% from behind the arc on just ten attempts over the 5-game stretch, seven of those three point attempts coming in the first two games.

His hesitancy in these areas of his game leaves him hovering around 50TS%, which falls three percent below the league average. Even with this recent hot streak, Payton is shooting 50% from behind the arc on just ten attempts over the 5-game stretch, seven of those threes coming in the first two games. From the foul line, Payton has a career 62 FT%, and just 56% with the Knicks. During this recent stretch, he averaged 2.2 free throw attempts per game, close to his career average of 2.4 — not an ideal mark for a point guard who doesn’t contribute much in other areas. For comparison, point guard Immanuel Quickley, who certainly has a propensity for drawing fouls, has seen as many free throw attempts as Payton in only one-fourth the minutes. As a result of his foul-drawing and shooting, the inexperienced Quickley has a true shooting percentage of 80%.

Despite these poor numbers, Payton is third on the team in field goal attempts.

There are still more reasons why Payton just doesn’t fit in with the rebuilding Knicks. The organization has been quiet about its plans, instead choosing to let hard work and results do the talking. We know Head Coach Tom Thibodeau has five core values at the center of his mission for the young Knicks. Coach said, “the foundation will be the defense, the rebounding, low turnovers, and sharing the ball. Offensively, obviously, you’re trying to get as many easy baskets as you can. You’re also trying to get to the free-throw line, and you’re trying to create as many corner 3s as possible”, and on the defensive end, “obviously, you try to take those things away and get your opponent to take long twos.”

We know Thibodeau wants his team to play fast and use their youth and athleticism. After the key signings of Kenny Payne and Johnnie Bryant this past summer, it’s clear that player development is an important tenet for this organization.

The Knicks impressed in a few of these categories so far — they’re ninth in rebound percentage and defensive rating, 13th and 10th in left and right corner three attempts, 12th in assist percentage, and 14th in free throw rate. However, there is room for improvement, and a lot can be aided by simply taking Elfrid out of the equation.

Despite his best skill being distribution, Payton is, at his core, a very ball-dominant player. Last season as a starter under Mike Miller, Payton led Knicks in time of possession at 6.6 minutes per game, the 12th-highest mark in the league just behind LeBron James, Chris Paul, Russell Westbrook, Donovan Mitchell, and Kyrie Irving. Over that span, the next highest on the team was Dennis Smith Jr. and Frank Ntilikina at 3.5. While the Knicks were better offensively with Payton on the court, that is a lot of time for one player to hold the ball while still yielding negative results. The key problem? A player holding the ball that much means another budding player in New York doesn’t have it in his hands, and RJ Barrett has shown he’s most effective when he has the ball.

While Randle took on more responsibility this season (3.1 time of possession last season to 4.7 for this season), Payton has still been very ball-dominant. Although he plays under 30 minutes per game, Payton is 16th in time of possession, tied with max players Kyrie Irving, Russell Westbrook, and Jayson Tatum. The starting point guard is also 11th in seconds per touch at 5.24, a mark that nearly rivals James Harden, who falls at 5.33. Additionally, Payton sits at sixth in the league for dribbles per touch, above Harden and Lillard. What does all this ball dominance yield? Just 0.224 points per touch. The Knicks still rank 24th in offensive rating, and while the team does rank 3.1 points better with Payton offensively, there is room to smooth out the offense.

One of the points of emphasis for the Knicks this season has been attempting more three-pointers — corner threes specifically. Despite ranking higher in corner threes, the team is just 30th in threes attempted. With Payton’s lack of shooting ability, you would assume he could create shooting looks off penetration. However, Payton only created 4.2 3-point field goal attempts per game. Payton assisted on just eight three-pointers in seven games, just two coming from the corner, only one coming off penetration. Randle created a whopping 10.6, and with Randle realizing Fizdale’s dream of being a proficient point forward, there is not much room to have another ball-dominant non-shooter alongside him and RJ Barrett. In Payton’s defense, the only true shooter to kick out to is Reggie Bullock most of the time, who has shot just 33% from distance over the past two seasons.

On the other hand, Austin Rivers and Immanuel Quickley create 4.7 and 2.3 looks from the three-point range, respectively. Against Atlanta, we saw a clear difference in three-point creation — the Knicks had shot just 1-10 from three with Payton at the mantle for most of the game. Once Quickley and Rivers checked in, the team made 6-of-11 three-point attempts in the final 15 minutes. While that level of shooting may not be sustainable, the pair makes the offense much more dynamic with both the threat of their three-point shot and how they get other shooters involved. They both can get into the paint with relative ease and look to make the best possible play for the team. Quickley’s ability to draw fouls is the exact trait Thibodeau valued in Jimmy Butler and a skill that Payton doesn’t possess. In a small sample, we’ve seen some of Knox’s best play from working alongside Quickley and Rivers as they actively look to feed him the ball in the corner. Alec Burks, who hasn’t gotten to play much yet, was incredibly efficient when he shared the floor with them, putting up 62 points in 83 minutes while making 10 of 15 threes. Despite being a shooting guard, he looks to get others involved and is averaging 2.9 assists to 1.4 turnovers going back to last year. It’s hard to make a case that you need Elfrid Payton when you have so many other willing shooting and passing guards working around Randle as the fulcrum.

The ball just moves better without Payton in the game. As Tom Piccolo pointed out for Daily Knicks, the Knicks assisted on 77% of their shots with Quickley, as opposed to just 50% with Payton. Payton is averaging a mere 0.1 secondary assists per game, a lackluster number for someone who holds the ball so much. Randle and Barrett have a mark of 0.6 and 0.3. Here’s another good clip from Piccolo showing incredible ball movement, which does not exist with Payton, even with Randle’s newfound elite passing ability.

Another Thibodeau point of emphasis is pushing the pace, though the Knicks have been underwhelming in this category. The team ranks 30th in points off turnovers, 30th in fast break points, and 26th in pace. Ultimately, this boils down to the point guard play. Payton rarely looks to push the ball in transition, unlike we’ve seen from the other young Knicks.

WHAT AN OUTLET by Obi to RJ for the transition slam! Love to see this. pic.twitter.com/kkiZVnjvcw — The Knicks Wall (@TheKnicksWall) December 24, 2020

Rarely does Payton look to speed up the offense, even off a turnover, and you’ll never see him pick up the pace off a miss, which likely contributes to such a high time of possession and dribble account, another reason why the Knicks rank so low in these categories.

With Payton as the floor general, Barrett and Robinson’s scoring efficiencies haven’t seen much improvement from last year. This stagnation can’t fall completely on Payton, but constructively, three non-shooting, ball-dominant players sharing the floor is a problem. While Barrett isn’t a better passer or much more efficient than Payton at the moment, his development is crucial and should be a priority. Sharing the floor with Payton is not helping Barrett, especially when Payton contributes to the bad spacing with weird cuts, such as this one that cramped up the lane.

If Payton slows down the offense, keeps the ball from Barrett, and doesn’t space the floor, then there is not much upside to having him run the offense. The issue is, Payton does not bring much on the defensive end either.

Here are some from the last five games. Coulda been more but only a 2 minute limit on twitter. He dies on every screen https://t.co/y9fyOaclxu pic.twitter.com/CNeOUgcoj2 — Bootum (@DaRealBootum) February 11, 2020

While he’s no sieve, Payton is a bit worse than his reputation would lend you to believe. His teams have never defensively performed better with him on the court since the 16-17 season by a marginal mark of 0.7 points per 100 better. This year the Knicks have been 11 points per 100 worse with him defensively. In their last game against the Indiana Pacers, Malcolm Brogdon scored 25 of his 33 against Elf, including 5-7 on three-pointers. Payton tends to die on screens, and this game was no exception. Brogdon routinely torched him without much of a fight from Payton.

When you have a guard with so many shortcomings on both ends of the floor, there isn’t a reason to prioritize his playing time over the defensive-minded Frank Ntilikina either, who is still 22 and coming off a solid year as a backup point guard. While Ntilikina no doubt has his offensive struggles, also being shy of initiating contact at times despite being a good free-throw shooter, the Knicks were still better with him offensively on the floor than off last season. So far this season, Ntilikina’s shot looks improved, and there is no reason to stop seeing if he can keep it up instead of going with Payton.

The very slight improvement on offense with Elfrid Payton is not worth passing up the chance of developing a solid backup point guard. With a threat of a three-point shot and pull-up jumper, Ntilikina can help the Knicks space the floor and is already more dynamic than Payton on offense.

Ultimately, the Knicks are eight points worse with Elfrid Payton on the floor, Reggie Bullock being the only other rotation player with a lower mark. While that number may overestimate Payton’s faults, I think it’s safe to say the Knicks could afford to sit him and give other guys looks.

In a small sample size, Quickley leads the team in on/off at plus-26, Burks in second at plus-17.4, Rivers in fourth at plus-5.6, and Frank with his fourth straight year holding a positive mark. While these numbers may not last, it has been three years of looking at Elfrid Payton and Julius Randle going back to New Orleans, and they had a negative net rating and record then as well. Randle earned a prominent role so far, but there is nothing beneficial that Elfrid brings to the table at this point. Once everyone is healthy, it’s time to give the keys to Immanuel Quickley, Austin Rivers, Frank Ntilikina, and Alec Burks. These guards will likely complement Randle and the supporting pieces better as well. Let the kids run the show — they’re ready for it.",['Jan'],https://news.google.com,high
Jets kick off coaching interviews with Chiefs’ Eric Bieniemy,"The Jets announced Wednesday they have completed their interview with Chiefs offensive coordinator Eric Bieniemy for their head coach opening.

Bieniemy is the first person known to have interviewed for the job. The Chiefs are the No. 1 seed in the AFC playoffs and have a bye this weekend, allowing Bieniemy to interview this week. Other candidates whose teams play this weekend must wait until after their games to interview.

This is the second time the Jets have interviewed Bieniemy. The Jets interviewed him in 2019 before hiring Adam Gase, who was fired Sunday after two seasons with the team.

The 51-year-old Bieniemy has been the offensive coordinator in Kansas City for three seasons. The Chiefs finished with the No. 1 offense in the NFL this year. The biggest question about Bieniemy is how much credit he deserves for the Chiefs’ success and how much is due to head coach Andy Reid and quarterback Patrick Mahomes. It is unclear how much say Bieniemy has in play-calling with Reid handing those duties primarily.

The first round of interviews are all being conducted virtually. The Jets likely will bring a few coaches to Florham Park for a second interview later in the process. The Jets are also known to have requested interviews with Colts defensive coordinator Matt Eberflus, Titans offensive coordinator Arthur Smith, Bills offensive coordinator Brian Daboll and Rams defensive coordinator Brandon Staley. All of them are part of playoff teams with games this weekend so their interviews will not happen until next week.",['January'],https://news.google.com,high
"With Joe Ellis leaving after 2021, what happens to the Denver Broncos franchise?","In a sit-down interview with 9News on Tuesday, Joe Ellis announced that he won’t be seeking any kind of extension after his contract is up. His current contract, like John Elway’s, runs through March of 2022. That means both Elway and Ellis could be done in Denver after this next season.

“I don’t envision extending it past that other than maybe just an interim period of some sort if necessary,’’ Ellis said in a sit-down interview with 9NEWS on Tuesday. “But that would be dedicated to finding a replacement as a club president or CEO, depending on what the next owner – whether that’s Brittany or somebody else — where that ends up.”

Mike Klis broke down the entire situation rather well in the post linked above and is well worth the read.

The implications of this news could be huge for the future for the franchise. With the legal battle between the Bowlen children ongoing and, as of now, unresolved, a sale is far more likely than a resolution in my opinion.

With Ellis bowing out this early, I think that could also signal he thinks a sale is almost certain. If the transfer of power was going to Brittany Bowlen, then he would likely need to stick around for a while to assist in her takeover of the day-to-day of running the franchise.

As a fan, I think this is actually a good thing. I don’t believe any of the Bowlen children have shown the passion and love of football that Pat Bowlen had and they likely wouldn’t value the winning culture and desire to compete for championships as highly as Pat did. A new owner could infuse new blood and ideas into the organization that could help it break free from this five year rut it has been in since winning Super Bowl 50.

The other caveat here is the immediate implications of the Broncos general manager search. If I came away feeling like a sale is likely, then why would any highly sought after type of general manager talent want this job knowing there could be new ownership in place as early as this year?

"LSU Tigers hire Jake Peetz, who worked under Joe Brady, as new offensive coordinator","LSU is going back to the Joe Brady system to try to fix its ailing offense. The Tigers hired Carolina Panthers quarterbacks coach Jake Peetz as their new offensive coordinator Wednesday.

Hold That Tiger



Jake Peetz joins the staff as our new offensive coordinator! #GeauxTigers pic.twitter.com/02QwL9RLIR — LSU Football (@LSUfootball) January 6, 2021

Peetz spent this past season working under Brady, Carolina's offensive coordinator, who helped guide LSU to a 2019 CFP national championship in his only season with the Tigers. With Brady and Steve Ensminger working as co-offensive coordinators in 2019, the Tigers went undefeated and finished as the top-rated offense in the FBS, averaging 568.5 yards and 48.4 points per game.

This past season, after Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback Joe Burrow turned pro and Brady left for the NFL, the Tigers finished 35th in total offense (433.9 yards) and 39th in scoring (32 points). Ensminger was reassigned, and passing-game coordinator Scott Linehan was fired.

LSU head coach Ed Orgeron has targeted Cincinnati defensive coordinator Marcus Freeman as the top candidate to replace former defensive coordinator Bo Pelini, who was fired after only one season back at LSU.

The Tigers ranked 124th in the FBS in total defense (492 yards), 97th in scoring defense (34.9 points) and dead last in pass defense (323 yards) in 2020.

Freeman, a finalist for the Broyles Award for the top FBS assistant, guided a Bearcats unit that ranked in the top 15 in total defense (324.6 yards), scoring (16.8 points) and run defense (111.1 yards). Freeman is scheduled to interview at LSU this week, sources told ESPN.

LSU also is hiring Panthers coaching assistant DJ Mangas to replace Linehan. Mangas, 31, worked with Brady this past season and was an offensive analyst at LSU in 2019. Before that, he was the second-youngest offensive coordinator in Division I at William & Mary.

""Both Jake and DJ come highly recommended from one of the premier and innovative offensive coaches in the game in Joe Brady,"" Orgeron said in a statement. ""Jake brings 10 years of NFL experience with him to our staff. He spent a season coaching alongside and learning from Joe [Brady] so we couldn't be more excited about Jake joining our staff. His knowledge of football combined with the players we have on our roster, will make for a dynamic offense for LSU in 2021.""

Peetz, 37, coached Carolina's running backs in 2019, working with Christian McCaffrey, who became the third player in NFL history with 1,000 yards rushing and receiving in the same season. The former Nebraska defensive back also coached quarterbacks for the Las Vegas Raiders and Jacksonville Jaguars, and running backs with the Washington Football Team. He also was an analyst at Alabama in 2013 and 2018.","['Mark Schlabach', 'David Hale', 'Adam Rittenberg', 'Harry Lyles', 'Harry Lyles Jr.', 'Alex Scarborough', 'David M.

Manchester City: Was the 3-1 win over Chelsea a short-term blueprint to add some impetus to the surprisingly stilted attacking play of City so far this season? With Kevin De Bruyne operating as something akin to a playmaking target man in the center forward's role Guardiola's side were at their freewheeling best with Phil Foden, Raheem Sterling and Bernardo Silva flitting menacingly in support of the Belgian.

With so many of City's squad being missing due to COVID-19 (only Gabriel Jesus and Kyle Walker will have completed the mandatory 10-day isolation period by Wednesday and must still produce a negative test) there seems to be strong reason to assume that Guardiola might repeat the plan that worked so spectacularly at Stamford Bridge.

Prediction

Both sides arrive at this semifinal in a rich vein of form, though if their last meeting is anything to go by one ought not to expect too many fireworks.

Quarterback Bailey Hockman to transfer from NC State :: WRALSportsFan.com,"Quarterback Bailey Hockman, who helped NC State win eight games this season, announced his intention to transfer on Wednesday.

Hockman, a fourth-year junior, threw for 2,088 yards with 13 touchdowns and 11 interceptions and started nine games for the Wolfpack in 2020.

He posted the announcement on his Twitter account on Wednesday.

With the expected return of Devin Leary and the addition of four-star recruit Aaron McLaughlin, Hockman’s decision was not unexpected but doesn’t diminish Hockman’s role in the Wolfpack’s turn-around season in 2020.

""Love Bailey and appreciate everything he has done for our program,"" NC State coach Dave Doeren wrote in a text message to WRAL. ""He stepped up this year big time. He wants to be a starter next year and we know with Devin coming back that is a tough spot for him.""

NC State went 4-8 in 2019, when Hockman was one of three different starting quarterbacks, but bounced back to 8-4 this season with Hockman as the starter for nine of the 12 games.

Leary went into training camp in August as the starter but then missed three weeks of practice due to COVID-19 protocols. Hockman ended up starting the opener and leading the Wolfpack to a 45-42 win over Wake Forest.

Hockman started, and struggled, the next week in a 45-24 loss to Virginia Tech and was replaced by Leary in the second half.

Leary started the next three games, leading the Wolfpack to wins in each start, before he broke his left leg in the second half of a 31-20 win over Duke on Oct. 17.

Hockman finished the Duke game and then started the next week in a 48-21 loss at UNC. He was benched in the second quarter for freshman quarterback Ben Finley but after three turnovers by Finley, Hockman was brought back in to finish the game.

Hockman found his footing after the shaky performance against the Tar Heels. He helped the Wolfpack win its final four regular season games and had seven touchdowns and three interceptions in those four wins.

He struggled in the Gator Bowl loss to Kentucky on Jan. 2 with three interceptions.

In all, Hockman was there when coach Dave Doeren needed him and for the most part delivered in a difficult role.

Hockman began his career at Florida State in 2017 and then transferred to a junior college before he enrolled at NC State in 2019.

The lefty from Powder Springs, Ga. started three games in 2019 but eventually lost the job to Leary.

How long before Earth's core runs out of fuel?,"Yellowstone volcano: Expert reveals size of magma chamber

CDC reports severe allergic reactions from COVID-19 vaccinations rare,"Of nearly 2 million people who were vaccinated against COVID-19 during a 10-day period in December, only 21 people experienced severe allergic reactions, officials with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said Wednesday.

Most of those people had a history of allergies or allergic reactions, and for the 20 people the CDC followed up with, all had recovered and been sent home.

Nancy Messonnier, director of the CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, stressed allergic reactions are an “exceedingly rare” occurrence.

“Of course, we all would hope that any vaccine would have zero adverse events, but even at 11 cases per million doses administered, it's a very safe vaccine,” she said.

The risks of becoming seriously ill from COVID-19 are much higher, Messonnier said, with more than 2,000 people dying per day.

“The risk from COVID and poor outcomes from COVID is still more than the risk of a severe outcome from the vaccine,” she said.

A report published Wednesday by the CDC found 21 allergic reactions among 1.9 million people who were vaccinated with the Pfizer vaccine between Dec. 14 and 23.

An additional eight reports of severe allergic reactions were reported after that time period and weren’t included in the report. More reports will be released in the future.

The Pfizer vaccine was the only one being administered to the public during that time period, but because of its similarity to the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine, the CDC recommends that patients with histories of immediate and severe allergic reactions to vaccines or anaphylaxis be monitored for 30 minutes after injections.

People with histories of allergic reactions to food, insect stings, vaccines or a history of anaphylaxis should consult with their doctors before being vaccinated, Messonnier said.",[],https://news.google.com,high

David Liu of the Broad Institute therefore had no plans to present such findings, which he’d peeked at over his graduate student’s shoulder, when he gave a high-profile talk in 2018 at the National Institutes of Health on a form of the CRISPR genome-editing system that he’d invented.

Not that he wasn’t tempted. Student Luke Koblan had used the clever new form of CRISPR, called base editing, to alter a single misspelled pair of “letters” among the 3 billion in the DNA of cells taken from children with progeria, an infamous and fatal genetic disease marked by accelerated aging. Koblan had done this work in lab dishes, and had also corrected the progeria mutation in a mouse carrying the human gene that, as a result, aged so quickly that by toddlerhood, it was like a picture of Dorian Gray with whiskers.

Chatting before his talk with NIH Director Francis Collins, who discovered the progeria mutation in 2003, Liu happened to mention the results. Collins was blown away. You have to put that in your talk, Collins said. When the head of the NIH speaks, biologists listen — and in Liu’s case, run to the men’s room to update his talk with how a CRISPR base editor might just be the long-sought cure to progeria. Not a treatment, like the drug lonafarnib that was approved this past November, but a one-and-done cure.

Liu’s talk led to a collaboration with Collins, the CRISPR base-editing of 62 mice with progeria, and, on Wednesday, the announcement that the study produced “results so much better than anything we ever tried,” Collins said. The base editor was so good at repairing the mice’s progeria that half the animals lived 510 days — old age for mice, and twice as long as untreated mice.

With such stunning results, “this could become a therapy for [progeria] and perhaps other rare accelerated-aging syndromes,” said Wilbert Vermeij of the Oncode Institute in the Netherlands, an expert on the biology of aging who was not involved in the study.

If the mouse results are confirmed in human trials, “this has the feel of something that could be a true genetic cure with a single injection,” not a drug children have to take all their lives, said Dr. Leslie Gordon, a physician who founded the Progeria Research Foundation after her son, Sam Berns, was diagnosed with the disease. (He died in 2014 at age 17).

There are only about 200 children with progeria worldwide. Although they seem healthy as babies, by age 1 or 2 they are failing to grow, losing the fat under their skin, and developing vascular and other problems characteristic of 80-year-olds. They typically die around age 14 of stroke, cardiovascular disease, and other illnesses of old age. Cognitively normal, they know exactly what is happening to them.

The cause of progeria is a single T-A base pair in the DNA where a C-G should be. The resulting mutant protein, called progerin, is poisonous to cells.

Base editors are made for such a mutation: They convert one DNA letter into a different one, in this case the mutant T-A to the healthy C-G. And they do so without chopping up the double helix, as standard CRISPR does, which risks mangling genes.

The scientists first slipped a T-to-C base editor into cells donated by children with progeria, using a lentivirus to carry the genome editor into the cells; 90% of the cells had their DNA corrected. “We were really surprised we were getting such significant correction at a disease-causing site,” Liu said. The cells began producing healthy protein, called lamin A, and very little poisonous progerin, they reported in Nature.

Cells in lab dishes are all well and good, but Liu knew he had to test the system on mice — way more of them than the lone animal in Koblan’s initial experiment. Collins had been so excited about the preliminary results that he invited Liu to collaborate — an offer not to be refused, since NIH has the world’s largest colony of progeria mice.

The pandemic slowed things down — Collins had to send home all his lab workers from March to July, until they figured out shifts and safe practices — but soon dozens of 3- and 14-day-old progeria mice were being injected with the base editor via an adeno-associated virus near the eye or in the abdominal cavity. (Both sites connect to the circulatory system, and the scientists wanted the base editor to reach as many types of tissue as possible.)

After six weeks, 10% to 60% of cells in different organs, from the aorta to liver, heart, muscle, and bone, had been successfully edited. But those numbers lowballed the improvement. The smooth muscle cells inside blood vessels “are usually a graveyard at six months,” Collins said. “Although the gene-edited mice had only about 20% of these cells corrected, it looked like 100% correction: The uncorrected cells had died, leaving only the healthy, base-edited cells. We’ve never seen anything like it” with any other experimental progeria therapy.

The CRISPR’d mice also looked better and moved better, in addition to living a median of 510 days vs. 215 days for untreated mice. Children in the clinical trial of the recently approved lonafarnib, from Eiger BioPharmaceuticals, lived an average of 2.5 years, or almost 20%, longer than untreated children.

Fourteen days in mice (the age when injecting the base editor had the best results) is comparable to 5 or 6 years in a child. Although more research needs to be done before a clinical trial could be launched — for one thing, Liu is still making improvements to the base editor — “we would be very disappointed if this ended up as just a paper,” Liu said. He is a co-founder of the base-editing company Beam Therapeutics, which said in a statement that it “is actively working with the research teams and with the Progeria Research Foundation to explore options for moving base editing technology forward for children living with progeria.”

Collins is hopeful that the usual decades between curing mice and curing people might not apply here. “Progeria is such a heartbreaking disease, it draws a lot of people to work on it,” he said. And the record-setting pace of Covid-19 vaccine development has made researchers everywhere question why clinical trials for cures can’t go faster: “We’ll see if we can jump over some hoops,” he said.","['Sharon Begley', 'Kate Sheridan', 'Adam Feuerstein', 'Damian Garde', 'Shirley Leung']",https://news.google.com,high
A Freezer Failure at Ukiah Valley Medical Forces a Rapid Deployment of 830 COVID-19 Vaccines – Redheaded Blackbelt,"After a compressor malfunctioned in a Ukiah Valley Medical freezer, 830 doses of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine had two hours to be administered before they spoiled. Adventist Health and Mendocino County leadership acted quickly and were able to administer every single dose in what Mendocino County CEO Carmel Angelo referred to as a “mass vaccination event.”

The freezer failure and subsequent mass distribution event caught the attention of media outlets throughout the country including the Los Angeles Times, CBS News, and The Hill.

President of Adventist Health Ukiah Judson Howe said that on Monday at approximately 2:00 a.m., a compressor housing 850 doses of the Moderna vaccine malfunctioned. President Howe said the Adventist Health Ukiah leadership team was informed of the malfunction at 11:30 a.m. Upon further investigation, as part of a manual process to monitor the freezer temperature, it was determined that the freezer malfunctioned at around 2:00 AM, which meant the hospital had until 2:00 p.m. to administer them since Moderna vaccines are viable for 12 hours after being thawed out.

Chief Medical Officer for Adventist Health in Mendocino County Dr. Bessant Parker said hospital staff in the middle of an executive meeting when they learned of the situation. Dr. Parker acted quickly, knowing “that I could not sleep if I let 830 doses go down the drain.” Dr. Parker said Adventist Health staff “stopped everything, got all hands on deck, and mobilized everyone” to administer 830 doses of the vaccine in the following two hours.

CEO Angelo said the County was informed of the vaccination opportunity at 11:30 a.m. being told they had to “either use it or lose it.” Approximately 60 county employees were gathered to be inoculated and the Department Operations Center was able to collaborate with infrastructure and public safety staff to provide them the vaccine.

Mendocino County’s Public Health Officer Dr. Andy Coren said that the collaboration between Adventist Health, Mendocino County Department of Public Health, the jail and their medical contractors, three skilled nursing facilities, a church, Ukiah Police, and EMTs, medical personnel were able to successfully vaccinate 850 people before the vaccines expired.

President Howe said Adventist Health was able to dispatch two vaccine shipments to both of Ukiah’s skilled nursing facilities Redwood Cove and Ukiah Post Acute.

Dr. Bessant explained that Adventist Health nursing staff were also deployed to the various entities to actually administer the vaccines.

Ukiah Valley Medical Public Information Officer Cici Winiger said two hundred of the doses were sent to the County for use in the jail.

Mendocino County Sheriff Matt Kendall said the vaccines were provided to Sheriff’s Office staff and Mendocino County Jail staff providing relief for the jail’s ongoing COVID-19 outbreak.

Ukiah Valley Medical Public Information Officer Cici Winiger explained that as soon as the urgency of the situation was realized, “We sent out a text to partner agencies and all staff to tell everyone they know. We somehow had to get as many people as possible here.” Winiger went on to say, “But we also couldn’t just send a mass notification as it might cause congestion and traffic issues. So we had to get the word out fast, but still controlled to use the vaccines and benefit the most number of people as possible in a short time.”

With the urgency of the situation in mind, Dr. Coren explained that the state’s tiered approach to vaccination administration was “not possible to observe while we made every effort to avoid wasting this scarce resource.” He added, “The tiers will be sorted out and we will be able to backfill for those who have not received it yet.

As word spread of the opportunity to receive the vaccine, President Howe said that over 200 Ukiah Valley residents began to arrive at the four different administration sites across Ukiah where residents could receive their dose. President Howe said nurses collected the information of those who received the vaccine. Vaccinated residents were provided Center for Disease Control Vaccination cards, and the patients will be contacted for their booster shot.

Reflecting on the situation, Dr. Bessant pointed out that over a period of two weeks prior to the freezer’s failure, approximately 800 vaccines were distributed to Mendocino County residents following the tiered protocol provided by the California Department of Public Health. Amazed, he said on Monday afternoon, “We distributed 850 vaccines in two hours.” The herculean effort made by Adventist Health staff was all to “make sure not a single vaccine went to waste.”

President Howe said that the turnout demonstrated the Ukiah community’s “enthusiasm and an appetite for the vaccinations.”

He said, We had physicians from partner clinics helping administer the vaccines, staff dropping everything to get it done. It was truly a community effort.” Howe then expressed appreciation for the Mendocino County Department of Public Health and other nurses and physicians of the community for “helping us out.”

Dr. Coren said, “Our county partnerships made this a success story.”","['Matt Lafever', 'Stephen Koch', 'No Good Deed ...']",https://news.google.com,high
When Will More Coronavirus Vaccines be Distributed in Orange County?,"77 Shares Reddit 5 Email

Questions and concerns continue to swirl on how exactly the Orange County Health Care Agency is going to roll out coronavirus vaccine distributions beyond medical staff at hospitals.

Editor’s Note: As Orange County’s only nonprofit & nonpartisan newsroom, Voice of OC brings you the best, most comprehensive local Coronavirus news absolutely free. No ads, no paywalls. We need your help. Please, make a tax-deductible donation today to support your local news.

OC isn’t the only county facing the vaccine concerns.

The rest of California is, too.

Gov. Gavin Newsom said the statewide efforts are “not good enough” at a Monday news conference.

“It’s gone too slowly,” Newsom said. “All of us want to see 100% of what’s received immediately administered into people’s arms.”

Newsom said only about a third of the 1.3 million vaccines have been administered.

On Tuesday, state public health officials warned the Orange County Health Care Agency to increase the coronavirus vaccine rollout after a slow start.

Officials also warned other counties.

Dr. Jason Cord, Orange County Medical Association president, said it’s difficult to inoculate on a wide scale with scarce resources and dwindling medical staff because of the tsunami of virus patients OC hospitals are facing.

“We’re all swamped with the work of the day to day to take care of the patients that are ill, that limits the ability to administer the vaccines,” Cord said. “We’re having to pull nurses and staff from clinical areas to do it.”

Cord sits on the OC vaccine task force, along with Orange County health officer Dr. Clayton Chau.

“You got to figure vaccine clinics are going to take staff as well — don’t get me wrong, we’re still doing it,” he said.

He said state public health officials require certain levels of staffing, similar to hospital surge plans that are required to be filed with the state.

“There’s not only a surge staffing requirement,” Cord said. “There’s vaccine staffing requirements as well.”

Numerous private care physicians and urgent care doctors have contacted Voice of OC, expressing their concern about when they’ll get the vaccine.

“I’m directly involved, right now, in working on making sure our non-hospital affiliated physicians and their staff get vaccinated as well,” Cord said.

At a news conference last month, Chau said there’s not enough vaccines for all of OC’s medical workers.

“As you can imagine it’s not enough. So we have to go down the line on tiering,” he said.

There’s various guidelines from health agencies at the federal and state level, along with national medical organizations — which could be adding to the vaccine rollout confusion.

Guidelines from the California Department of Public Health put hospital staff and paramedics in the top tier of the first phase, while primary care physicians and urgent care doctors are in the second tier of the first phase.

The OC Health Care Agency is using vaccine guidelines from the National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine, according to the agency’s website.

The CDC and the National Institutes of Health tasked the National Academies with producing the guidelines.

The group suggested a four-phased approach to vaccine distribution, with health care workers high up on the list — similar to the state’s tiering system.

“Included in Phase 1a would be ‘frontline’ health workers—health professionals who are involved in direct patient care, as well as those working in transport, environmental services, or other health care facility services—who risk exposure to bodily fluids or aerosols,” reads the guidelines.

Newsom said the state legislature is expected to consider $300 million in the upcoming budget to help with vaccine distribution, storage and other logistical issues — along with a public outreach campaign.

“We’re already working these last number of days to increase the distribution sites and, more importantly, to accelerate the efforts on who can administer the vaccines,” Newsom said, adding officials are looking into National Guard medical units, dentists and other clinics to help vaccine distribution.

Meanwhile, ambulance patients are facing longer wait times before being offloaded to Orange County hospitals as coronavirus patients continue to flood the local hospital system.

A Monday situation report from OC Emergency Medical Services shows 16 emergency rooms had wait times longer than 30 minutes and 10 emergency rooms had more than an hour wait times.

For comparison, 14 emergency rooms had a wait of more than 30 minutes and eight had more than an hour wait last Thursday.

And OC hit a new record Tuesday when it surpassed 2,200 hospitalized.

According to state hospital data, 2,236 people were hospitalized, including 504 in intensive care units — a 163% increase over the past month.

Orange County’s overall testing positivity continues to hang around 16%, with a 15.8% rate as of Tuesday, according to state data.

The poorest OC residents are again hit the hardest with nearly one in four people testing positive.

In a Tuesday email, OC Emergency Medical Services Director, Dr. Carl Schultz, said six hospitals have requested additional staffing support from the Health Care Agency.

“OC hospitals are requesting staff, but not specifically from the National Guard. After exhausting all their resources for staff, they request staff from the OC Health Care Agency’s (HCA) disaster coordinating center, the Agency Operations Center (AOC). They fill out several documents that describe their need and other issues. The AOC attempts to fill the requests from County assets. If there are none available, we send the request to the State,” Schultz said.

Schultz said if no state help is available, state officials coordinate with federal officials to get help to the hospitals.

“If this happens, the Federal management group may request deployment of the National Guard. At this time, there is no order to deploy National Guard assets to OC hospitals. There are nurses, respiratory therapists, and other medical providers that have been deployed to hospitals from other agencies and staffing companies,” he said.

The county Health Care Agency reported 1,376 new cases today — significantly down from the nearly 9,000 reported Monday.

Monday’s count stretched back at least two days because of maintenance on state servers.

OC is now averaging roughly 2,800 new cases a day over the past week.

State public health officials estimate roughly 12% of all newly infected people end up hospitalized within three weeks.

It’s a difficult virus for the medical community to tackle because some people don’t show any symptoms, yet can still spread it. Others feel slight symptoms, like fatigue and a mild fever.

Others end up in ICUs for days and weeks before making it out, while other people eventually die from the virus.

The virus has now killed 1,926 people out of 171,955 confirmed cases in OC, according to the county Health Care Agency.

The virus has already killed more than three times as many people as the flu does on a yearly average.

For context, Orange County has averaged around 20,000 deaths a year since 2016, including 543 annual flu deaths, according to state health data.

According to the state death statistics, cancer kills over 4,600 people, heart disease kills over 2,800, more than 1,400 die from Alzheimer’s disease and strokes kill over 1,300 people.

Orange County has already surpassed its yearly average 20,000 deaths, with 21,110 people dead as of November, according to the latest available state data.

In a Tuesday phone interview, UC Irvine epidemiologist and public health professor, Andrew Noymer, said January is shaping up to be the worst month of the pandemic.

“The fact of the matter is that January 2021 will go down in the annals of history as a crisis in the hospitals, you can take that one to the bank,” he said. “We’re in for a pounding, basically. I don’t know how else to put it. I’m not at all optimistic about the next six weeks.”

Here’s the latest on the virus numbers across Orange County from county data:

New strategy to fight botulinum toxin - expert available,"Related to new research published in the January issue of Science Translational Medicine, Patrick McNutt, PhD, of the Wake Forest Institute for Regenerative Medicine, was part of the research team that demonstrated a new ""Trojan horse"" approach that produces strong antidotal efficacy in treating lethal botulism in mice, guinea pigs and rhesus macaque monkeys.

Furthermore, in a companion article, an independent team demonstrated that a related drug has robust efficacy in mice.

""This is one of those serendipitous moments in science where two groups, working independently, demonstrate similar results for a long-standing problem,"" McNutt said. ""We are currently modifying this drug to enhance its therapeutic properties against botulism and exploring whether the same approach can be repurposed to treat other neuronal diseases.""

In 2010, Konstantin Ichtchenko (New York University School of Medicine) conceived of a novel 'trojan horse' strategy to treat botulism. This strategy is based on using a non-toxic form of BoNT to deliver therapeutic antibodies to paralyzed neurons, blocking wild-type toxin activity and accelerating recovery from paralysis. Over the past decade, Konstantin established collaborations with Patrick McNutt (Wake Forest Institute of Regenerative Medicine), Phil Band (Cytodel, Inc.) and Chuck Shoemaker (Tufts University) to develop and test this new drug in a variety of experimental models.

Botulinum neurotoxins (BoNTs) are a family of bacterial poisons responsible for the clinical disease known as botulism. BoNT acts within nerve terminals to destroy proteins necessary for evoking muscle contraction, causing muscle paralysis that develops into respiratory arrest at lethal concentrations. BoNT is the most poisonous substances known, with median lethal doses that are over a million-fold lower than cyanide.

Because of its extraordinary potency and long duration of action, the toxin is considered a Tier 1 agent by the CDC, which is reserved for the most dangerous public threats. These same properties render BoNT a highly effective cosmetic and therapeutic drug (e.g., BOTOX) with diverse clinical indications. Despite decades of effort, there are no antidotes for the life-threatening consequences of botulism. This failure is primarily because the toxin hides within the nerve terminal, where it poses a challenging target for delivery of therapeutic molecules.

A third of US families face a different kind of poverty,"DURHAM, N.C. -- Before the pandemic, one-third of U.S. households with children were already ""net worth poor,"" lacking enough financial resources to sustain their families for three months at a poverty level, finds new research from Duke University.

In 2019, 57 percent of Black families and 50 percent of Latino families with children were poor in terms of net worth. By comparison, the rate for white families was 24 percent.

""These 'net worth poor' households have no assets to withstand a sudden economic loss, like we have seen with COVID-19,"" said Christina Gibson-Davis, co-author of the study and professor of public policy and sociology at Duke University's Center for Child and Family Policy. ""Their savings are virtually nil, and they have no financial cushion to provide the basics for their children.""

The study is among the first to consider family poverty in terms of assets, not income. Using 1989-2019 data from the Survey of Consumer Finances, researchers analyzed net worth and income data from more than 19,000 U.S. households with children under age 18.

Among households with children, net worth poverty has been steadily rising over the past 30 years, the authors found. In 2019, a two-parent, two-child household was deemed to be net-worth poor if they had less than $6,500 in assets - or less than one-fourth of the federal poverty line.

Families in that category - those with perilously low levels of net worth -- outnumbered families who were poor based on income.

""Uncovering this aspect of poverty, which hinges on wealth, is game-changing,"" said Lisa Gennetian, co-author of the study and associate professor of early learning policy studies at Duke's Sanford School of Public Policy.

""Most policies focus on income and families meeting their day-to-day needs,"" Gennetian said. ""These efforts are important. But our findings suggest that they are not helping families increase savings that help set children up for success.""

Notably, Black and Latino families were twice as likely to experience net worth poverty than to have poverty-level incomes.

""Reducing one kind of poverty isn't helpful if another one is taking its place,"" said Lisa Keister, study co-author and a professor of sociology at Duke. ""Being net worth poor likely limits parents' abilities to invest in their kids and shapes how they think about their kids' future.""

The new research appears in the Journal of Marriage and Family.

""Even before the pandemic, many families with children were in a precarious situation,"" Gibson-Davis said. ""Things are not going to get better in the wake of COVID-19.""

The link between opioid medication and pancreatic cancer,"First study showing opioid use may be a risk factor contributing to the increasing incidence of pancreatic cancer

Researchers at Rush University Medical Center have found that opioid use might increase a person's risk of developing pancreatic cancer.

Published Jan. 6, the study, titled ""Opioid Use as a Potential Risk Factor for Pancreatic Cancer in the United States,"" is the first in the country to show evidence that opioid use may be an unidentified risk factor contributing to the increasing incidence of pancreatic cancer.

In fact, opioid misuse and overdose have evolved into a public health crisis. Approximately 70,000 drug overdose deaths were reported in 2017, 68% of which involved an opioid.¹ The use of prescription opioids for the management of chronic pain has increased remarkably, with more than 191 million opioid prescriptions given to patients in the United States in 2017. Not surprisingly, the opioid addiction rates among patients who are given opioid for chronic pain have increased, with 29% of such patients misusing opioids, and 12% developing an opioid use disorder.²

Pancreatic cancer rates also are increasing in the United States. Opioids have been shown to have a harmful effect on multiple types of cancer with recent data suggesting opium use as a possible risk factor for pancreatic cancer in West Central Asia. Population-based studies have suggested opium use to increase risk of pancreatic cancer in a dose dependent manner.³?? While opium use is not a common recreational habit in the United States, opioid use has been rising remarkably over the past decade.

Faraz Bishehsari, MD, PhD, the corresponding author of the study, and his team aimed to examine the possible association between the pattern of opioid use and the changes in the rates of pancreatic cancer during the years 1999-2016. Using the Center for Disease Control's Wonder online data (procured from the Vital Statistics Cooperative Program) the team extracted the opioid death rate as a surrogate for prescription and illicit opioid use. Incidence of pancreatic cancer was retrieved from the CDC's online database gathered from the U.S. Cancer Statistics Working Group. They extracted the pattern of the lifestyle and behavioral factors that over time could potentially affect the risk of pancreatic cancer.

Usman Barlass, MD, Ameya Deshmukh, PhD, and Todd Beck, MD, worked with Bishehsari on the study. Using national datasets, the team evaluated whether the trend in opioid usage could explain increasing pancreatic cancer diagnoses at the national and state levels over time after correcting for the potential confounding factors. They found that both pancreatic cancer and opioid death rates rose over time at the national and state levels. A prior state's opioid death rate significantly predicted the trend in the incidence of pancreatic cancer years after and had a significant effect on the estimated annual change in the rate of this cancer.

The collected data suggests a link between opioid consumption and the risk of pancreatic cancer. The next step to directly establish the role of opioids as a novel risk factor for pancreatic cancer is to conduct large population-based studies or longitudinal datasets that reliably register long-term outcomes in opioid users. Findings from the current study, once confirmed by the individual-level data on opioid consumption and risk of pancreatic cancer, could have direct clinical relevance by considering non-narcotic (alternative) pain control approaches in these patients.

The team proposes to investigate possible mechanisms that may link opioid use to the development and/or progression of pancreatic cancer. Consistent with the current findings, a recent post hoc analysis of two randomized controlled trials of patients with advanced cancers (including pancreatic cancer), revealed that that those treated frequently with an opioid antagonist had significantly improved overall survival compared to placebo.?

""Our mechanistic studies could provide further insights on the pathways that opioid could potentially impact progression of cancer,"" Bishehsari added.

"It’s Official: Trump Supporters Who Breached Capitol Are a Mob, Washington Post Staff Told","The question of what to call people engaged in angry protests has been a recurring theme in media this year. Over the summer, amid nationwide disturbances in the immediate aftermath of the George Floyd killing, newsrooms and activists alike tied themselves in knots over exactly what to call what was going on: Protests? Disturbances? Rebellion?

Today’s storming of the Capitol by supporters of President Donald Trump should cause no similar confusion, at least at the Washington Post. Per a message on one of the newsroom’s Slack channels from Metro Editor Mike Semel, Post editor Marty Baron wants to use the shortest, least euphemistic language for what to call a large group of people acting in defiance of law and public safety:

“The people who breached the capitol are not protesters, they are a mob, per Marty”

It’s official—good news for journalism and a win for the English language.

Local NPR affiliate WAMU, meanwhile, has picked a somewhat longer term—but still one that’s not the normal overly cautious vocabulary of newsrooms. The members of the mob, reporter Martin Austermuehle Tweeted, are heretofore “insurrectionists.”

.@wamu885 and @dcist have made the decision to refer to the people inside the U.S. Capitol as insurrectionists, not merely protesters. It's accurate. — Martin Austermuhle (@maustermuhle) January 6, 2021

Attorney of woman who falsely accused Black teen of phone theft speaks out,"National Review

On Tuesday, authorities in Wisconsin announced they would not be prosecuting Rusten Sheskey, the officer who shot and paralyzed Jacob Blake in August of last year — an incident that set off protests and riots in Kenosha, a city near the Illinois border. To justify this decision, they released two reports, one from the Kenosha County District Attorney’s Office and another from Noble Wray, a retired police chief and Obama-administration police reformer who’d been asked to render an independent assessment.Some important details of the shooting remain unclear, largely because Kenosha police did not have body cameras at the time. The incident was captured only on bystanders’ cell phones, videos from which do not show the whole situation.

"Vaccine Rollouts in Europe Are Off to a Shaky Start, Even as Lockdowns Expand","A nearly empty street in London, Jan. 5, 2021. (Andrew Testa/The New York Times)

With a more contagious variant of the coronavirus forcing England to impose a strict new national lockdown and European nations extending restrictions in the face of rising cases, political leaders have promised that mass vaccinations will bring an end to the suffering.

But in the race to beat the virus, the virus is still way out in front.

There are shortages of needles in Italy, Greece and other countries. Spain has not trained enough nurses. France has only managed to vaccinate around 2,000 people. Poland’s program was rocked by scandal after it was revealed that celebrities were given preferential treatment. There are calls in Germany to take control over vaccine purchases from European Union authorities. Nearly every country in Europe has complained about burdensome paperwork.

Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York Times

And then there is the Netherlands, which did not even begin its campaign until Wednesday.

Around the world, inoculation efforts are rolling out slower than promised, even as new cases soar and record numbers of virus patients flood hospitals, placing a double burden on health care providers tasked with leading vaccination drives.

In Europe, where most countries have been under varying degrees of lockdown for months, frustration is building as restrictions have been stepped up or extended while national vaccination efforts are stymied by various problems.

The threat posed by the fast-spreading variant is adding extra urgency to an already daunting challenge. And even in places where the rollout has been relatively smooth, it is not nearly fast enough to get ahead of the virus.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson said England would be locked down until inoculations reached the four most vulnerable groups: nursing home residents and those who care for them, everyone over the age of 70, front line health and social care workers, and extremely vulnerable individuals.

“If we succeed in vaccinating all those groups, we will have removed huge numbers of people from the path of the virus,” he said.

Story continues

Johnson said that goal could be achieved by the middle of February, but that the pace of vaccinations would need to increase drastically.

The four groups he cited included 13.9 million people, according to Nadhim Zahawi, the minister overseeing the vaccine effort.

Since the campaign started on Dec. 8, 1.1 million people in England have been vaccinated, Johnson said Tuesday. Notably, 23% of people over 80 have gotten inoculations, and that age group could be fully vaccinated within three weeks, he said.

With the introduction on Monday of the first doses of the vaccine developed by the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca, British officials said the campaign could be ramped up.

To meet the February target, 2 million doses need to be given every week.

Countries of the European Union, meanwhile, started their campaigns weeks after Britain and the United States because of a slower approval process and have had to rely on a single vaccine, made by Pfizer and BioNTech.

While the bloc’s medical regulatory agency is expected to approve a vaccine from Moderna this week, it has yet to begin consideration of the Oxford-AstraZeneca one, which is easier to distribute as it does not need to be kept at extremely cold temperatures.

For the moment, one of the biggest problems in Europe is distribution.

The situation is similar to that in the United States, where about 4.5 million people have received a dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, using only a fraction of the 15 million doses delivered by manufacturers.

One complicating factor is that some countries have turned to local health authorities to develop their own strategies, leading to problems.

In Spain, it is a shortage of nurses. For instance, in the Catalonia region less than a fifth of the doses on hand have been used and local health authorities acknowledge they do not have enough trained nurses.

Health Minister Salvador Illa said on Monday that 82,000 doses had been administered in Spain since the rollout began on Dec. 27, a pace far short of a stated goal of vaccinating 70% of 47 million people by the end of this summer.

“It is incomprehensible that there are not enough staff and resources to continue to vaccinate every day,” Manuel Perez-Alonso, a genetics professor at the University of Valencia, wrote on Twitter.

Germany also began its national immunization campaign on Dec. 27, and has now vaccinated more than 316,960 people, with the focus largely on nursing home residents and those aged 80 and older.

Yet the country has become engulfed in a politicized debate over the wisdom of waiting for vaccine approval from the European Medical Agency and coordinating purchases with its European partners.

The federal government in Berlin is responsible for acquiring vaccine doses, while the country’s 16 states are responsible for administering them under a strategy centered on immunization centers. From the centers, teams are dispatched to vaccinate the estimated 40,000 people living in nursing homes and their caregivers.

“It is more difficult to immunize people in nursing homes with mobile teams,” said Hanno Kautz, a Health Ministry spokesman. “If we were to start handing out appointments at the immunization centers, we would have very different numbers. But we intentionally prioritized the most vulnerable groups and that is where we are beginning.”

The situation in the Netherlands, by contrast, is inexplicable.

In a country where many pay 50% of their wages in taxes, expecting top government performance in return, there is widespread anger that the Netherlands will be the last nation in Europe to start vaccinations.

“We are the village idiot of Europe,” the right-wing politician Geert Wilders said in Parliament on Tuesday, “It’s simply incomprehensible that we are the last country in Europe to start.”

Health Minister Hugo de Jonge is facing increasing criticism from legislators wanting to know why vaccinations did not start sooner after the shots arrived on Dec. 26.

He has defended the vaccination process, which critics call overly bureaucratic and slow, saying it needed to be “diligent.”

Italy has been more successful, vaccinating 178,939 people, the second-largest number in the EU after Germany.

But that still only accounts for only 37.3% of the doses it received, and less than 0.3% of the population. At the current rate, it would take six years to vaccinate the nation of 60 million.

While health officials have said that the process of freezing and unfreezing doses has slowed efforts, experts blame bureaucracy and a shortage of staff.

“There are a number of critical aspects in this vaccination campaign,” Giovanni Toti, president of the northwestern region of Liguria, said in a phone interview. “It takes a long procedure to receive the informed consent from those patients who are incapacitated and live in retirement homes.”

Toti said hospitals in his region had also received the wrong needles for the Pfizer vaccine.

In the northern region of Lombardy, the epicenter of Italy’s first wave of the coronavirus, the opposition has urged the region’s top health official to quit after he justified vaccination campaign delays by saying that he refused to call back doctors and nurses on vacation.

French health officials have argued that the pace of vaccinations — with only 2,000 doses administered — is deliberately cautious, in part to convince the country’s many vaccine skeptics that nothing will be forced on them. Critics also say that the effort has been hampered by red tape in the medical system.

President Emmanuel Macron, who has said that he would not tolerate an “unjustified slowness” in the campaign, has pressed aides to make sure the pace of inoculations accelerates, according to the Journal du Dimanche.

One group of several dozen French doctors and health professionals warned in an open letter on Tuesday that “vaccination must be seen today as a race against time.”

“And even if this vaccine, while not mandatory, is worrying to some of our fellow citizens,” they wrote in the letter, first published by Le Parisien newspaper, “state authorities have the duty to rapidly address the expectations of millions of French people who are impatiently waiting to get vaccinated.”

Democrats close in on Senate control with Warnock win and Ossoff lead,"The Rev. Raphael Warnock visits a mural honoring a civil rights pioneer in Marietta, Ga., on election day. (Sandy Huffaker / AFP/Getty Images)

Democrats were within reach of winning control of the Senate on Wednesday as they celebrated the victory of the Rev. Raphael Warnock in one of Georgia’s two runoff races and waited for final votes to be counted in the other.

The contest between Democrat Jon Ossoff and Republican David Perdue, whose Senate term expired Sunday, remained too close to call. But Ossoff's razor-thin lead widened overnight to more than 16,000 votes by Wednesday morning, with about 98% of the vote counted — a bigger gap than that between President-elect Joe Biden, who won Georgia, and President Trump in November's election.

Most of the remaining uncounted votes in the state were from the Atlanta and Savannah regions, areas where Democrats have piled up significant majorities.

A key question is whether the Ossoff-Perdue race will be decided by a margin wide enough to avoid a recount. Under Georgia law, a candidate can request a recount if the margin is less than half a percentage point.

Victory for both Warnock and Ossoff would be a major boon for Biden and increase his chances of enacting his legislative agenda.

Warnock's win makes him the first Black senator from Georgia. CNN, MSNBC and the Associated Press called the election for Warnock early Wednesday after he amassed a lead of more than 40,000 votes over his opponent, Sen. Kelly Loeffler.

""Georgia, I am honored by the faith you have shown in me,"" Warnock said in a video statement. ""I am going to the Senate to work for all of Georgia.""

Noting the historic nature of his victory, Warnock talked of his mother casting a vote for him.

""The other day, because this is America, the 82-year-old hands that used to pick somebody else's cotton went to the polls and picked her youngest son to be a United States senator,"" he said.

Loeffler did not concede, telling supporters she believed she had ""a path to victory.""

""This is a game of inches; we are going to win this election and we are going to save this country,"" she said.

Story continues

Ossoff's campaign issued a statement early Wednesday saying that ""when all the votes are counted, we fully expect that Jon Ossoff will have won.""

Already, Republicans were battling over blame for the apparent loss in races they believed they would win, with many pointing fingers at President Trump for his divisive attacks on other Republican elected officials.

“Everything he has done made it less likely that we would win,"" one longtime Republican strategist said Tuesday night as the returns came in.

""Donald Trump doesn’t want Republicans to win,"" because when they do, ""it makes it look like he is the only Republican in the country who cannot win,"" the strategist added, speaking anonymously to avoid retribution from the president.

A final outcome may not be known until overseas and military ballots are counted. By law, overseas and military ballots have until Friday to arrive at election offices.

Republicans only have to win one of the two runoff seats to maintain majority control of the Senate. If Democrats win both races, the chamber will be tied 50 to 50, with Vice President-elect Kamala Harris holding the tiebreaking vote to give Democrats control, which would allow them to approve major parts of Biden's agenda, as well as his nominees.

Democrats outperformed the GOP among the nearly 3.1 million Georgians who voted early, and as the votes came in, Republicans appeared to be falling short of their hopes of making up that ground with a strong election day showing.

Turnout was high in key Democratic areas, but appeared to be less so in some of the most conservative areas of the state, such as northwest Georgia, where Trump campaigned Sunday.

Republicans have held both of Georgia's Senate seats for 15 years, but the state has become increasingly competitive, and Biden defeated Trump here by a narrow margin — just under 12,000 votes — in November.

Going into the race, there was just one thing everyone seemed to agree on: The results would be close.

Jack Kingston, a former Republican congressman from Georgia’s 1st District, credited Democrats’ massive get-out-the-vote machine. Republicans sent out fliers to potential voters, he said, while Democrats sent out handwritten letters. Democrats also mailed voters forms to request absentee ballots and offered them rides to the polls.

“The Democrats have worked their tails off,” he said.

Among the most promising signs for Democrats: Their base of Black voters showed up in force early, representing 31% of the early vote as opposed to 28% in the general election. More than 123,000 of those who voted early after skipping November's election were Black, Latino and Asian Americans.

Republicans banked on strong turnout in rural counties to overtake the early Democratic lead. On Tuesday, Loeffler and Perdue sent out a joint statement urging their supporters to go to the polls. The two said they were “encouraged” by reports of high voter turnout in traditionally GOP territory in northern Georgia, but such last-minute appeals are not often a sign of confidence.

The two Republicans warned it would be a “very close election” that “could come down to the difference of just a few votes in a few precincts.”

“This generational election will be decided by the votes cast in the next few hours — no one should be sitting on the sidelines. Go vote!” they wrote.

The Republican campaign may have been hindered by an extraordinary level of intraparty fighting as Trump campaigned to reverse Biden’s victory in Georgia and attacked GOP officials for failing to do more to support his unsubstantiated claims of voting fraud in the state.

Many Republicans had worried for weeks that Trump’s attacks on the November election would discourage supporters from turning out.

“Really, these last two months have just been painful,” said Allen Peake, a former Georgia state representative from Macon.

“To watch the president go down this rabbit hole, I’m like every other Republican; I cringe, I wonder what he’s going to say, what he’s going to do, what other embarrassment he’s going to bring upon himself, the party and the country.”

With the stakes so high, the two sides spent more than half a billion dollars on the two-month runoff campaign, and each race broke the record for spending in a Senate race. The Democratic candidates raised considerably more money than the Republican incumbents, but spending by outside groups — mostly four super PACs affiliated with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) — gave the Republicans an overall advantage.

There were few snafus Tuesday as hundreds of thousands of voters across the state poured into polling stations on a chilly but bright, sunny day to cast their ballots.

Wait times across the state averaged about one minute, according to the secretary of state’s office.

Republicans had been favored early on to win the runoffs, which were needed because no candidate in either race got more than 50% of the vote in November. In past runoffs, GOP voters have turned out in more force, and the Republican candidates also performed slightly better than Democrats in the general election.

In November, Perdue received about 80,000 more votes than Ossoff, but fell short of the 50% threshold needed to win. In the other race, a special election that featured multiple candidates from each party, Warnock finished ahead of Loeffler with about a third of the vote, but Republican candidates overall narrowly won more votes than Democrats.

The race was made much more competitive as Democrats ran a well-financed, nationally driven campaign, and grass-roots voter mobilization groups fanned out across the state to ramp up early voter turnout across Atlanta’s urban and suburban counties.

For Democrats, winning both seats would allow them to avert gridlock in Congress and give Biden a chance to enact his legislative agenda. The election is also a test of whether Biden’s victory against Trump here was just a one-off or represents a significant realignment of political power in this Southern battleground state.

As Stacey Abrams, the Democrats' former candidate for governor, put it Monday at a rally: “Georgia, we have a chance tomorrow to prove what happened in November wasn’t a fluke, but the future.”

For weeks, Trump and the Republican candidates have warned that if the Democrats win both Senate seats, the party would have full control of both the White House and Congress, giving Biden a free hand.

In reality, a 50-50 Senate with Harris breaking ties would still leave Biden significantly constrained, able to move no further than the most moderate Democrat would allow. Sen. Joe Manchin III of West Virginia, for example, has already publicly said he would block some goals sought by progressive Democrats, such as eliminating filibusters on legislation in the Senate.

“The control there is going to really be in the hands of the moderates,” said Alan Abramowitz, a professor of political science at Emory University. “Several of these moderate Democrats from several swing states or red states are going to have a lot to say about what can be passed. … Republicans’ warnings about radical socialism are complete nonsense.”

Still, having a majority in the Senate — even by the narrowest of margins — can make a huge difference.

By tradition, the majority leader sets the Senate's agenda — a power that has expanded greatly in recent decades. The current leader, McConnell, has used that power to bottle up House-passed bills he opposes, and would no doubt continue that despite having generally friendly relations with Biden.

Democrats' bills on voting rights, government ethics and imposing limits on partisan gerrymandering of congressional districts are among those that McConnell likely would block but which Senate Democratic Leader Charles E. Schumer of New York could be expected to advance if the Democrats win control.

Control of the Senate would also give Biden a clear path to filling vacancies in federal courts. McConnell blocked Senate confirmation of many judges President Obama chose during his last two years in office. That created a large backlog that played a big role in Trump's ability to appoint more than 220 federal judges, shifting the judiciary to the right. Biden could shift it back again, in part because a large number of older federal judges, mostly appointed by President Clinton, have contemplated taking semi-retired senior status once Biden takes office. But if Republicans keep control of the Senate, McConnell could block any new appointments.

An even more immediate impact would probably come with Biden's Cabinet selections. With a Democratic Senate, few if any of Biden's picks would appear endangered. If Republicans keep the majority, several face tough opposition, including California Atty. Gen. Xavier Becerra, Biden's choice for Health and Human Services secretary, and Neera Tanden, his choice to head the Office of Management and Budget.

Whatever party ultimately wins Tuesday's runoffs, Georgia is likely to keep its battleground status.

“The new normal is that Georgia is more electorally competitive,” said Andra Gillespie, an associate professor of political science at Emory.

“We are entering an era where Democrats can now have a reasonable expectation that, if they work hard to campaign, they can win elections,” she said. “But that doesn't guarantee them victory.”

Senate control key deciding factor for voters in Georgia runoffs,"National Review

On Tuesday, authorities in Wisconsin announced they would not be prosecuting Rusten Sheskey, the officer who shot and paralyzed Jacob Blake in August of last year — an incident that set off protests and riots in Kenosha, a city near the Illinois border. To justify this decision, they released two reports, one from the Kenosha County District Attorney’s Office and another from Noble Wray, a retired police chief and Obama-administration police reformer who’d been asked to render an independent assessment.Some important details of the shooting remain unclear, largely because Kenosha police did not have body cameras at the time. The incident was captured only on bystanders’ cell phones, videos from which do not show the whole situation. But when it comes to the question of a criminal prosecution, the documents are highly compelling: There is no way to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Sheskey fired without justification. If anything, the evidence tips in the opposite direction.Officer Sheskey and two other cops showed up in response to a call from Laquisha Booker, the mother of Blake’s kids. She said that Blake had taken the keys to her rental vehicle, and that he’d borrowed vehicles from her and crashed them in the past. She added that Blake was “not supposed to be here,” but that she’d let him visit for his son’s birthday. Police dispatchers told the officers that Blake had a felony arrest warrant for domestic-violence offenses and sexual assault, meaning they’d have to arrest him if they found him, under Kenosha Police Department policy.When they arrived, according to the officers and another witness, Booker said that Blake was trying to take her car and her kids — and Blake was seen putting a child in a gray SUV. Sheskey has said he wasn’t sure if the child was Blake’s or not. In truth, there were three kids in the SUV, all Blake’s.The cops tried to arrest Blake. He resisted. Two different officers shot him with Tasers, but he ripped out the probes. And to make matters worse, Blake produced a knife. Despite some claims in the media that Blake was “unarmed,” he admitted having the knife himself, there’s video of the officers telling him to drop it, and the weapon was found open in the SUV after the incident. According to the DA office’s report, Blake also resisted arrest with a knife in a 2010 incident.And then came a fateful series of decisions. As seen in the widely disseminated cell-phone video, Blake walked around the SUV and opened the door. Sheskey followed and grabbed Blake’s shirt, then fired seven times. He says he stopped shooting when Blake dropped the knife, consistent with his training to shoot until the threat stops.Were the shots justified? The key question is whether Sheskey reasonably believed lethal force was necessary to stop an imminent threat of “death or great bodily harm,” whether to him or to someone else.Sheskey, another officer, and some witnesses say that Blake twisted his body toward Sheskey before the shots rang out, which would have moved the knife toward the officer. Per the district attorney’s office, “Officer Sheskey stated that for the first time Jacob Blake showed intent to harm [as opposed to just resisting arrest] by driving the knife towards Officer Sheskey's torso.” Such an action would clearly justify deadly force.However, this gesture is not obvious in the video, at least not to me. (You can see the recording on YouTube, and move frame-by-frame using the “<” and “>” buttons on your keyboard.) That said, I wouldn’t say the video disproves these claims, either — the more important question in court, where the burden is on the prosecution — because the SUV’s door and the cops’ bodies obscure some of Blake’s movements.And at any rate, as Noble Wray’s report adds, whether> Blake drove the knife forward or not, a reasonable officer could view himself as being in imminent danger. P.O. Sheskey was literally holding on to Blake's shirt, and Blake had a knife in his hand, actively resisting, attempting to get into the vehicle. This circumstance is only compounded with the kids being in the vehicle.Of course, it was Sheskey’s own decision to grab Blake’s shirt, and there are various ways we might second-guess the officers’ actions even if we don’t prosecute them. But when it comes to those crucial final moments, the truth is that Blake put them in an impossible situation. They could have kept a safe distance from the guy with a sexual-assault warrant armed with a knife, but that would have meant letting that guy get into a vehicle they knew contained at least one child — an option that could lead to a high-speed chase or a hostage situation, both possibilities that Sheskey says he feared at the time. On the other hand, once Sheskey got close to a knife-wielding suspect, the chance he’d need to use deadly force shot way up, because knives are incredibly deadly at that range and there isn’t much time to ascertain and react to a suspect’s movements.Or, as Wray put it:> Officer Sheskey had determined that it was dangerous for the public and the child in the car to let Blake go. P.O. Sheskey felt he could not retreat once he made the decision that harm could come to the kids or to the public. I found Officer Sheskey's analysis was reasonable based on the limited information he had at the time. Officer Sheskey did not know the relationship between Blake and the child. I am not sure if it makes much difference. The U.S. Department of Justice reports in 2010 that 200,000 kids are abducted mostly by a family friend or parent. Blake's severe resistance to being taken into custody would lead a reasonable officer to believe that he would engage in a high-speed pursuit.I have no idea what actually would have happened if Sheskey hadn’t fired. I’m glad I didn’t have to make that decision myself. And I’m glad prosecutors aren’t dragging this situation out by pursuing a case they could never win.",[],https://news.yahoo.com,high
"As Republicans attack democracy and deny Trump's loss, the next generation is watching","For the past four years, President Donald Trump has tested the limits of democracy. In his latest effort to undermine it, Trump was heard pressuring Georgia Republicans to overturn the election results, without facts or evidence. Throughout his presidency, especially after the 2020 election, he has made his intentions clear: At the expense of democracy, his personal and political interests come first. It is a scary sight to see.

But Trump is not the only one testing the strength of our democracy. What should be of greater concern is the Republican Party transforming itself into a party that solely embraces Trump. No longer does Sen. Ted Cruz say Trump’s “business dealings with the mob, with the mafia” are a problem. The time when Sen. Lindsey Graham called Trump a “kook” and “unfit for office” is long gone. The same Sen. Marco Rubio who called Trump a “con artist” now praises him.

A personality cult instead of a party

In short, Americans have witnessed a Republican Party that has evolved into a cult of personality surrounding Trump. And that cult has become all the more apparent in the days and weeks since the 2020 election.

Nearly two-thirds of House Republicans signed onto an amicus brief last month seeking to prevent the certification of electors in states Joe Biden won. That effort failed. Now Cruz and 10 other Republican senators, along with over 100 House members, plan to object when Congress counts the Electoral College votes Wednesday. That effort is also doomed, since the House is controlled by Democrats.

President-elect Joe Biden on Jan. 4, 2021, in Atlanta.

There are Republicans, among them Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, Sen. Ben Sasse of Nebraska and Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, pushing back on Trump’s baseless election-related allegations and behavior. Unfortunately, however, their voices are not as amplified as those who spread Trump’s lies and falsehoods. So long as Republicans in Congress continue enabling Trump and challenging norms and laws in unprecedented ways, they will do long-lasting damage to our democracy.

Story continues

Of particular concern is the impact Republicans’ conduct will have on current students and future generations. In 2018, the National Assessment of Educational Progress reported that only about 24% of eighth-graders performed at or above proficient level on the civics exam. The 2018 results are more shocking when compared to the results of 2014, in which only 23% of eighth-graders performed at or above proficient level on the civics exam. The little progress that eighth-graders have made on their civics exam is worrisome.

Critical need for critical thinking: Fair or not, we need free college and student loan forgiveness — and so does democracy

To the extent possible during COVID-19, teachers and school administrators have an especially important role to play in boosting civic knowledge among young people. Teachers can revamp their curriculum and administrators can make civic engagement and education a priority both inside and outside the classroom. Taking those steps will ensure that students gain a better understanding of the functions of the U.S. government and Constitution.

GOP message is rules don't matter

However, as Trump continues challenging election results and young people increasingly get their information on social media platforms, it is imperative for Republican elected officials to do their part and model what good governance looks like. But they aren’t — and the complicity among many Republicans will have far-reaching effects on the younger generation.

By enabling Trump and his behavior, Republicans are sending a powerful message to young people: that rules and laws no longer need to be followed as long as our party wins. It is antithetical to what the framers of the Constitution intended and to what teachers are trying to teach their students about the U.S. government and Constitution.

Former Sen. Orrin Hatch: We must fix civics education to protect American democracy

This week, though, Republicans have an opportune chance to prove their allegiance to the Constitution and democracy. Instead of blindly supporting the president’s unfounded claims, Republicans in Congress must certify Joe Biden as the 46th President. Doing so will show young people that Republicans still care about what the government stands for and should be about. More importantly, with Democrats and Republicans standing together, they can begin modeling the type of good governance that young people need to see now more than ever before.

Any elected official who took an oath to defend the Constitution on Sunday, Jan. 3, when they were sworn in to the new Congress, will have one simple task this week: Reject President Trump’s attempt to overturn the election and vote to certify Joe Biden as our next president. Anything short of that would be a betrayal not only for democracy, but for students and civics education for generations to come. Democracy and students are watching.

"Trump to Pence: Nice Career, Shame if Something Happened to It","The Conversation

Mike Pence has remained one of the only constants in the often chaotic Trump administration.Variously described as “vanilla,” “steady” and loyal to the point of being “sycophantic,” he is, in the words of one profile, an “everyman’s man with Midwest humility and approachability,” and in another, a “61-year-old, soft-spoken, deeply religious man.”But that humility and loyalty are being tested as his tenure as vice president draws to an end. “I hope Mike Pence comes through for us,” Trump told supporters at a rally on Monday, seemingly under the mistaken belief that Pence can overturn the election result as he presides over the Electoral College vote count at a joint session of Congress today. Balancing the ticketThroughout the past four years, the vice president has offered a striking contrast to the mercurial, abrasive temperament of his commander in chief. Indeed, in his acceptance speech at the 2016 Republican National Convention, Pence joked that he’d been chosen because Trump, with his “large personality,” “colorful style,” and “lots of charisma,” was “looking for some balance on the ticket.” Commentators have attributed Pence’s steadiness to his Hoosier roots and his “savvy political operator” skills. But it is his religious beliefs that perhaps inform his politics and style more than anything else; as Pence has oft repeated, he is “a Christian, conservative and Republican – in that order.” In a 2011 profile during Pence’s run for Indiana governor, noted state political columnist Brian Howey remarked, “Pence doesn’t just wear his faith on his sleeve, he wears the whole Jesus jersey.”It isn’t a characterization that Pence has shied away from. “My Christian faith is at the very heart of who I am,” Pence said during the 2016 vice presidential debate.Richard Land, former president of the Southern Baptist Convention’s Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission and current president of Southern Evangelical Seminary in Charlotte, told the Atlantic in 2018, “Mike Pence is the 24-karat-gold model of what we want in an evangelical politician. I don’t know anyone who’s more consistent in bringing his evangelical Christian worldview to public policy.” But as a scholar of U.S. religion and culture, I believe that Pence’s faith and political identities are more complex than these statements suggest. In fact, one can trace three distinct conversion experiences in his biography. Three-point conversionGrowing up in an Irish Catholic family with five siblings, working-class roots and Democratic political commitments, Pence attended Catholic school, served as an altar boy at his family’s church, idolized John F. Kennedy and was a youth coordinator for the local Democratic Party in his teens.It was as a freshman at Hanover College in 1978 that Pence experienced an evangelical conversion while attending a music festival in Kentucky billed as the “Christian Woodstock.”For some years afterward he remained active in the Catholic Church, attending Mass regularly, serving as a youth minister and seriously considering joining the priesthood. At the same time, he and his future wife Karen were part of a demographic shift of Americans who “had grown up Catholic and still loved many things about the Catholic Church, but also really loved the concept of having a very personal relationship with Christ,” as a close friend put it.By the mid-1990s he was a married father of three who identified as a “born-again, evangelical Catholic,” an unusual term that has caused some consternation among both evangelicals and Catholics.In subsequent interviews, Pence has spoken freely about how his 1978 conversion gave him a “personal relationship with Jesus Christ” that “changed everything.” But he has tended to avoid labeling his religious views when pressed, referring to himself as a “pretty ordinary Christian” who “cherishes his Catholic upbringing.” He has attended nondenominational evangelical churches with his family since at least 1995. Pence’s political conversion was more clear cut. Though he voted for Jimmy Carter in the 1980 presidential election, he quickly came to embrace Ronald Reagan’s economic and social conservatism and his populist appeal. In a 2016 speech at the Reagan Library, Pence credited Reagan with inspiring him to “leave the party of my youth and become a Republican like he did.” “His broad-shouldered leadership changed my life,” he said. Pence has frequently compared Trump to Reagan, arguing that they have the same “broad shoulders.”Pence ran unsuccessfully for Congress in 1988 and 1990, and the second bruising loss precipitated a third conversion, this time in political style. In a 1991 published essay titled “Confessions of a Negative Campaigner,” he described himself as a sinner and wrote of his “conversion” to the belief that “negative campaigning is wrong.” Between 1992 and 1999, Pence honed his blend of family values and fiscal conservatism in an eponymous conservative talk show.The show’s popularity provided a springboard to a successful run for Congress in 2000. During his six terms in the House, Pence acquired a reputation for “unalloyed traditional conservatism” and principled opposition to Republican Party leadership on issues like No Child Left Behind and Medicare prescription drug expansion. Religious actsIn addition to his “unsullied” reputation as a “culture warrior,” he also attracted attention for following the “Billy Graham Rule” of avoiding meeting with women alone and avoiding events where alcohol was served when his wife was not present. During the 2016 vice presidential debate, Pence said that his entire career in public service stems from a commitment to “live out” his religious beliefs, “however imperfectly.”One of those beliefs is his opposition to abortion, grounded in his reading of particular biblical passages. As a congressman in 2007, he was the first to sponsor legislation defunding Planned Parenthood, and did so repeatedly until the first defunding bill passed in 2011. “I long for the day when Roe v. Wade is sent to the ash heap of history,” he said at the time.In 2016, over the objections of many Republican state representatives, he signed the most restrictive set of anti-abortion measures in the country into law, making him a conservative hero. Among other things, the bill prevented women from terminating pregnancies for reasons including fetal disability such as Down syndrome. Although opponents succeeded in getting the bill overturned in the courts, Indiana is still seen as one of the most anti-abortion states in America.As vice president, Pence also cast the tie-breaking Senate vote to allow states to withhold federal family planning funds from Planned Parenthood in 2017.Pence has also been an outspoken opponent of LGBTQ rights. He opposed the inclusion of sexual orientation in hate crimes legislation and the end of the military’s “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” policy. He likewise supported both state and federal constitutional amendments to ban same-sex marriage, and expressed disappointment at the 2015 Obergefell decision, which required all states to recognize such unions.At the same time he has been a strong supporter of “religious freedom,” particularly for Christians.In March 2015, as Indiana governor, he signed the state’s Religious Freedom Restoration Act “to ensure that religious liberty is fully protected.” The act ignited a firestorm of nationwide controversy: Critics alleged that it would allow for individuals and businesses to legally discriminate against members of the LGBTQ community. Under pressure from LGBTQ activists, liberals, business owners and moderate Republicans, Pence signed an amendment a week later stipulating that it did not authorize discrimination. Staked reputationPence’s religious and political biography mirrors key political and religious shifts over the past 40 years, from the rise of the religious right and its growing influence in the Republican Party to the conservative coalition of evangelicals and Catholics across denominational lines, to the legacy of the “outsider” celebrity president.These threads converge in Mike Pence, whose “24-karat,” “unalloyed” conservative credentials were instrumental in rallying evangelical voters behind Trump in the 2016 election and who has staked his political future on continuing to defend him.This article is republished from The Conversation, a nonprofit news site dedicated to sharing ideas from academic experts.

On Tuesday, authorities in Wisconsin announced they would not be prosecuting Rusten Sheskey, the officer who shot and paralyzed Jacob Blake in August of last year — an incident that set off protests and riots in Kenosha, a city near the Illinois border. To justify this decision, they released two reports, one from the Kenosha County District Attorney’s Office and another from Noble Wray, a retired police chief and Obama-administration police reformer who’d been asked to render an independent assessment.Some important details of the shooting remain unclear, largely because Kenosha police did not have body cameras at the time. The incident was captured only on bystanders’ cell phones, videos from which do not show the whole situation. But when it comes to the question of a criminal prosecution, the documents are highly compelling: There is no way to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Sheskey fired without justification. If anything, the evidence tips in the opposite direction.Officer Sheskey and two other cops showed up in response to a call from Laquisha Booker, the mother of Blake’s kids. She said that Blake had taken the keys to her rental vehicle, and that he’d borrowed vehicles from her and crashed them in the past. She added that Blake was “not supposed to be here,” but that she’d let him visit for his son’s birthday. Police dispatchers told the officers that Blake had a felony arrest warrant for domestic-violence offenses and sexual assault, meaning they’d have to arrest him if they found him, under Kenosha Police Department policy.When they arrived, according to the officers and another witness, Booker said that Blake was trying to take her car and her kids — and Blake was seen putting a child in a gray SUV. Sheskey has said he wasn’t sure if the child was Blake’s or not. In truth, there were three kids in the SUV, all Blake’s.The cops tried to arrest Blake. He resisted. Two different officers shot him with Tasers, but he ripped out the probes. And to make matters worse, Blake produced a knife. Despite some claims in the media that Blake was “unarmed,” he admitted having the knife himself, there’s video of the officers telling him to drop it, and the weapon was found open in the SUV after the incident. According to the DA office’s report, Blake also resisted arrest with a knife in a 2010 incident.And then came a fateful series of decisions. As seen in the widely disseminated cell-phone video, Blake walked around the SUV and opened the door. Sheskey followed and grabbed Blake’s shirt, then fired seven times. He says he stopped shooting when Blake dropped the knife, consistent with his training to shoot until the threat stops.Were the shots justified? The key question is whether Sheskey reasonably believed lethal force was necessary to stop an imminent threat of “death or great bodily harm,” whether to him or to someone else.Sheskey, another officer, and some witnesses say that Blake twisted his body toward Sheskey before the shots rang out, which would have moved the knife toward the officer. Per the district attorney’s office, “Officer Sheskey stated that for the first time Jacob Blake showed intent to harm [as opposed to just resisting arrest] by driving the knife towards Officer Sheskey's torso.” Such an action would clearly justify deadly force.However, this gesture is not obvious in the video, at least not to me. (You can see the recording on YouTube, and move frame-by-frame using the “<” and “>” buttons on your keyboard.) That said, I wouldn’t say the video disproves these claims, either — the more important question in court, where the burden is on the prosecution — because the SUV’s door and the cops’ bodies obscure some of Blake’s movements.And at any rate, as Noble Wray’s report adds, whether> Blake drove the knife forward or not, a reasonable officer could view himself as being in imminent danger. P.O. Sheskey was literally holding on to Blake's shirt, and Blake had a knife in his hand, actively resisting, attempting to get into the vehicle. This circumstance is only compounded with the kids being in the vehicle.Of course, it was Sheskey’s own decision to grab Blake’s shirt, and there are various ways we might second-guess the officers’ actions even if we don’t prosecute them. But when it comes to those crucial final moments, the truth is that Blake put them in an impossible situation. They could have kept a safe distance from the guy with a sexual-assault warrant armed with a knife, but that would have meant letting that guy get into a vehicle they knew contained at least one child — an option that could lead to a high-speed chase or a hostage situation, both possibilities that Sheskey says he feared at the time. On the other hand, once Sheskey got close to a knife-wielding suspect, the chance he’d need to use deadly force shot way up, because knives are incredibly deadly at that range and there isn’t much time to ascertain and react to a suspect’s movements.Or, as Wray put it:> Officer Sheskey had determined that it was dangerous for the public and the child in the car to let Blake go. P.O. Sheskey felt he could not retreat once he made the decision that harm could come to the kids or to the public. I found Officer Sheskey's analysis was reasonable based on the limited information he had at the time. Officer Sheskey did not know the relationship between Blake and the child. I am not sure if it makes much difference. The U.S. Department of Justice reports in 2010 that 200,000 kids are abducted mostly by a family friend or parent. Blake's severe resistance to being taken into custody would lead a reasonable officer to believe that he would engage in a high-speed pursuit.I have no idea what actually would have happened if Sheskey hadn’t fired. I’m glad I didn’t have to make that decision myself. And I’m glad prosecutors aren’t dragging this situation out by pursuing a case they could never win.",[],https://news.yahoo.com,high

"Scottish Leaders on Trump Trip Rumors: Stay the Hell Away, Unless You’re Bringing Tax Records","Reuters/Carlo Allegri

EDINBURGH—Scotland has long prided itself on the warm welcome it gives to visitors, but that’s before a pandemic erupted around the world, and it’s never included President Donald Trump anyway.

It’s been well-documented that Trump was reviled and ridiculed in Scotland long before he got anywhere near the White House. Now, with rumors flying around that he’s plotting an escape to his flagship Scottish golf resort the day before Joe Biden’s inauguration, leaders in his ancestral homeland of Scotland are in no mood to forgive and forget. In fact, it seems there’s only one condition on which they’d welcome him—if he brings a full list of accounts to help explain his murky business dealings there.

The flight rumor originates from an article in the Scottish newspaper The Sunday Post, which quoted a source at Prestwick airport, located about 40 minutes away from the Trump Turnberry resort, saying that a U.S. presidential plane is scheduled to land there on Jan. 19. The report also states that surveillance planes have been spotted at the golf course, almost as if a very important guest is expected there sometime soon.

The country’s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, on Tuesday addressed the unverified rumors that Trump is heading to Scotland. Sturgeon, who has previously warned that Trump will face “due accountability” in Scotland if evidence is discovered proving that his Scottish golf courses have been used for money laundering and fraud, said the idea that Trump would visit during a massive coronavirus surge was unthinkable.

FM @NicolaSturgeon is asked about reports that Donald Trump could be planning to travel to Scotland.



She says travel to Scotland requires an essential purpose, and ""coming to play golf is not what I would consider an essential purpose"".

Sturgeon said she hoped Trump’s only immediate travel plans were to “exit the White House,” and the first minister added: “We are not allowing people to come into Scotland without an essential purpose right now, and that would apply to him just as applies to anybody else, and coming to play golf is not what I would consider to be an essential purpose.”

Story continues

Patrick Harvie, the co-leader of the Scottish Green Party, has had a run-in with Trump before. The future president formally accused him of blasphemy during a bizarre hearing at the Scottish parliament in 2012. Harvie has been urging the Scottish government to investigate the Trump Organization’s financial dealings in Scotland—a call which earlier this year caused Donald Trump Jr. to describe him as “irrelevant and spineless.”

“It's a relief that Donald Trump has been sent packing by the U.S. electorate, but the last place we want him running for cover is Scotland,” Harvie told The Daily Beast when asked about the rumors. “While many people would enjoy seeing Police Scotland arrest him for breaching the law on non-essential travel, it would be better for everyone if he was arrested in the U.S. for the far more serious crimes he has committed there.”

Harvie’s colleague, Ross Greer MSP, told The Daily Beast, “The only circumstance in which I'd want to see Trump in Scotland is if he's here to hand over an unvarnished set of accounts and financial disclosures for his Scottish businesses, given the pretty credible evidence submitted to the U.S. Congress linking their purchase to potential money laundering. Otherwise, he can stay stateside to sulk about his crushing defeat.”

Even Scottish lawmakers who have previously defended Trump and what his courses bring to the economy are skeptical about the rumored trip. Brian Whittle, a member of the Scottish parliament who represents the area where Trump Turnberry lies, told The Daily Beast, “The rules are that it must be essential travel only. I would hope that politicians, especially senior politicians, would lead by example. I would strongly suggest that now is not the time for President Trump to travel to Turnberry.”

Another area MSP, Colin Smyth, said that Trump and his security team landing in Scotland during a coronavirus surge would be the “height of irresponsibility,” adding, “Our police and others frankly have enough to do without the added burden of coping with Donald Trump’s election sulk... We need a categoric guarantee from both the U.K. and Scottish governments that if there is even the slightest shred of truth in these rumors they will nip this in the bud now.”

Alex Cole-Hamilton MSP told The Daily Beast, “Scotland welcomes in comers of all backgrounds and beliefs, but that stops short of providing safe harbor for criminals. We’ve got enough on our plate right now than having to deal with the arrival of a delinquent former president.”

As for the veracity of the trip rumors, it’s far from clear.

A spokesperson for Prestwick airport downplayed the speculation on Tuesday, saying, “We can confirm that we are not expecting a visit from Donald Trump in January.” The Scottish government told The Daily Beast it wasn’t currently aware of any plans for a presidential visit, and the British government’s Foreign Office, which would handle arrangements for any such trip, didn’t return a request for comment.

The Scottish government wouldn’t be drawn out on whether Trump’s visit would be considered illegal under its new lockdown rules.

Meanwhile, local plane-spotting Facebook groups are abuzz with the rumors, with some posting pictures of U.S. Navy planes flying around Prestwick—but that in itself is not unusual, the spotters say. “The American Navy have been training out of Prestwick for months,” one spotter said. Another wrote, “So much frenetic conjecture, hope he’s not coming, the sooner he retires the better, good riddance to bad rubbish.”

It has, however, been noted that Trump Turnberry has had the entire month of January booked out since November. The resort didn’t respond to a request for an explanation as to why that may be.

The White House downplayed but did not deny that there is a plan to head to Scotland. Judd Deere, deputy White House press secretary, told Fox News, “Anonymous sources who claim to know what the president is or is not considering have no idea. When President Trump has an announcement about his plans for Jan. 20, he will let you know.”

"Philippines flight attendant raped, killed at New Year’s Eve party; 11 men charged","A Philippine Airlines flight attendant died after being raped at a New Year’s Eve party — and all of the 11 men who were with her have been charged with her rape and homicide, it was revealed Tuesday.

Christine Angelica Dacera, 23, was found unconscious in the empty bathtub of her room at the City Garden Grand Hotel in Makati City early Jan. 1, The Philippine Daily Inquirer said.

INDONESIA NURSE SUSPENDED AFTER HAVING SEX WITH COVID-19 PATIENT

Friends and hotel staff raced the Filipino stewardess to a nearby hospital, where she was later pronounced dead, officials told the paper.

She initially appeared to have died from an aneurysm but police said she also had ""lacerations and sperm in her genitalia"" as well as scratches on her arms and legs.

""Based on initial investigation, sexual abuse happened,"" Philippine National Police spokesman Brig. Gen. Ilderbrandi Usana told the paper.

Makati City police on Monday filed a provisional charge of rape with homicide against 11 men who were with her during the party, the paper said. The charges are provisional as officials still await results final autopsy and toxicology results.

Three of the suspects were arrested while the others were still being hunted, Makati City police chief Col. Harold Deposita told the Daily Inquirer.

MISSING BRITISH TEEN'S DEATH IN MALAYSIA DID NOT INVOLVE OTHER PEOPLE: CORONER

""Only three of them were Dacera’s friends. The others were practically strangers to her, as they were only known to her three friends,"" the police chief said.

He told CNN Philippines that the suspects had ""conflicting"" stories — with some even saying they were gay.

But the police chief insisted that everyone in the room was equally responsible for refusing to stop the fatal rape of Dacera, who was from neighboring South Cotabato.

""They just let it happen. They could have stopped it,"" he told Balitaan, according to CNN. ""This is a classic example that an act of one is an act of all.""

The police chief insisted that ""force"" would still be to blame even if further tests confirm she had an aneurysm.

""For sure, there was force on the body. Those contusions, abrasions, that laceration … that’s not normal in intercourse,"" he told CNN.

Dacera was a flight attendant for Philippine Airlines (PAL) Express, which said it ""mourns the tragic death.""

""Our desire is for the truth to come out in the interest of justice,"" the company told the paper Tuesday.

Her mother, Sharon Dacera, appealed to President Rodrigo Duterte, saying her daughter had been ""treated like a pig"" in the ""barbaric"" crime.

""Christine does not deserve this brutality … they need to be punished,"" the grieving mom said, according to the Daily Inquirer.

A lawyer for the family, Jose Ledda, denied that the stewardess would have died from drunken, consensual sex.

""If that was consensual, or voluntary, why isn’t Christine here to answer your questions?"" he told CNN.

Officials also revealed that they are investigating the City Garden Grand Hotel, which was designated as a quarantine hotel that was barred from allowing guests to have parties, CNN said.

An Egyptian hospital is under investigation after a video showing nurses scrambling to keep COVID-19 patients alive was widely shared online,"A video showing Egyptian nurses scrambling to keep COVID-19 patients alive has been widely shared on social media.

The video, filmed by a relative of a patient, alleges that at least four people died because a hospital ran out of oxygen.

The ICU deaths are under investigation, but a local governor has denied that they were caused by a lack of oxygen.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

Egypt has launched an investigation into the death of at least four COVID-19 patients after a video showing nurses struggling to keep ICU patients alive was widely shared online, the Associated Press reported.

The video, which has been covered by several outlets including Middle East Eye and Al Jazeera, shows nurses scrambling and calling out as they run around a hospital.

In it, Ahmed Mamdouh, who filmed the video, can be heard saying, ""everyone in the ICU has died… there's no oxygen,"" Middle East Eye reported.

The governor of Sharqia province denied that was the case, according to the AP.

Gov. Mamdouh Ghorab said the patients — two women in their 60s and two men, 76- and 44-years-old — died because they had chronic diseases in addition to the virus, the AP reported.

Mamdouh didn't include evidence backing up the claim about oxygen, and the Middle East Eye reported Monday that police had summoned him for questioning.

The Sharqia prosecutor's office told the AP that it was investigating the deaths at the hospital. An anonymous official told the outlet that the hospital director and doctors were being questioned.

The allegations follow similar claims made by another family in the Menoufiya province last week.

There, a relative of a COVID-19 patient said two people had died because of a lack of oxygen at a government-run hospital, according to the AP.

Those deaths are also under investigation, the AP reported.

Egypt is in the throws of one of the largest COVID-19 spikes since the start of the pandemic last year.

The Health Ministry announced more 1,400 new cases and 54 deaths on Saturday, the AP reported. More than 144,000 cases of COVID-19 have been reported in Egypt and at least 7,918 people have died from the disease, according to Johns Hopkins University.",['Haven Orecchio-Egresitz'],https://news.google.com,high

‘Insurrection:’ Mitt Romney blames Trump as his supporters storm the U.S. Capitol,"Protesters gesture to U.S. Capitol Police in the hallway outside of the Senate chamber at the Capitol in Washington, Wednesday, Jan. 6, 2021, near the Ohio Clock. (AP Photo/Manuel Balce Ceneta)

Utah Sen. Mitt Romney was furious after protesters — fired up by President Donald Trump at a rally saying he was robbed in the election — stormed the U.S. Capitol and managed to stop the official count of the Electoral College vote, .

“This is what the president has caused today, this insurrection,” he told New York Times reporter Jonathan Martin after senators arrived at a secure location.

“This is what the president has caused today, this insurrection,” he said w fury in his voice. — Jonathan Martin (@jmartNYT) January 6, 2021

Reporter David Freedlander with Politico tweeted that Romney earlier yelled in the Senate chamber, “This is what you’ve gotten” to Ted Cruz and his colleagues who raised objections to the electoral vote counts.

Protesters managed to gain entrance eventually into the Senate chamber, and even pose in senators’ chairs. Television pictures showed protesters firing tear gas, and carrying weapons. Members of Congress were evacuated by police reportedly to secure locations.

Sen. Mike Lee urged the Senate to continue the electoral count, and not let protesters stop it.

“Congress was elected to govern. We need to get back on the floor and gavel in the Senate as soon as possible,” he tweeted.

Lee added, “Whether we get back in the chamber or convene in a different location, the Senate should continue the work of the American people immediately. This outrage cannot be allowed to disrupt that work for a minute longer.”

Rep. John Curtis, R-Utah, after noting that he and his staff were safe, condemned the violent protesters and called for Trump to do the same.

“The riots both in and outside the building are unacceptable and un-American. The President owes it to the American people to publicly call for an end to these riots,” he said.

“If this were in any other country, we would be condemning these actions and calling for their leaders to stop the violence. Those protesting say they are doing so in the best interest of America—but if that were true, they would end their assault on this sacred institution.”

That came shortly before Trump released a video on Twitter that said to protesters, “This was a fraudulent election, but we can’t play into the hands of these people. We have to have peace, so go home. We love you. You’re very special.”

Rep. Chris Stewart, R-Utah, who had joined the challenge to the election, also tweeted, “Watching and hearing what’s going on here continues to make me sick and angry. I’ve spent my life in the military and serving my country in Congress. I understand people’s fears and frustrations over the election. But nothing excuses this behavior. Its selfish and destructive. Stop it now!”

Stewart also praised Capitol Police. “I was locked in a small room with them for a couple of hours surrounded by violence and anger. They were calm and professional every moment. They represent the best our nation has to offer.”

Rep. Burgess Owens, R-Utah, who also was challenging the election results, tweeted, “My team and I are safe and beyond grateful for the service of Capitol Police.I am deeply saddened by what is happening right now. Americans are better than this. Senseless violence is NEVER okay. We have to do better.”

Rep. Blake Moore, R-Utah, tweeted, “I was evacuated from the House Floor. My team and I are safe. Appreciative of Capitol Police and their service. This saddens and troubles me greatly.”

Utah leaders outside of Congress also condemned the violent protesters.

Former Congressman Ben McAdams said he was absolutely shocked by the scene unfolding in D.C.

“It’s a sad day for our country. One of the things I learned as a schoolchild was the peaceful transition of power. We are all Americans. This is not American democracy,” said McAdams.

“President Trump needs to call to end this, to recognize he lost the election. We need the president to step forward and put the country first,” he added.

Former Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, a strong ally of Trump, said “Without any pause, caveat, or equivocation, I condemn the riots taking place at the US Capitol.”

He added in a written statement, “Enough is enough. Our institutions are undergoing a stress test that they can only survive if our elected officials show unity in this critical moment. We are a nation of laws, not individuals — and the foremost responsibility of every member of Congress is to uphold our Constitution and the integrity of the democratic process.”

Former Rep. Mia Love, R-Utah, tweeted, “The Capitol Police are some of the best individuals I know. They’re friends of mine — men and women who love their beautiful families and country. I’m praying for them and our country today. Violence is not the way.”

Salt Lake City Mayor Erin Mendenhall also tweeted, “What’s happening in the U.S. Capitol right now is disgraceful. I condemn it unequivocally. Every leader should be, in the strongest terms, calling on the White House to do everything in its power to stop this. This is not what democracy looks like; this is a national tragedy.”

The Utah Republican Party also released a statement saying in part, “The Utah Republican Party condemns this intrusion into our electoral process. Our Constitution protects the right to peacefully protest, and to engage in vigorous debates over politics and ideas, but violence or destruction in any form are an affront to who we are as Americans.”

Earlier in the day before the violence, Owens joined a group of 37 House Republicans urging others to join their challenge of electoral votes contending several states broke their own election laws.

“Proud to sign this statement alongside so many of my colleagues. We owe it to the American people to protect the integrity of our electoral system. Period,” Owens tweeted.

On the opposite end of the spectrum, Romney told reporters in Washington earlier on Wednesday that Trump has “disgraced the office of the presidency,” as the Utah senator decried the effort by some of his Republican colleagues to object to electoral college votes.

“The gambit that we’re seeing today, very disappointing,” Romney told reporters. “President Trump has disrespected the American voters, has dishonored the election system and has disgraced the office of the presidency, and I’m confident that we’ll proceed as the Constitution demands and tell our supporters the truth, whether or not they want to hear it.”

Burgess and Rep. Chris Stewart had earlier vowed to challenge of electoral votes in key states. Others in Utah’s all-GOP delegation have said directly or through spokespeople that they would not join. Romney and Sen. Mike Lee were expected to speak or make additional statements Wednesday.

The statement signed by Owens on Wednesday said, “We are convinced the election laws in certain states were changed in an unconstitutional manner” from what legislatures had set up for presidential elections “by a variety of other officials, including governors, secretaries of state, election officials, judges, and private parties.”

They added, “That usurpation of the legislatures’ sole authority, delegated by the Constitution, was a primary reason why the election of 2020 became riddled with an unprecedented number of serious allegations of fraud and irregularities.”

However, courts have repeatedly and universally dismissed cases by President Donald Trump and his allies claiming fraud for lack of evidence.

Still the group of 37 wrote that Congress “is the last bulwark in a presidential election to ensure the Constitution has been followed,” so they will challenge and vote against accepting the Electoral College results in several states.

“Taking this action today will not undermine our beleaguered institutions, as some critics charge, but rather reinforce and defend them,” the wrote. “Our support of objections will not diminish the value of the vote of any individual citizen, but rather protect that value, by ensuring the Constitution is followed.”

The group acknowledged their efforts will likely fail. Both houses would need to vote to sustain challenges to remove votes from any state, and the House is controlled by Democrats. Also, a bipartisan majority in the Senate has stated opposition to the challenge.

“In 10 years in the NFL, I played in a lot of losing games,” he said. “If you leave everything on the field and you’ve done everything you can and there’s nothing left, then it’s a winning game regardless of what the score might be.”

He added, “I plan to leave everything on the field” for Trump by helping to challenge electoral votes in states he believes Trump actually won. Owens added, “There’s no question in my mind that I think he won.”

Also this week, Stewart said he will join the challenge.

“Until we have resolved the issues surrounding voting irregularities, ballot integrity and security, and the implementation of state election laws, I cannot, in good conscience, uphold the oath I took to protect and defend our Constitution by voting to certify the election,” he tweeted.

Others in the Utah delegation have denounced the effort to try to keep Trump in office.

“The egregious ploy to reject electors may enhance the political ambition of some, but dangerously threatens our Democratic Republic,” Romney said in a weekend statement. “The congressional power to reject electors is reserved for the most extreme and unusual circumstances. These are far from it.”

He added, “Were Congress to actually reject state electors, partisans would inevitably demand the same any time their candidate had lost. Congress, not voters in the respective states, would choose our presidents. ... I could never have imagined seeing these things in the greatest democracy in the world. Has ambition so eclipsed principle?”

“I have faith in America’s election system and those who work tirelessly to ensure our elections are secure,” he wrote. “I plan to respect each state’s decision, certify the election, and continue to work with my colleagues on solutions for Utah.”

Moore said in an interview last week, “I would need to see very, very substantial evidence to challenge the Electoral College. … I have not seen that to the degree that would change the outcome of the election. So that’s where I am currently on that.”

Sen. Lee, R-Utah, has said through a spokesperson that he does not plan to join the challenge, which brought Trump’s displeasure and pressure at a political rally in Georgia this week.

“Mike Lee is here, but I’m a little angry at him,” Trump said, as supporters cheered.","['Lee Davidson', 'Jan.', 'Updated']",https://news.google.com,high
Ossoff scores victory over Perdue in Senate runoff,"Democrats’ twin victories in Georgia have huge implications for President-elect Joe Biden’s legislative agenda, as he will not be forced to navigate a Republican Senate and negotiate with Majority Leader Mitch McConnell during the opening years of his administration.

The Georgia results also represent a triumphant coda for Democrats’ 2020 campaign season, which began last year with high hopes for wresting back control of the Senate.

Instead, Democratic candidates fell short in many battlegrounds across the country, while the races for Georgia’s two Senate seats proceeded to runoffs after no candidate earned more than 50 percent of the vote in the November election.

In that election, Perdue — a former business executive and first-term senator — narrowly missed the 50 percent threshold to win reelection outright, but still ran roughly 88,000 votes ahead of Ossoff.

Since then, the two candidates have been locked in a competitive one-on-one contest, with Ossoff repeatedly attacking Perdue over the timing of his stock trades amid the coronavirus pandemic.

Ossoff leveled especially fierce criticism during an October debate, prompting Perdue to skip a subsequent televised forum in December.

For his part, Perdue frequently pointed to the fact that he earned tens of thousands of more votes than Ossoff in the November, and accused his opponent of being a “trust fund baby” with “scandalous ties” to foreign powers.

In recent weeks, however, Perdue’s reelection battle had become increasingly entangled with President Donald Trump’s own effort to reverse the outcome of the 2020 White House race.

The president’s particular interest in overturning the election results in Georgia, where he lost to Biden, complicated campaigning for Loeffler and Perdue — who both clung to Trump as he attacked Gov. Brian Kemp and other Republican state officials.

The two candidates had sought at once to defend the president’s election fraud allegations while also imploring Republican voters to return to the polls in January for their runoff races.

Perdue was also quick to express support for Trump’s bid to boost coronavirus stimulus checks to $2,000, a last-minute demand by the president that broke with the public posture of most Senate Republicans.

But after McConnell blocked the proposal, Ossoff and Warnock began campaigning on the increased payments.

More recently, the runoff races had been rocked by news reports of a call between Trump and Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, during which the president pressured the state’s top elections official to “find” enough votes to overturn Biden’s victory.

GOP lawmakers and party officials had grown increasingly anxious that Trump’s rhetoric aimed at sowing doubt about Georgia’s election processes could cost Republicans the Senate.

And in the final days before the election, Perdue was forced to abandon the campaign trail when he began quarantining after coming into close contact with an individual who tested positive for the coronavirus.

McConnell warns overruling voters 'would damage our Republic forever',"(CNN) Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell broke with President Donald Trump on Wednesday to deliver a stark warning in opposition to efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election.

""The Constitution gives us here in Congress a limited role. We cannot simply declare ourselves the national board of elections on steroids. The voters, the courts and the states have all spoken. They've all spoken. If we overrule them it would damage our republic forever,"" McConnell said in a floor speech before Trump-inspired protesters stormed the US Capitol building

The remarks from the top Senate Republican come as a joint session of Congress convened to count the Electoral College votes. A slate of Republican lawmakers are challenging the results from multiple states -- an effort encouraged by Trump that is doomed to fail, but that has divided Republicans and that members on both sides of the aisle have warned dangerously seeks to subvert the popular will of the voters.

""We're debating a step that has never been taken in American history -- whether Congress should overrule the voters and overturn a presidential election,"" McConnell said.

He continued on to say, ""President Trump claims the election was stolen. His assertions range from specific local allegations to Constitutional arguments to sweeping conspiracy theories. I supported the President's right to use the legal system. Dozens of lawsuits received hearings in court rooms all across our country, but over and over the courts rejected these claims, including all-star judges whom the President himself nominated.""

Biden to nominate Merrick Garland to be attorney general,"President-elect Joe Biden intends to nominate Merrick Garland to serve as attorney general, multiple people familiar with the decision tell CBS News.

Garland is the former chief judge on United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, considered to be the second-highest federal court in the country. Garland, 68, was nominated by former President Barack Obama to the U.S. Supreme Court after the death of Justice Antonin Scalia, but he was blocked from consideration by Republican senators.

Appeals Court Judge Merrick Garland seen in this file photo dated March 16, 2016. Reuters

Garland, who is still a judge on the appeals court, is also a veteran of the Justice Department, most notably overseeing the prosecution of Timothy McVeigh, the Oklahoma City bomber and Ted Kaczynski, better known as the ""Unabomber.""

One person familiar with the choice said that the results of Tuesday's U.S. Senate runoff elections in Georgia changed the dynamics of Mr. Biden's choice.

""Last night changed a lot,"" this person said.

Garland was chosen over other notable candidates, including former Senator Doug Jones, Democrat of Alabama, who is also a former federal prosecutor and was considered to be a front-runner, especially as Republicans maintained control of the Senate. Sally Yates, the former deputy attorney general, was also under consideration.

The Biden team will cast Garland as a nonpartisan, restorative figure to lead a department imperiled by four years of political interference by President Trump and his associates.","[""Ed O'Keefe"", 'Bo Erickson', 'Nancy Cordes']",https://news.google.com,high
"Severe allergic reactions reported in the US after getting COVID-19 vaccine, but CDC says cases are rare","Severe allergic reactions reported in the US after getting COVID-19 vaccine, but CDC says cases are rare

As more Americans continue to get vaccinated against COVID-19, U.S. officials continue to monitor for severe allergic reactions and other adverse events after getting the vaccine.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said early safety monitoring has detected 21 cases of anaphylaxis, a severe allergic reaction, after receiving the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine.

The cases were detected in a pool of 1,893,360 first doses administered from Dec. 14 to 23. This translates to 11.1 cases of anaphylaxis per 1 million doses, said Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, in a media briefing Wednesday.

This is higher than the flu vaccine, which has an average outcome rate of 1.3 cases per 1 million doses. However, Messonnier said the rate of anaphylaxis in the COVID-19 vaccine is still considered a rare outcome.

“We all would hope that any vaccine would have zero adverse events, but even at 11 cases per million doses administered – it’s a very safe vaccine,” she said.

In 86% of the cases, symptoms began within 30 minutes of vaccination, and 81% of them occurred in people with a history of allergies or allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis events. Most of the patients who reported having this severe allergic reaction – 90% – were women.

Dr. Thomas Clark, an epidemiologist at the CDC, said 19 patients used epinephrine, a medication used to treat severe allergic reactions in an emergency situation, and all of the patients whose information was available recovered.

A total of 29 cases were reported as of Wednesday and included some patients who received the Moderna vaccine, Clark said. The agency is still investigating these cases and plans to include them in a future report.

According to the CDC, about 17 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine have shipped throughout the country, shy of the 20 million federal officials promised to be distributed by the end of 2020. As of Wednesday, 4.8 million people have been vaccinated.

Anaphylaxis is a serious, life-threatening allergic reaction and requires immediate medical attention, according to the American Academy of Allergy Asthma & Immunology. Symptoms can include skin rash, nausea, vomiting, difficulty breathing and shock. The most common anaphylactic reactions are to foods, insect stings, medication and latex.

The CDC said it will continue to monitor for adverse events, including anaphylaxis, and will regularly assess the benefits and risks of vaccination. However, the COVID-19 vaccine continues to be “an important tool in efforts to control the pandemic.”

“We’re in the setting of 2,000 COVID deaths per day,” Messonnier said. “It’s still a good value proposition to get someone vaccinated. Their risk from COVID and poor outcomes from COVID is still more than the risk of a severe outcome from the vaccine.”

Trump Supporters Heckle Mitt Romney on Flight to D.C. for Electoral College Certification,"Utah Patriots catch Rino Romney at Salt Lake City international airport! He thinks he’s above his constituents!!! Openly bashing @realDonaldTrump!!!

Republican Sen. Mitt Romney got a preview of the tenor of the Trump-fueled rally that’s set to take place Wednesday in Washington when he was confronted, cellphone cameras out, by Trump supporters while traveling Tuesday from Salt Lake City back to the Capitol for the Electoral College certification. Romney, the party’s most recent pre-Trump presidential nominee, has been one of the few critics—and voices of reason—among his elected Republican colleagues, which has made him a target for outrage with Donald Trump’s most undying, unblinking supporters.

While waiting for his flight at the Salt Lake City airport, Romney, who was sitting alone reading on a tablet, was confronted by a maskless Trump supporter. Romney can be heard asking the woman to put her mask on as she approached, to which she responded: “Don’t tell me what to do.” “Why aren’t you supporting President Trump?” she demanded. “I do support the things President Trump does that I agree with,” Romney responded. “You’re not supporting him,” she countered. “Are you going to support him in the fraudulent vote …” she asked trailing off. Romney told her he would not support overturning the November election, citing the Constitution.

The woman went on to inform Romney that he works for her and the conservatives that put him in office. “I work for the people of Utah,” Romney replied, “and you’re not the only one.” He then packed his bag and stood up to walk away. “They didn’t want you in there anyways, so, to be honest with you, I wouldn’t be surprised if you weren’t even voted in legally,” the woman said as a parting shot.

Another Trump supporter arrived to join the deep constitutional debate, informing Romney that he would be primaried. “Oh trust me, you’re getting primaried, buddy,” the man said. “That’s just fine. Of course I’ll be primaried, that’s totally appropriate.” Romney replied. “You admit it, you know it, you know it’s coming,” the man said. “I was primaried last time and I’m happy to be primaried again,” Romney responded. “Trump is a juggernaut,” the man said as Romney walked away through the terminal. “Your legacy is nothing.”

The harassment continued once Romney had boarded his Delta flight to D.C. with a cohort of passengers chanting: “Traitor! Traitor! Traitor!”

National Guard heads to the Capitol to tamp down pro-Trump insurrection,"Both Washington D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's office asked for the National Guard to respond, two sources told NBC.

Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam also said he would send his state's National Guard along with 200 state troopers to the Capitol. Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan added that he told the Maryland National Guard to send a force to the federal legislature.

""We are prepared to provide additional support as necessary and appropriate as requested by local authorities,"" he said in a statement Wednesday. ""Our people are sworn to defend the constitution and our democratic form of government and they will act accordingly.""

Acting Defense Secretary Chris Miller said he coordinated with Vice President Mike Pence and congressional leaders to active the National Guard and assist officers with taking back the Capitol. He did not mention any contact with President Donald Trump .

The Washington D.C. National Guard force of about 1,100 was mobilized to help federal law enforcement tamp down the insurrection, according to chief Pentagon spokesman Jonathan Hoffman. The Department of Justice will lead the federal law enforcement response, Hoffman said.

The National Guard and state forces responded at the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday after pro-Trump rioters overran the building during the Electoral College vote count.

Trump supporters stand on the U.S. Capitol Police armored vehicle as others take over the steps of the Capitol on Wednesday, Jan. 6, 2021, as the Congress works to certify the electoral college votes.

Earlier in the week, Miller approved a request from Bowser to deploy 340 National Guard forces to the city to support local authorities during pro-Trump demonstrations scheduled across the nation's capital, according to Hoffman. The mission Miller approved directed unarmed National Guard members to help direct traffic and support local police with crowd control.

White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said the guard was ""on the way along with other federal protective services"" on Wednesday afternoon. Rep. Elissa Slotkin, D-Mich., told NBC News she spoke to Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley. She said that by sending the National Guard the government aims to ""bring the Capitol complex back under control with as little bloodshed as possible.""

Protesters spurred by Trump's calls to overturn the 2020 presidential election entered the Capitol with relative ease Wednesday afternoon despite efforts by U.S. Capitol Police to stop a surge toward the floors of the legislature. Photos from reporters in the Capitol at one point showed officers in an armed standoff behind a barricade as rioters tried to enter the House chamber.

The breach forced lawmakers, some of whom had to don gas masks to travel through clouds of tear gas, to evacuate to secure locations. As the government tried to take back control of the Capitol, an FBI swat team was among the forces entering the building, according to an NBC News video.

The breach of the Capitol stopped the formal congressional count of President-elect Joe Biden's 2020 election victory over Trump. Dozens of Republicans in Congress, backed by the president, had started to challenge state results based on unfounded accusations of widespread fraud.

Trump spoke to his supporters Wednesday and again lied that he had won the election before they descended upon the Capitol. As rioters swarmed the building, Trump tweeted, ""No violence!""

He later told his supporters to ""go home"" — even as he reiterated the election lies that brought them to siege the Capitol in the first place.

Democrats and many Republicans had urged Trump to put an end to the siege.

""I call on this mob to pull back and allow the work of democracy to go forward,"" Biden said on Wednesday afternoon.

In a joint statement, Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., called on Trump ""to demand that all protesters leave the U.S. Capitol and Capitol Grounds immediately.""

Former law enforcement and defense officials also questioned how Trump supporters broke into the Capitol when the federal government knew for weeks that rioters could descend on Washington.

""I think it's the most shocking failure of security imaginable to place the Congress of the United States at physical risk in an occupied congressional chamber because they weren't prepared to deal with it,"" Ret. Gen. Barry McCaffrey said Wednesday on CNBC's ""Closing Bell.""

On Sunday, the nation's 10 living secretaries of Defense penned an ominous warning that the U.S. military should have no role in determining the outcome of a U.S. election.

""Each of us swore an oath to support and defend the Constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic. We did not swear it to an individual or a party,"" penned Defense secretaries Mark Esper, James Mattis, Ash Carter, Chuck Hagel, Leon Panetta, Dick Cheney, William Cohen, Robert Gates, William Perry and Donald Rumsfeld in an op-ed published Sunday in The Washington Post.

The former Defense secretaries, who have collectively overseen America's military forces for nearly 50 years, argued that ""the time for questioning the results"" of the U.S. presidential election has passed.

""Our elections have occurred. Recounts and audits have been conducted. Appropriate challenges have been addressed by the courts. Governors have certified the results. And the electoral college has voted. The time for questioning the results has passed; the time for the formal counting of the electoral college votes, as prescribed in the Constitution and statute, has arrived,"" wrote the former Defense secretaries, including two that served under Trump.

The secretaries called on Trump's acting Defense Secretary Miller as well as political appointees and civil servants to ""refrain from any political actions that undermine the results of the election or hinder the success of the new team.""

Trump pressures Pence to throw out election results — even though he can't,"The process is normally an uncontroversial formality, but it has taken on larger import as dozens of Republican members of Congress prepare to contest Biden’s victory in several battleground states, citing baseless claims of widespread voter fraud and irregularities.

Trump has latched on to the Jan. 6 gambit, referencing the upcoming congressional proceedings at a Monday political rally in Georgia.

“I hope Mike Pence comes through for us,” Trump said. “Of course, if he doesn’t come through, I won’t like him so much.”

Trump also used the rally, ostensibly to promote Republicans Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue ahead of their runoffs that will decide the fate of the Senate majority, to urge reluctant Republicans to support the bid to overturn Biden’s victory.

But at lunch on Tuesday, Pence informed Trump that he didn’t think he had the power to block he certification of Biden's victory, according to two White House officials. The vice president told Trump that he planned to allow objections and possibly make his own statement on election fraud, they said.

Trump went into damage control later Tuesday evening and released a statement through his campaign denying Pence's resistance. He claimed that he and Pence are ""in total agreement that the Vice President has the power to act"" and that Pence still ""has several options under the U.S. constitution.""

The president's effort has divided the GOP, particularly those who are believed to harbor future presidential ambitions, in yet another test of their loyalty to Trump.

The vice president was also tangentially involved in a minor imbroglio Tuesday about whether he would show up on the Capitol at all Wednesday, leaving the duties to Sen. Chuck Grassley — the Senate pro tempore. However, both the vice president and Grassley’s offices moved quickly to defuse the speculation.

“We have every expectation that Pence will be there tomorrow for the joint session,"" a spokesperson for Grassley said in a statement.

Some of Trump’s boosters have also fixated on Pence’s role, arguing that he has the unilateral authority to not accept the results — and open the door for alternative slates of Trump electors instead. Rep. Louie Goehmert (R-Texas) sued Pence in a failed bid to empower the vice president to overturn the election results. That lawsuit has twice been rejected by federal courts in the past week.

At the heart of the issue is an 1887 law called the Electoral Count Act, which governs the procedures by which Congress counts electoral votes. Under the vaguely written law, Pence is required to read each state’s slate of electors alphabetically, entertaining potential challenges for each.

Under Trump’s newly embraced theory, Pence has the unilateral authority to decide whether to introduce Biden’s electors at all — and could even opt to ignore them and introduce Trump-friendly electors instead. It’s a conception of the vice president’s role that’s at odds with every election in history, and one that constitutional scholars say makes no sense given that sitting vice presidents often have a stake in the outcome of the election.

Even if Pence embraced Trump's calls, Congress has adopted rules that bind themselves to the Electoral Count Act's requirements — which require lawmakers to count electoral votes certified by the states and submitted in December. And majorities in both chambers of Congress have indicated they have no interest in overturning the results.

Trump and his allies’ effort is aimed primarily at keeping Biden’s elector total under 270, the required minimum to obtain the presidency. If enough electors were invalidated to prevent him from reaching that threshold, the election would be thrown to the House in an unusual procedure that gives each state delegation a single vote. Though Democrats have the House majority, this mechanism would favor Republicans, who control more state delegations.

"Get ready to watch Georgia count, again","A version of this story appeared in CNN's What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here

(CNN) The twin US Senate runoffs in Georgia mean everything in American government for the next two years.

But it's not clear how quickly we'll know the results. CNN took until November 13 to project Biden's victory in Georgia's presidential contest , 10 days after Election Day.

There's plenty of reason to expect a repeat. Early voting, the counting of which helped drag out the presidential results, is nearly keeping track in these special runoffs. In Fulton County, the state's most populous, the elections administrator said Monday that the early vote totals were larger for January than for November.

Republicans in the state have expressed concern that there may be a Democratic edge in the early vote totals. Which means that Republicans may need a strong showing on Election Day again.

That's where President Donald Trump's feud with Republican state officials over his own loss in the state could mean the difference in the GOP having a majority going forward.

CNN's Ethan Cohen and Caroline Tounget looked at where the lead changed as the presidential votes in the state were counted during those 10 days:

At 7:16 p.m. on Election Night, when the first significant votes were reported, Biden jumped out to an early lead with almost 62% of the vote. Only 2% of the estimated vote had been reported.

The lead bounced back and forth for the next hour, but Trump pulled ahead at 8:07 p.m., with 10% reporting.

Early Wednesday morning Biden began to gain on Trump and finally overtook him at 4:48am on Friday, November 6, according to the vote count.

Biden ultimately won by a little less than 12,000 votes.

Actually, it was 11,779. Trump's got that number burned on his brain since he specifically asked Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger in their phone call this past weekend to ""find"" one more -- 11,780 votes -- just enough to win him the election.

While legal experts and constitutionalists are wondering if there's criminal liability for Trump's pressure on state officials to change results , the other end result of his war with Georgia officials from his party could be depressed turnout when the GOP needs it most.

Gabriel Sterling, the administrator of Georgia's election systems , said at a news conference Monday that the best thing for people frustrated by the presidential results would be to vote Tuesday.

""If you're a Georgia voter, if you want your values reflected by your elected officials, I strongly beg and encourage you: Go vote tomorrow. Do not let anybody discourage you. Do not self-suppress your own vote. Do not make a self-fulfilling prophecy out of doing this. Don't let anybody steal your vote that way,"" Sterling said. ""That's what's happening if you self-suppress: You are taking away your important voice from this election.""

So much rests on the outcomes in Georgia

The economy. The size and scope of recovery efforts will be shaped by who controls the Senate. Democratic wins would likely mean more from the government, The size and scope of recovery efforts will be shaped by who controls the Senate. Democratic wins would likely mean more from the government, writes CNN's Matt Egan

""A sweep by Democrats would open the door to more powerful fiscal stimulus that the shaky economy may very well need. But it would also raise the risk of corporate tax hikes that investors despise.""

Biden's ability to govern. His ability to get the people he wants in his Cabinet and in other key roles is entirely up to the Senate. One reason we don't yet know his pick to be attorney general has got to be that Biden doesn't know if it's a Republican or Democratic majority who will be voting to confirm.

Congressional oversight and Biden. A Democratic majority will mean much less combative oversight, at least to start the Biden administration. It would also make Republican efforts to attack him over his son's previous business dealings -- Trump's top offensive in 2020 -- more difficult.

About that phone call

Since it became clear that Trump lost the election, he has been actively and openly trying to get state officials to ignore election results, a plan that was almost too brazen and anti-democratic to be believed.

What's worse than openly trying to get around election results is quietly asking state officials to change them and ""find"" new votes two months after the election you lost. What Trump does behind closed doors, it turns out, is worse than what he does in the open.

The President is laser-focused on getting around his election loss and staying in power. If you think Trump is quietly working behind the scenes on Covid, which is If you think Trump is quietly working behind the scenes on Covid, which is killing an American every 33 seconds , the transcript of this call should put you straight.

He has no interest in hearing anybody else talk. Despite the best efforts of Raffensperger, who was respectful of Trump but firm in dismissing his theories, the President dominated the conversation, and all but threatened Raffensperger and his deputy.

He learned nothing from impeachment. For those senators who defended Trump and said he'd learned his lesson and would no longer use his office to pressure people for political favors, this must be a bitter pill. That a year after he was fighting impeachment, Trump would pressure a state official for votes is proof the tiger does not shed its stripes.

Imagine all the calls we'll never hear about and the pressure put on less scrupulous officials than those in Georgia.

Aside from fearing what Trump is capable of, this is also a moment to marvel at the strength of the US system, which so far has withstood all of his anti-democratic efforts. What's not clear is if any law enforcement agency -- the FBI or t he Fulton County DA , will make a criminal case out of this. Note: Prosecutions of former presidents are possible but have not occurred in modern times. It would be divisive and time-consuming.

Electoral College vote updates: Debate suspended in Congress as protesters storm Capitol,"Debates over the Electoral College results Wednesday were halted and the U.S. Capitol was placed on lockdown as massive crowds of President Donald Trump's supporters stormed the building in protest against Congress confirming President-elect Joe Biden's victory. Vice President Mike Pence, who was presiding over the process of counting and confirming the Electoral College results, was rushed out of the Senate chamber as the crowds stormed the Capitol building. The unprecedented chaos quickly produced shocking images of rioters occupying the halls of government where U.S. officials had deliberated just hours earlier. Members of Congress were photographed wearing plastic breathing devices over their heads to protect themselves from tear gas. CNN showed an image of protester sitting at the desk of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. A handwritten note near her computer said: ""WE WILL NOT BACK DOWN."" One protester dangled from the balcony in the Senate Chamber. Reports soon emerged of injuries, including at least one person shot at the Capitol and five sent to the hospital, according to NBC News.

White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said Wednesday afternoon that the National Guard was being deployed ""along with other federal protective services."" The lockdowns and evacuations came as both chambers of Congress debated Republicans' objections to Arizona's electoral results. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., at the start of the debate, forcefully rebuked efforts from members of his own party to overturn Biden's win. ""The voters have spoken,"" McConnell said on the Senate floor. ""If we overrule them, we damage our republic forever."" Just before the proceedings began, Trump had hosted a rally outside the White House where he repeatedly, and falsely, claimed the election had been stolen from him. The president also pressured Pence to reject states' slates of electors. McConnell in his remarks explicitly rejected claims that Trump's loss to Biden was due to massive fraud, and called out his colleagues in Congress who have vowed to lodge objections to the electoral results. ""Nothing before us proves illegality anywhere near the massive scale, the massive scale that would have tipped the entire election,"" McConnell said. ""If this election were overturned by mere allegations from the losing side, our democracy would enter a death spiral. We would never see the whole nation accept an election again."" ""It would be unfair and wrong to disenfranchise American voters and overrule the courts and the states on this extraordinarily thin basis. And I will not pretend such a vote would be a harmless protest gesture while relying on others to do the right thing,"" McConnell said. ""I will vote to respect the people's decision and defend our system of government as we know it."" Those comments came as a joint session of Congress convened with the intention of counting and confirming the results of the Electoral College. Republicans were expected to object to other states as their electoral vote tallies are announced. Shortly before the joint session of Congress began at 1 p.m. ET, Pence rejected Trump's call for the vice president to unilaterally overturn the Electoral College vote, saying in a letter that he did not believe he had the authority to do so. In a tweet Wednesday afternoon, Trump lashed out at Pence, saying that he ""didn't have the courage to do what should have been done to protect our Country and our Constitution."" But as the chaos escalated, Trump tweeted a follow-up message: ""Please support our Capitol Police and Law Enforcement. They are truly on the side of our Country. Stay peaceful!"" And later, he asked ""for everyone at the U.S. Capitol to remain peaceful."" With Democrat Biden's 306 electoral votes — 36 more than needed — the process normally would be a formality. But this year, it may take days because of the doomed effort by Trump to overturn his defeat.","['Dan Mangan Kevin Breuninger', 'Dan Mangan', 'Kevin Breuninger']",https://news.google.com,high
"Why Jeff Bezos, Warren Buffett, and Jamie Dimon gave up on their venture to disrupt US healthcare","Capitalism is just a collection of human decisions. We can change it if we want to.

So the CEOs of Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway, and JPMorgan Chase walked into largest and least efficient healthcare market in the world with a plan to disrupt it—and failed to do so.

Haven, the nonprofit joint venture of the three companies, will end all operations this coming February, after three short years of operation. This development isn’t entirely unexpected, given that most of Haven’s top talent, including its CEO—doctor and high-profile healthcare researcher Atul Gawande, who led the initiative from its inception—had stepped down in the last several months.

Haven’s goal was ambitious: to lower healthcare costs, first for the three companies’ hundreds of thousands of employees, and potentially for all Americans. “We’re able to focus on creating value for families, not shareholders, since we are free from profit-making incentives and constraints,” read the organization’s statement on its now-defunct website.

The venture’s launch generated panic in the healthcare sector, with existing companies seeing it as a potential competitor. But Haven’s birth was cause for enthusiasm, too: It seemed such a formidable trio was destined to succeed despite the enormous challenges facing the US’ muddle of a medical system.

It wasn’t, however. Haven’s goals, organization, and achievements over the last three years are still murky, so it’s hard to determine what exactly led to pulling the plug. But there are hints that point to the natural limits of the venture, and more concerningly, to those of the system it sought to disrupt.

Mission: impossible

Despite the secrecy around the venture, some of what might not have worked can be attributed to its management, as STAT News has reported. A few issues—such as a lack of visible progress, difficulties retaining talent, or the choice of a CEO who, while an expert in the field, had little experience running a company—hobbled the organization’s efforts.

But other problems run deeper. These pertain to Haven’s goals, how they were set up, and whether they were ever remotely attainable.

For one thing, Haven had a mission, but never quite a strategy, as Amitabh Chandra, the director of health policy research at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government tweeted. Its goal to “create simpler, high-quality healthcare at lower costs” (as the nonprofit’s site put it) was as vague as it was ambitious—a vision, rather than a business plan.

Then there was the issue of the companies involved. Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway, and JPMorgan Chase employ a combined 1.2 million people spread around the country. This makes it an interesting test group for solutions to lower healthcare costs around the country. But that geographic diversity also created a very challenging group to serve, Brian Marcotte, the CEO of National Business Group on Health, told Christina Farr in a conversation on Second Opinion. Healthcare benefits are dependent on the location of the employee, and Haven couldn’t introduce the same programs to all local markets. Instead, it would have to set up plans wherever they had employees, without the critical mass to make it a worthwhile endeavor.

Another problem, too, reported CNBC, was a divergence of interests between the three companies, each of which is expected to continue pursuing research in healthcare solutions for its own employees.

Define disrupt

Of the individual initiatives that may have accelerated the disbanding of Haven, Amazon Care is the most prominent. An initiative for Amazon employees living in the Seattle area, it seems to offer a product in line with what might have been devised by Haven.

An additional benefit offered to employees who have signed up to get healthcare coverage from the company (through traditional insurance policies), Amazon Care allows patients to text with their clinicians, have telehealth visits, get medications delivered, and even see a nurse at home. It seeks to encourage people to make fewer expensive visits to the doctor’s office, by taking care of whatever can be managed without an in-person diagnosis or treatment.

There aren’t yet data on whether Amazon Care is successfully reducing costs—for the employer and, less straightforwardly, for employees. But in any case, its goal is more limited than Haven’s: In the short- to medium-term, Amazon Care aims to save on existing policies, which would be a welcome change, but nowhere near a disruption of the system.

Amazon Pharmacy, another healthcare initiative by Amazon, is much larger in scope. Launched in November, it’s, well, a large online pharmacy. It offers discounts (so far, only on drugs purchased without prescription), and free two-day shipping for Prime customers. But once again, it’s hard to see it as a disruption of anything—rather, it looks like Amazon entering a very lucrative business at a very opportune moment.

No cure for the tapeworm

“Healthcare is the tapeworm of the American economy,” Warren Buffett famously told CNBC in 2018, when presenting Haven. Indeed, the size of the market—fueled by costs exponentially higher than in any other country in the world—continues to expand relentlessly, and is projected to make up 20% of America’s GDP by 2028. But the results of this spending are paradoxical: Americans live shorter, less healthy lives than their peers in other countries, while suffering from an epidemic of bankruptcies related to medical issues (an estimated 66.5% of all bankruptcy filings are caused by medical expenses).

Haven never explicitly said it would try to cure the tapeworm, but it’s telling how many hoped it just might be able to do so. The bandaids introduced by Obamacare in 2009 made it obvious that the US healthcare system is unsustainable, leaving a hunger for solutions: Perhaps employers could reform what the government wasn’t able to.

According to a Haven spokesperson who spoke to CNBC, the company’s team did make progress in “piloting new ways to make primary care easier to access, insurance benefits simpler to understand and easier to use, and prescription drugs more affordable.” But all of these are small, marginal changes in a system whose cost is out of control. Even if clearer policies or transparent pricing reduced costs—which is not a given, as Chandra notes—the cumulative result would have a marginal benefit.

“Haven is yet another cautionary tale to outsiders that hope to disrupt the industry that their ambition is likely unrealistic and that solving key industry problems proves to be far more difficult than most anticipate,” says Jeff Becker, an analyst at Forrester.

By folding, Haven reduces hope in the possibility that private enterprise might fix US healthcare. And it leaves behind a loaded question: If some of the smartest, richest, most knowledgeable, well connected, and ambitious leaders in the room could not find a way to disrupt American healthcare, then who can?",['Annalisa Merelli'],https://news.google.com,high
"SolarWinds hackers accessed DOJ emails, but there's no indication they reached classified systems","SolarWinds Corp banner hangs at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) on the IPO day of the company in New York, U.S., October 19, 2018.

Hackers who tapped into government networks through SolarWinds software potentially accessed about 3% of the Justice Department's email accounts, but there's no indication they accessed classified systems, a DOJ spokesperson said in a statement Wednesday.

The DOJ Office of the Chief Information Officer learned of the hack the day of Christmas Eve, according to the statement, where agents accessed the Department's Microsoft Office 365 email environment.

""As part of the ongoing technical analysis, the department has determined that the activity constitutes a major incident under the Federal Information Security Modernization Act, and is taking the steps consistent with that determination,"" the spokesperson said. ""The department will continue to notify the appropriate federal agencies, Congress, and the public as warranted.""

On Tuesday, U.S. intelligence agencies said Russians were likely behind the breach, which impacted multiple government departments. Microsoft was also a victim of the hack, Reuters reported in December.

"Fed releases minutes from December meeting, gold price still down $40","(Kitco News) Gold remained near daily lows after the Federal Reserve released the December meeting minutes, which showed broad support for the central bank’s current bond-buying program.

During the December meeting the Fed kept rates unchanged near zero, while Chair Jerome Powell stressed that the central bank will continue its asset purchases until ""the job is well and truly done.""

The minutes from the meeting revealed that all Fed officials backed the current bond-buying pace.

“All participants judged that it would be appropriate to continue those purchases at least at the current pace, and nearly all favored maintaining the current composition of purchases,” according to minutes published Wednesday. “A couple of participants indicated that they were open to weighting purchases of Treasury securities toward longer maturities.”

The $120 billion monthly pace of purchases was said to be maintained until there was “substantial further progress” made to the central bank’s employment and inflation goals.

There was no significant reaction to the news, with gold prices edging up slightly but still remaining near their daily lows. February Comex gold futures were last trading at $1,913.80, down 2.08% on the day.

The Fed’s economic projections were updated during the December meeting, with the central bank now expecting the U.S. economy to grow 4.2% in 2021, the unemployment rate to fall to 5%, and inflation to come in at 1.8%.

There were no significant changes in the dot plot, with rates expected to remain near zero until 2023.

Powell also noted that the next four-to-six months the situation will be difficult.

“Clearly, there is going to be a need for help there,” Powell said. “We do have the flexibility to provide more accommodation … The coronavirus case numbers are so high and widespread, it seems that the impact on the economy will happen. You are seeing some slowing now and during the first quarter of next year.”

Powell added that the situation should get better in the middle of next year when people will start feeling comfortable going out and engaging in a broader level of activities. “During the second half of next year, the economy should be performing strongly,” he said.

The minutes also showed that further adjustments could be made to the bond-buying program in the future.

“Some participants noted that the committee could consider future adjustments to its asset purchases -- such as increasing the pace of securities purchases or weighting purchases of Treasury securities toward those that had longer remaining maturities -- if such adjustments were deemed appropriate,” the minutes said.","['Http', 'Www.Facebook.Com Kitconews']",https://news.google.com,high

Looking Into IsoRay's Return On Capital Employed,"TipRanks

It’s a new year, and a good time to choose new stock to line the portfolio. Investment banking giant Goldman Sachs has been watching the markets with an eye toward the long term – and a finger on pulse of the present. The firm is bullish following the passage of the COVID relief bill last month, seeing the direct income assistance of $600 per person – or $1200 for married couples – as a positive for consumers’ disposable income in the here-and-now.And with consumer spending making up some two-thirds of the US economy, and boost to that metric is seen as good for the whole. Taking the COVID relief checks into account, Goldman Sachs' chief economist, Jan Hatzius, raised his expectations for US economic growth in 1Q21 – bumping his GDP forecast from 3% to 5%.“While the income effects of the fiscal package will be very front-loaded, we expect the impact on consumer spending to be more evenly distributed throughout the year,” Hatzius noted. The economist sees current conditions – with lockdowns in place, as putting something of a damper on immediate spending, but leading to pent-up demand later in the year. With that in mind, Hatzius is predicting sequential gains in Q2 and Q3, and full-year GDP growth of 5.8%, up 9% from his previous estimate.The stock analysts at Goldman are keen to follow Hatzius’ lead, and they’ve been combing the market for stocks that are likely to gain as the markets take a long-term rising trajectory. The firm's analysts are pulling the trigger on two stocks in particular, noting that each has the potential to deliver double-digit gains in the year ahead. We ran the two through TipRanks’ database to see what other Wall Street's analysts have to say about them.17 Education & Technology (YQ)The worldwide pandemic had one effect that could never have been predicted in advance: the sudden shift of schools to mass online classes. Remote office work has been around for a long time, and at the secondary and college levels, schools have had long experience with correspondence courses – but mass online learning, even down to the primary level, had never been attempted. Companies like 17 Education, however, take up the challenge of online learning.17 Education is a Chinese company, dedicated to joining technology with high-quality educational content to create more effective and efficient tutoring services for K-12. The program includes both online and in-classroom solutions – 17 Education bills itself as a full-service educational technology provider.It is also a new company to the financial markets. YQ stock went public just this past December, when trading commenced on the 4th of the month. The IPO opened flat, with shares priced at $10.50, the midpoint of the pre-IPO range. By December 9, the share price had nearly doubled. Since then, however, the stock is down 34% from its peak.Among the bulls is Goldman analyst Christine Cho, who initiated her coverage of YQ with a Buy rating and a $21 price target. This figure indicates a 55% upside for the next 12 months. (To watch Cho’s track record, click here)Cho is bullish on the company’s application of big data systems to analyze and streamline classroom solutions, and sees its unique ‘hybrid’ model of combining in-school and online courses as a net plus. “We see [YQ] translating into two potential advantages for its AST [after school tutoring] business: (1) proprietary school-level insights enabling YQ to develop more localized/customized content, and (2) ability to grow paid enrollments rapidly at a low student acquisition cost — a key challenge in the online AST industry — through penetration of organic in-school MAUs…” The Goldman review is one of two on record for 17 Education; the other is also a Buy, making the consensus view a Moderate Buy. The stock is priced at $13.5, and the $20.50 average price target gives an upside potential of ~52%. (See YQ stock analysis on TipRanks)ChampionX Corporation (CHX)17 Education wasn’t the only new ticker to hit the markets at the height of the pandemic, rather, it was one of many. ChampionX is an oilfield technology company that conducted a major change in 1H20. It’s namesake, ChampionX Holdings, merged with Apergy Corp, with the combined company attaching the ChampionX name to the new partner’s trading history. CHX started trading in June 2020, and in December, the company moved its ticker from the NYSE to the NASDAQ.CHX offers a range of oilfield tech solutions, including such specialized applications as drilling fluid and mud additives, fracturing fluid systems, and well cementing, in addition to drilling technologies. These tech services are essential for the oil producers – that own the wells – to get the product to the surface. The essential nature of the service, plus the generally improving economic conditions, led to a Q3 sequential gain in revenues of 112%. The top line came in at $633 million.Analyst Angie Sedita, who covers this stock for Goldman, sees the company in an advantageous position.“We view ChampionX as a strong oilfield service and equipment provider with a global footprint and favorable product mix. Its primary businesses, chemicals and artificial lift, are exposed to the production phase of the life of a well, thus producing lower earnings cyclicality and stronger through-cycle EBITDA. The recent merger of the two companies completed in Q2-20 (Apergy and ChampionX) should drive market share growth and cross-selling opportunities both in the international and U.S. markets,” Sedita wrote.To this end, Sedita initiated coverage on CHX with a Buy rating and a $21 price target. Her target implies a 20% upside for the next 12 months. (To watch Sedita’s track record, click here)All in all, six of Wall Street’s analysts have reviews CHX shares, and 5 said to Buy against 1 who rated it a Hold. This puts the analyst consensus at a Strong Buy. However, the recent share appreciation has pushed the stock price above the average price target of $17.10.

"Dow, S&P 500 close higher, but pro-Trump protests weigh on gains","NEW YORK (Reuters) -The Dow and the S&P 500 ended higher, soaring to all-time highs on Wednesday, as investors piled into financial and industrial stocks on bets a Democratic sweep in Georgia would lead to more fiscal stimulus and infrastructure spending.

But Wall Street pared earlier gains and the Nasdaq index closed lower after swarms of protesters stormed the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday as they sought to force Congress to undo President Donald Trump’s election loss to Joe Biden. Lawmakers evacuated after Trump supporters breached the building as police officers stood watch. Some police responded with drawn guns and tear gas.

“It hasn’t been a sharp market drop. There have been buyers coming in as well. This is a bit shocking visually to see this unfold on television,” said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment strategist at Inverness Counsel in New York.

Before the pro-Trump protests, financials hit a 1-year high and were still higher on the day, while materials, industrial and energy sectors held their gains.

Rate-sensitive bank shares also rose, tracking a surge in the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yield above 1%. [US/]

The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 437.8 points higher, or 1.44%, to 30,829.4, the S&P 500 gained 21.28 points, or 0.57%, to 3,748.14 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 78.17 points, or 0.61%, to 12,740.79.

Democrats won one U.S. Senate race in Georgia and led in another, moving closer to a surprise sweep in a former Republican stronghold that would give them control of Congress and the power to advance President-elect Joe Biden’s policy goals. A final outcome is not expected until later on Wednesday.

As this developed, U.S. Vice President Mike Pence opened a joint session of Congress to formally certify Democratic President-elect Joe Biden’s victory, rejecting President Donald Trump’s demand that he unilaterally reject electoral votes.

A Democrat-controlled Senate, meanwhile, typically ushers in increased fiscal spending while raising the chances of tax hikes and tougher regulation, and would be a net positive for economic growth globally and thus for most risk assets.

“People are focused on the stimulus that will come,” said Tom Martin, senior portfolio manager, at GLOBALT Investments in Atlanta. “The question is how big will that be and what would be contained in it. But anytime you have additional money to be spent, that’s a positive for the markets.”

The Russell 1000 value index, which is heavily weighted toward cyclical sectors, rose 2.5%, while the growth index, with a large tech company weighting, was down 1.1%.

Increased risk of antitrust scrutiny of Big Tech pressured shares of companies, with Apple Inc, Microsoft Corp, Amazon.com Inc, Google-parent Alphabet Inc and Facebook Inc falling.

Tesla Inc was the only major technology stock trading 2.9% higher at $755.98.

The small-cap Russell 2000 index jumped 4% after earlier hitting a record high.

Hopes of a vaccine-powered economic recovery in 2021 pushed Wall Street’s main indexes to record highs in late-December, with sectors that had previously lagged, including banks, industrials and energy, fueling the rally.

AmerisourceBergen Corp gained 8.6% after the U.S. drug wholesaler said it would buy Walgreens Boots Alliance’s drug distribution business for $6.5 billion to expand in Europe. Dow component Walgreens rose 4.5%.

Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.72-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.64-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

The S&P 500 posted 89 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 318 new highs and 9 new lows.

Shake out your white tablecloths because Viennetta's coming back,"Photo : PR Newsfoto/Unilever ( Other

Viennetta. Just the name alone should evoke images of grandeur, decadence beyond compare, white tablecloths, and dinner party mysteries. And also, hilarious over-the-top commercials for ice cream shaped like loaf.



I mean, come on. This is a good commercial. The intrigue. The sultry glances. That over-the-top crackling sound effect the serving knife makes when it touches the chocolate.

And now it’s back! The news of its revival was buried quietly in a press release, and if you blinked, you might have missed it. But you should go out and buy one to celebrate.

For you young’uns who might not know what I’m talking about, Viennetta, while frequently described as an ice cream cake, has no cake in it at all. It’s ice cream that’s shaped sort of like a brick of meatloaf, with layers of magic shell-like icing layered in, creating a crackling effect while you eat it. Some of the layers are squiggly like lasagna noodles, making it an airy dairy delight. By today’s standards, this ice cream novelty might not have the same as a Blasted Shake’em Bake’em Laser Blasted Macho Ice Cream Blammo Freeze sort of thing, but the commercials were most of the fun.

While the original version was made by Breyers, which already used to position itself as a premium ice cream with a simple list of ingredients, this revived version is going to be manufactured by Good Humor. I hope that doesn’t take the glamour out of it.

Man. I’ve only had Viennetta once or twice in my life, and boy did it feel special when I was a kid. I had it at my friend Ryan’s house. I don’t think I actually had the guts to ask my parents to buy any because it felt too fancy for Little Dennis. No longer. I’m an adult Dennis now, and I can buy fancy ice creams whenever I feel like it! And I’ll wear a fuckin’ tuxedo while I’m eating it!

By the way, is it just me, or is the pandemic fueling the resurgence of a lot of throwback-based food? Like the return of 3D Doritos, Totino’s pizza stuffers, and the McRib, for example. I’m sure there’s more I’m forgetting. Because if it is, keep bringing back the oldies, especially if you’re gonna haul Viennetta out of the vault, because some of you are probably shouting at your screens right now.",[],https://news.google.com,high
WhatsApp gives users an ultimatum: Share data with Facebook or stop using the app,"WhatsApp, the Facebook-owned messenger that claims to have privacy coded into its DNA, is giving its 2 billion plus users an ultimatum: agree to share their personal data with the social network or delete their accounts.

The requirement is being delivered through an in-app alert directing users to agree to sweeping changes in the WhatsApp terms of service. Those who don’t accept the revamped privacy policy by February 8 will no longer be able to use the app.

Share and share alike

Shortly after Facebook acquired WhatsApp for $19 billion in 2014, its developers built state-of-the-art end-to-end encryption into the messaging app. The move was seen as a victory for privacy advocates because it used the Signal Protocol, an open source encryption scheme whose source code has been reviewed and audited by scores of independent security experts.

In 2016, WhatsApp gave users a one-time ability to opt out of having account data turned over to Facebook. Now, an updated privacy policy is changing that. Come next month, users will no longer have that choice. Some of the data that WhatsApp collects includes:

User phone numbers

Other people’s phone numbers stored in address books

Profile names

Profile pictures and

Status message including when a user was last online

Diagnostic data collected from app logs

Under the new terms, Facebook reserves the right to share collected data with its family of companies.

Advertisement

“As part of the Facebook family of companies, WhatsApp receives information from, and shares information with, this family of companies,” the new privacy policy states. “We may use the information we receive from them, and they may use the information we share with them, to help operate, provide, improve, understand, customize, support, and market our Services and their offerings.”

In some cases, such as when someone uses WhatsApp to interact with third-party businesses, Facebook may also share information with those outside entities.

A lack of transparency

The move comes a month after Apple started requiring iOS app makers, including WhatsApp, to detail the information they collect from users. WhatsApp, according to the App Store, reserves the right to collect:

Purchases

Financial information

Location

Contacts

User content

Identifiers

Usage data and

Diagnostics

A WhatsApp spokeswoman declined to speak on the record about the changes and precisely how or if it’s possible for users to opt out of them. She agreed to email additional information on the condition it be kept on background, meaning none of the details can be quoted verbatim.

The move, the spokeswoman said, is part of a previously disclosed move to allow businesses to store and manage WhatsApp chats using Facebook's infrastructure. Users won't have to use WhatsApp to interact with the businesses and have the option of blocking the businesses. She said there will be no change in how WhatsApp shares provides data with Facebook for non-business chats and account data.

Together, the WhatsApp privacy policy and terms of service are more than 8,000 words long and are filled with legal jargon that makes it difficult for non-lawyers to understand. WhatsApp is doing its users a disservice by not agreeing to speak on the record so that reporters can fully understand the changes and explain them to readers.

People who object to the new terms and policy should consider using a different messenger. The Signal messenger provides the same robust encryption engine with a much more transparent privacy policy and terms of service. (Those documents are half the length of those from WhatsApp, too.) Besides providing encrypted chats, Signal also offers encrypted audio and video calls.

Next-Gen Assassin's Creed Reportedly Releasing Next Year,"✖

A proper next-gen Assassin's Creed game on PS5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S is reportedly releasing next year. Adding to this, the new report, claims that Ubisoft will use 2021 to focus on Assassin's Creed Valhalla, which will be primarily bolstered with two separate single-player expansions. That said, while 2021 won't feature a new Assassin's Creed game, 2022 reportedly will, and its development will be helmed by Ubisoft Sofia, the company's Bulgarian studio.

Ubisoft Sofia isn't known as one of Ubisoft's lead studios, with the bulk of its existence since it was founded in 2006 being primarily a support studio and a studio that works on handheld games. However, it has served as the lead studio behind two Assassin's Creed games: Assassin's Creed Rogue and Assassin's Creed III: Liberation.

As for the report, it comes the way of French streamer and YouTuber xj0nathan, who doesn't divulge much else of consequence other than the aforementioned information. The big thing with Assassin's Creed games, at least in the modern era, is the setting. Right now, there's no word from any reputable source where the game will be set, but there have been some dubious rumors pointing towards the series heading to China, or more specifically, ancient China.

Of course, not only should these rumors be taken with a massive grain of salt, but take all of the other information with a grain of salt. Not only is all of the unofficial variety, but it's vague enough that it's unclear what is scoop and what is speculation.

Netflix won't work on Nintendo's Wii U and 3DS after June 30th,"Netflix will stop streaming to Nintendo 3DS and Wii U devices later this year. In a support document spotted by Eurogamer, Nintendo says the company will discontinue support for the two consoles on June 30th, 2021 (coincidently, that’s the same day Minecraft Earth is set to shutdown). Netflix has already removed its app from the eShop, making it impossible to download unless it’s already associated with your account. If you have the software installed on your console, you can continue to use it to stream content from Netflix until the end of June. Afterward, you’ll need to look to other options if the Wii U or 3DS is your primary way of accessing the platform.

Who is this shutdown likely to affect? Probably the same desperate souls accessing Pornhub through their 3DS and Wii U. It’s more people than you might think, but far from a significant number. More than anything, the move is likely to highlight the fact you still can’t download Netflix on the Nintendo Switch, even though it’s far more popular than the Wii U and better suited to mobile watching than the 3DS.",[],https://news.google.com,high
"How Do We Feel About The Huge Wing On This 1,200 HP Lamborghini?","Photo : Zyrus Engineering

I don’t know about you, but when a tuning company takes a car that’s already quite fast and expensive and makes it even faster and more expensive , I tend to lose interest pretty quickly. However, something caught my eye about the Lamborghini Huracán-based Zyrus LP1200 Strada. I wonder what it could have been?



Of course, what I’m alluding to is the LP1200 Strada’s monstrous rear wing, which is so large it looks like it could comfortably seat two. But that wing is hardly the car’s only quality that could be described as monstrous.

As the name hints, Zyrus’ Huracán boast s 1,200 horsepower thanks to the addition of twin turbochargers to its 5.2-liter V10. Elsewhere, carbon-ceramic brakes, an Xtrac racing gearbox and Öhlins suspension are tasked with reining in those raging bulls and putting that power to good use. In total, the Norwegian engineering firm says it replaced more than 600 parts of the donor Huracán LP640-4 as part of the transformation.

Despite all of these track-minded enhancements and the mile-wide wing, the LP1200 Strada is street legal, just as advertised. Zyrus is making 12 of them, and at $732,000 they won’t even be quite as expensive as you might guess.

Back to that wing, though. I think the real reason the LP1200 Strada captured my attention is because the rear third reminds me of so many late ’90s GT1 cars, particularly ones like the McLaren F1 GTR Longtail that were lengthened with additional bodywork after having already rac ed for several years.

In this era, GT1 was a perfect mix of roadgoing hypercar and purpose-built prototype. If the class were still continuing today in a similar guise, cars like the LP1200 Strada, I have a hunch, are what we’d see bearing down the Mulsanne. And, since you’re asking — yeah, I’d be into that.

Incidentally, the timing for such a revival is just right, as we’re on the brink of two new top classes in global sports car racing, one of which is centered on hypercars that more closely evoke manufacturer s’ production vehicles. In 2019, Lamborghini publicly flirted with the idea of sending a hypercar to compete for the overall win at the 24 Hours of Le Mans. Then last June it trotted out the Essenza SCV12, which isn’t eligible for such racing but definitely looks as if it should be.

At this point, I wouldn’t bet on a factory-backed, global endurance program from Lamborghini. I f nothing else, cars like the one Zyrus has built, and that SCV12, give us ideas of what such an effort might ha ve looked like.",[],https://news.google.com,high
Looking Glass says it can turn any photo into a hologram,"Holographic displays aren’t much use unless you have something to look at, and Looking Glass Factory thinks it has a simple solution: turn your existing photos into holograms. The company is winding down its crowdfunding campaign for its Portrait display by announcing a cloud-based service that aims to turn any 2D photo into a hologram you can see on the upcoming screen. You just have to send in a picture and a machine learning system will create a depth map that (hopefully) turns it into a holographic wonder.

How One Modder Discovered Nintendo's Most Advanced Miis Hiding in Zelda: Breath of the Wild,"After two generations at the centre of Nintendo’s consoles, Miis seemingly took a back seat for Switch. You can still design a Nintendo-themed avatar on the handheld hybrid system, but Nintendo games support them far less frequently, with token appearances in Mario Kart 8 Deluxe or Super Smash Bros. Ultimate their most notable appearances. It led many to believe the age of the Mii was over, but a new discovery seems to show that Miis are secretly at the heart of one of Nintendo’s most beloved Switch games – The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild

see deal The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild - Wii U $59.88 on Walmart

On January 4, Mii modder HEYimHeroic posted a discovery that seemed to confirm that Mii-like parameters had been used to create NPCs in Breath of the Wild, by using modding to inject custom Miis’ details into the game and seeing their familiar cartoon faces rendered as Hylians in Breath of the Wild’s art style. Those results seem to prove that Breath of the Wild’s NPCs are a form of advanced Mii - a point the game’s code helps support by referring to them as ‘UMiis’.



Hi, Mii expert here. Turns out, the NPCs in TLoZ:BotW use an advanced version of the Mii format. This means that with modding, you can inject Miis into the game. :) Thinking about opening commissions for Mii injects, both screenshot/images of your Mii and mod downloads! pic.twitter.com/8NfVr4zyqA



— i'm alice (@HEYimHeroic) January 4, 2021

Have you played The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild? YES NO

HEYimHeroic has been researching Miis for around a year, starting the in-depth Wii Facts Plus Twitter account and a library of all Nintendo-created Miis along the way. Speaking to me over Twitter, they explain that the Breath of the Wild modding community had theorised that Miis could be related to Breath of the Wild’s NPCs since shortly after the game launched, even finding the term UMii related to NPCs when combing the game’s files. However, that search seemed to have died down in the intervening years: “The modders I've spoken to assumed that it was only just a name, after a while, and that was pretty much where the similarities ended,” explains HEYimHeroic. “No one had ever actually attempted to port Miis into the game... and I did that out of sheer curiosity!”

The breakthrough was in realising that UMiis share ID values for parts of their construction with traditional Miis: “Every type of mouth, eyes, hair, etc. all have a certain ID value attached to them with Miis. The big thing here is that UMiis also share the exact same ID values, so this part's probably the easiest - just copy and paste the ID value from the Mii into the UMii!” HEYimHeroic then discovered that Mii colour values are drawn from altered Wii U versions of the avatars, rather than the original Mii Studio and (with an anonymous friend’s help) discovered how to convert and assign those properly. Mii sizing is one of the more confusing elements, with existing values not always corresponding with how they turn out within Breath of the Wild. “More testing is needed,” explains the modder, “but we know enough about them to port Miis in most of the time!”

“ HEYimHeroic thinks Nintendo used, “a manual creation tool, like Mii Maker. Or, maybe... UMii Maker?”

The upshot was that, on December 30, HEYimHeroic managed to inject their own Mii design into the game and - with the help of a Breath of the Wild modding server - managed to create a UMii version of an existing Mii. “Looking back, now that I know more about the format,” they explain, “I definitely could've improved more, but at the time, it was more than enough to convince people that Miis and UMiis aren't that different after all.”

What HEYimHeroic had discovered was that - aside from key characters like Link and Zelda - Nintendo had seemingly used the UMii system to create every NPC in the game. While non-humanlike races such as Gorons use a very limited set of variable, human-like races Hylians and Sheikah use many of the same kinds of backend values as Miis in their creation. Every NPC appears to be custom-built, rather than generated, which HEYimHeroic thinks means Nintendo used, “a manual creation tool, like Mii Maker. Or, maybe... UMii Maker?”



also, here are the full screenshots of the four Miis i posted in that main tweet. pic.twitter.com/lAYScS43eF — i'm alice (@HEYimHeroic) January 4, 2021

If a formal UMii Maker does exist, its differences from the classic Mii Maker are as interesting as its similarities. For example, the option to add moles to Miis aren’t supported for UMiis, and not all Mii hairstyles are replicated (although the game will automatically convert an unsupported hairstyle into a similar one). “Glasses size, position, and mustache position are also all removed,” adds HEYimHeroic. “These values are no longer manually set, but the game automatically determines them based on the rest of the face. For example, if you move the mouth lower on the face, then the mustache will be automatically moved lower on the face, too.”

Despite those changes, there appears to be far more nuance to how a UMii can be created when compared to a Mii. “This is easily the most intricate usage of Miis yet,” explains HEYimHeroic when I ask if this is the most advanced version of Mii they’ve discovered. “In fact, it's so complex, it's hard to still call them ‘Miis’ anymore. Depending on how strict your definition of what a ‘Mii’ is, you could say these aren't even Miis at all! Previously, I thought the most interesting use of Miis was actually in Super Mario 3D Land, of all games, where some levels you get are based on your Mii’s favorite color. But this takes the cake!”

“ This is easily the most intricate usage of Miis yet. In fact, it's so complex, it's hard to still call them ‘Miis’ anymore.

At time of writing, many of the new features for creating NPCs remain unknown, but HEYimHeroic is on a quest to document them. “For example,” the modder explains, “there's about 4 more values that only exist to control the NPC's pupils. [And] there's only 12 favorite colors Miis support, but I've seen UMiis go up to 14, possibly higher! [...] There are a lot more color options than the game's currently letting on, so I'd really like to dig into those. Also figuring out some of the unknown values (like the 4 pupil values) would really allow for editing the subtle details, that would really add to the magic of the UMiis.”

There’s a long way to go, but there appears to be no doubt that UMiis are indeed a step beyond the Miis we know. Which begs the question - is it possible we could see UMiis used in other Nintendo games, or even get to create them ourselves in a non-modding context? HEYimHeroic has bad news on that front:

“Most likely, no. Well, we might see UMiis return in Breath of the Wild's sequel... but as far as completely different games go? No. There's way too [much] BotW-specific stuff here, it's difficult to imagine that UMiis were made for a ‘general use’ sort of deal. In fact, we believe the name ‘UMii’ stems from [Breath of the Wild’s] internal name found in the files: UKing. So, the name ‘UMiis’ might literally mean ‘Breath of the Wild Miis’, but there's not a way to know for sure on that one!”

Loading

If that’s the case, what about Miis in general? What does the world’s now most notable Mii modder see as the future of Nintendo’s increasingly invisible mascots?

“Before finding all of this, I wouldn't have given you a very optimistic answer. But that was because I didn't even know Nintendo was willing to transform Miis like this! I have a good feeling Miis will at least make an appearance on the next platform, but I can tell Nintendo's running out of reasons for them to stay, which is very unfortunate. However, as long as they're willing to make things like UMiis that have plenty of Mii DNA in their files, I'll be able to find workarounds eventually, and get Miis into games that shouldn't even have them. At least then, we still have Miis in some form.”

Even if we are looking at the final piece of Mii evolution, this feels like something of a fitting tribute. Miis represent so much of Nintendo’s recent past, becoming the friendly face of Nintendo gaming for well over a decade, and becoming icons in the process. They’re as much a part of the company’s visible history as Mario or Link themselves. It seems only fair, then, that they make up an integral (if almost invisible) piece of perhaps Nintendo’s greatest game of that same period.

MILEY CYRUS Taps ELTON JOHN For Cover Of METALLICA's 'Nothing Else Matters',"Miley Cyrus has collaborated with Elton John on a cover of METALLICA's ""Nothing Else Matters"".

The pop star discussed the project during an appearance on the U.K. radio show ""Capital Breakfast With Roman Kemp"". She said: ""I did a METALLICA cover of 'Nothing Else Matters' featuring Elton John on piano. I've got Yo-Yo Ma, Chad Smith — so many all-stars.

""I'm so excited about this collaboration. Andrew Watt produced it, and I'm really stoked. I mean, having Elton John and METALLICA and me — I love it when ingredients don’t quite fit.""

Cyrus previously said she was working on an album of METALLICA covers last October.

A year earlier, Miley performed her version of ""Nothing Else Matters"" at U.K.'s Glastonbury festival.

Cyrus's rendition of the METALLICA classic — which can be heard below — came five months after drummer Lars Ulrich said that he was ""stunned"" by her take on TEMPLE OF THE DOG's ""Say Hello 2 Heaven"" at the ""I Am The Highway: A Tribute To Chris Cornell"" concert at the Forum in Los Angeles.

Back in January 2019, Ulrich took to his Instagram to post a photo of him backstage with Cyrus, along with the message: ""Still stunned by your next level version of 'Say Hello 2 Heaven' for Chris! Beyond inspiring.""

'Mr. Mayor' wisely elects Ted Danson to play TV's latest bumbling politician,"(CNN) Ted Danson has a way of classing up even a so-so premise, and so it is with ""Mr. Mayor,"" a new sitcom from the ""30 Rock"" tandem of Robert Carlock and Tina Fey. Returning to NBC fresh off ""The Good Place,"" the show allows its star to cut loose as L.A.'s unlikely new mayor, which is a pretty good place to start.

Granted, the bumbling-politician-and-his-eccentric-staff framework generally feels like a slightly warmed-over version of ""Veep,"" minus nonstop swearing. There's also a dollop of heart associated with Danson's Neil Bremer, a retired billboard tycoon, who ran in order to impress his teenage daughter (Kyla Kenedy) -- a sitcom-style subplot the show could probably have done without.

That disclaimer aside, Danson is quite funny in places as the proverbial fish out of water, mystified by the demands of a job that he impulsively sought after the previous mayor abruptly quit. That bit of history might be the show's most clever stroke, explaining away its absence of Covid-19 protocols in the process -- a joke made slightly uncomfortable by news that production was temporarily shut down due to coronavirus.

Premiering with back-to-back half-hours, the first episode dutifully sets up the concept and characters, among them Bremer's harried chief of staff (""Crazy Ex-Girlfriend's"" Vella Lovell), who wonders what she's gotten herself into; and a holdover from the previous administration (""SNL"" alum Bobby Moynihan), basically kept around to have someone to throw under the bus if things get bad.

Much of the conflict, meanwhile, stems from a City Hall veteran, Arpi (Holly Hunter, punching well below her acting weight), who resents having this newcomer in office.

Focus Features has announced that its buzzy Oscar hopeful Promising Young Woman will release digitally for VOD rentals beginning Jan. 15, just under one month after the Emerald Fennell-directed film released in theaters over the holiday season.

The film — which received enthusiastic critical reviews upon its debut at the 2020 Sundance Film Festival — follows Mulligan as Cassie, a medical school dropout who avenges a classmate's sexual assault by luring toxic men into a web of physical and psychological torture while balancing a budding romance with a local charmer (Bo Burnham) of her own.

""Emerald describes it as a beautifully wrapped piece of candy, but when you suck on it, you realize it's poisonous,"" Mulligan previously told EW of the ensemble film's tone, which combines elements of dark comedy, rape-revenge thriller, and even includes a bonkers musical moment set to ""Stars Are Blind"" by Paris Hilton. ""Audiences will love it because it's so much fun. It's dark and challenging, but not in a boring, didactic way. You'll go have socially distanced supper [after watching], sit, and fight about it,"" she finishes. ""You want a film that people talk about in years to come, not something that gets lost in the sea of awards season films.""

Following its Christmas debut in select theaters, Promising Young Woman has grossed just under $2 million at the domestic box office on top of generating significant buzz on social media.

Alec Baldwin remains 'supportive' of wife Hilaria Baldwin amid fallout from heritage scandal,"Alec Baldwin is doing his best to keep his embattled wife Hilaria Baldwin in high spirits despite the onslaught of criticism she's received over the past week for allegedly ""pretending"" to be Spanish.

The yoga expert, 36, is at the center of a scandal after it was revealed that she was actually born and raised in Boston, not Spain as she has implied.

The mother of five has been quiet on social media in the last few days. A source tells People magazine that she and Alec rang in the new year in the Hamptons.

As she reportedly remains ""upset"" about the backlash, the insider claimed the ""30 Rock"" star ""has been around to comfort her.""

""He has been supportive and has tried to cheer her up,"" the insider continued.

Meanwhile, one of Hilaria's ""close"" friends told the magazine that the scandal has been surprising.

""She loves speaking about her Spanish heritage and seemed to want people to believe that she is Spanish,"" the friend said.

Hilaria's pal added that Hilaria wants her five children -- whom she refers to as ""Baldwinitos"" on social media -- to ""know that they are half-Spanish."" ""It's been important to her that the kids speak Spanish. And they all have Spanish names.""

HILARIA, ALEC BALDWIN 'VERY UPSET' OVER HERITAGE CONTROVERSY: REPORT

The trouble began for the Baldwin family last month when a Twitter user fired off a since-deleted tweet that read, ""You have to admire Hilaria Baldwin’s commitment to her decade long grift where she impersonates a Spanish person.""

The online message sparked sleuths to dig into Hilaria's background and to discover that despite previous claims, she was not born in Spain, but in Boston. She had previously claimed on a podcast in April 2020, ""I moved here [to America] when I was 19 to go to NYU from… my family lives in Spain, they live in Mallorca.""

The bilingual mother of five's accent has also noticeably fluctuated over the years when she made appearances on TV. In one damning clip from the ""Today"" show, she appears to forget the English word for ""cucumber.""

BILLY BALDWIN, WIFE CHYNNA PHILLIPS ADDRESS HILARIA BALDWIN’S SPANISH HERITAGE SCANDAL

Alec had even made similar claims, once stating on David Letterman in 2013 that ""my wife is from Spain.""

Hilaria addressed the criticism online in a video. ""There have been some questions about where I’m born, I’m born in Boston … I spent some of my childhood in Boston, some of my childhood in Spain, my family, my brother, my parents, my nephew, everybody is over there in Spain now, I’m here,"" she explained.

Then, in speaking to the The New York Times, Hilaria called the viral controversy ""surreal"" and said there are misconceptions about how she's presented herself.

""There is not something I’m doing wrong, and I think there is a difference between hiding and creating a boundary,"" Hilaria said.

Speaking in her latest interview, Baldwin blames false reporting and says she has never actively misrepresented her heritage.

"Presser Bullets: Kerry Coombs, Shaun Wade, Ohio State Defense Preparing for Challenge of Alabama’s Offense","Ohio State had a massive challenge on its hands facing Trevor Lawrence, Travis Etienne and Clemson’s electric offense in the Sugar Bowl.

And now the Buckeyes will face an even bigger test on Monday night, squaring up against Heisman Trophy winner DeVonta Smith and two more Heisman finalists in Alabama quarterback Mac Jones (who finished third in the voting) and running back Najee Harris (who finished fifth).

How will the Buckeyes handle that high-powered unit? Will they have to prepare for the return of receiver Jaylen Waddle?

Kerry Coombs, Shaun Wade, Jonathon Cooper, Haskell Garrett, Justin Hilliard, Pete Werner and Marcus Williamson took to the podium on Wednesday to answer those questions and more. A bullet-point rundown of what they discussed:

Kerry Coombs

Coombs called this season ""the most rewarding year"" because of the players' willingness and ability to adapt to the adversity that's happened and having an eagerness to do ""whatever it takes"" to have a successful season.

On the challenge of Alabama's offense: ""This is a great offense. It is a complete offense. They have five All-Americans, a Heisman Trophy winner and a runner-up.""

He says the Tide not only have great players but a great scheme, and they ""always have an answer.""

Details such as hand placement on the inside of offensive linemen and filling gaps is imperative for Ohio State's defensive line, Coombs says.

On Lathan Ransom's increased role: ""He's just continued to improve every day. ... Those are the types of kids that suffer from the structure of the way the summer went and the shortened season."" He says Ransom was doing well in practice and he's continued to improve and develop: ""We're excited for his future.""

Coombs believes the Buckeyes' offense had ""a completely different feel to the passing game"" once Ryan Day took over. Said Day is ""very, very creative in what he does with the passing game"" and that the feeling was tangible that it was beginning to change from the moment he arrived.

Coombs praised Day's leadership of this team: ""He's a players coach. ... He talks to the players all the time. That's one of his greatest gifts.""

Day gives the coaching staff suggestions on what to read and watch that don't have anything to do with football and more so on how to treat the young players on their team.

Coombs was on staff for the Buckeyes' Sugar Bowl win over Alabama at the end of the 2014 season. He says the Tide's evolution of their passing attack ""is exceptional.""

Coombs believes the three-game stretch that included Ohio State winning the 2015 national championship helped solidify Urban Meyer's recruiting and helped the program take off: ""At least for me, that three-game stretch was a game changer here.""

On a potential return from Jaylen Waddle: ""I think you absolutely have to prepare as if he's gonna return. ... He's a special player. My hat's off to him. If he can recover and play, those type of stories I think are great for college football.""

Coombs: ""You can't play a game scared. That's probably the worst thing you can do.""

On teaching cornerback techniques on deep balls: ""It's an art to play the deep ball. ... It's really one of those skillsets that get better by doing it. The best way to do that is getting more reps in practice."" But Coombs says it's a difficult balance to have players gets reps against deep balls while not overworking them in practice.

On DeVonta Smith: ""He's really, really gifted as a route runner. He's unbelievable physically. ... He catches short balls and makes big plays. He obviously catches deep balls as well as anybody we've gone against. ... I appreciate good players. He's a good player. I enjoy watching him play.""

Shaun Wade

Wade alluded to Ohio State's recent five-star cornerback commit Jaheim Singletary, each of whom came from Jacksonville as a highly rated defensive back recruit. He says ""it's crazy"" how similar their situations are.

Wade is familiar with Mac Jones after having played 7-on-7 with him in Jacksonville during high school. Says they called Jones ""Money Maker Mac.""

He believes John Metchie compares to Jaylen Waddle, calling Metchie ""a great player with a great future.""

When asked which Alabama receiver he most wants to face off against, Wade said ""you already know who I wanna go up against."" He confirmed that the receiver he wants to play against is DeVonta Smith.

Wade says Chris Olave is ""one of the greatest receivers in college football"" and that Olave and Smith have some similarities in height and skill. He says going up against Olave has helped prepare him to face the Heisman Trophy winner.

Wade says that Josh Proctor is ""going to play a big role for us Monday night."" He says Proctor is a ball-hawking safety and he's ""looking forward to seeing him make some plays. ... He just needs to be Josh.""

Wade says all he cares about is ""winning this national championship.""

Jonathon Cooper

Cooper on the struggles of a season filled with adversity: ""Obviously we haven't been silent about how hard it's been in. ... But the message as a team is we have one more. There's nothing left after this. This is why you come to Ohio State.""

Cooper says he returned for a fifth season after last year's injury ""for my teammates"" to ""show the world what I can do,"" and ""to win a national championship.""

Alabama's offensive line, which won the Joe Moore award for the nation's best offensive line, will be the Buckeyes' biggest challenge of this season: ""We have to come out and attack them"" like they do with any other team. He says the challenge of facing them ""is no different than going against our guys in practice.""

Cooper says ""it's special"" having grown up in Ohio watching guys like Troy Smith excel and get the chance to play for a national title: ""I'll get the chance to reflect on all that later on, but right now my focus is on beating Alabama. ... That's where all my focus and energy is towards.""

He believes Ohio State has a deep defensive line: ""It's not just one guy. Across the board, we have great players that we can rely on.""

Having that depth is key to beating an offensive line like Alabama's, he says.

Trevor Lawrence got the ball out fast, and Cooper says the defensive line has to play Mac Jones the same way and ""do anything you can to make sure the quarterback isn't comfortable back there.""

Haskell Garrett

Like Cooper and Pete Werner discussed, Garrett believes the Buckeyes' ""iron sharpens iron"" approach in practice will help the defensive line going against Alabama's offensive line. Playing against guys like Wyatt Davis and Josh Myers, Garrett says, are major helps.

Garrett says that Taron Vincent ""has done an outstanding job"" at defensive tackle, and he's been impressed that Vincent has battled back from injuries to produce in the postseason.

Garrett recalls seeing Najee Harris at The Opening in high school. He praised Harris' speed, versatility and physicality. The Buckeyes have ""a great challenge ahead of us"" with the talent between the two teams now ""equated.""

Alabama's offensive line is ""the best of the best."" Garrett relishes the chance to get to play against them because ""you want to play the best. ... There's nothing that gets you more motivated than playing against a great offensive line.""

Garrett believes the game ""will be won in the trenches. No doubt. ... If you can't move offensive and defensive lines, you don't have a chance, in my opinion."" He says offensive and defensive linemen are ""unsung heroes.""

Each year, Larry Johnson brings something different to the table and gives ""a different flavor"" based on the personnel among the defensive linemen.

Johnson: ""He's not about the rah-rah. He touches your soul. ... I trust him with anything. Once you believe in him and everything he's telling you and teaching you, it'll make your game excel. That's a testament to him. Once you trust him, the sky's the limit.""

Justin Hilliard

Hilliard: ""It's not a secret that Najee Harris is one of the best running backs in college football. ... As long as we have 11 guys running to the football, we'll be all right.""

After having gone through so many injuries and so much adversity, Hilliard says it ""makes it that much sweeter.""

This is Hilliard's last game as a Buckeye and the last game for many other seniors. He says they are ""pouring their heart into"" preparation for the game.

The team's leadership and ""next man up mentality"" has been even more impressive this season and even more imperative to have that mentality with the uncertainties surrounding COVID-19.

On not considering a return for a seventh year, Hilliard says he doesn't think he has any more to give to Ohio State after six years of work. He confirms it is “completely” his intention to make this his final game with the Buckeyes and pursue an NFL career.

Hilliard believes Day ""brought the atmosphere of love and the atmosphere of brotherhood"" to Ohio State even stronger than Urban Meyer.

Pete Werner

Werner praised Hilliard for everything that he's overcome to get to this point where he's playing the best football of his career. He says Hilliard is a close friend who welcomed him into the program and seeing his success is ""unbelievable.""

Werner says Najee Harris and Travis Etienne ""compare pretty close."" He says Harris is a more physical back, but ""as long as we do the same things we did for Etienne we'll do good stopping him.""

The growth of Ohio State's linebackers has been an important piece to the Buckeyes' defense: ""The coaches put a lot more on the linebackers' table toward the end of the season because they know we're capable.""

Alabama has ""a great plan to get (Harris) the ball."" It might look cloudy at times, but then you see him get seven or eight yards when he should have gotten zero. Calls Harris ""a great threat.""

Emil Ekiyor Jr., Alabama's starting right guard, is a former teammate of Werner's at Cathedral (Indiana) High School. He says the two have spoken already about their upcoming matchup and ""we're ready to get after each other.""

""It's not anything different"" going against Alabama's offensive line. Werner says Ohio State's defense likes to compare the Buckeyes' own offensive line to the Crimson Tide's and that going up against their teammates in practice will help prepare them for the challenge.

Washington Football Team DE Chase Young -- I'm not sorry for 'I want Tom' Brady comments,"Jeff Saturday breaks down how Washington's defensive line can get pressure on Tom Brady and the Buccaneers on Saturday. (1:26)

ASHBURN, Va. -- Washington Football Team defensive end Chase Young made it clear Sunday night what he wanted this week: Tom Brady. And that hasn't changed three days later -- even if some tried to turn it into bulletin board material.

After Sunday's NFC East title clinching win at Philadelphia, Young was caught on camera saying, ""Tom Brady, Tom Brady, I'm coming! I want Tom! I want Tom.""

""I play ball,"" Young said Wednesday. ""I'm excited to go against the best. The media, their job is to stir it up. If you know me, I'm excited for every game. Tom Brady, you think I'm not excited to play against the GOAT? You trippin. I'm not going to apologize for saying I want Tom. No, I want every quarterback I play against.""

Young will get his chance against Brady when Washington (7-9) hosts the Tampa Bay Buccaneers (11-5) on Saturday night. Young, the No. 2 overall pick in the draft, has recorded 7.5 sacks and a team-high four forced fumbles. He has returned one fumble for a touchdown. Young ranks seventh with a 22.5 percent pass-rush win rate off the edge, according to ESPN Stats & Information. And, in the last seven games, he's second at 26.9 percent.

But Brady has been sacked only 21 times, fourth fewest in the league for quarterbacks who have started at least 15 games.

""Ask any edge rusher in the league who they want to sack and most might say Tom Brady,"" Young said.

Earlier this week, Young's coach, Ron Rivera, said it will become ""bulletin board material"" for Tampa.

""They'll have fun with it. You've got to chalk it up to youthful exuberance, but that's who Chase is,"" Rivera said. ""I do cringe, but at the same time I smile at it because he loves playing the game. I think that's what it's all about. That's who Chase is. That's the kind of guy we want on our football team.""

The 43-year-old Brady, who will appear in his NFL-record 12th postseason game Sunday, did not take the bait, although his subdued facial expression on a videoconference call said it all.

""He's obviously a great young player,"" Brady said. ""We've got our hands full with that D-line, one of the best D-lines in the league so, Chase is a great young player. Went to Ohio State so naturally I think the Ohio State-Michigan thing wears off on 'em a little bit. I understand that. We're prepared for a tough challenge and it should be a fun game.""

Buccaneers coach Bruce Arians had high praise for Young, but also delivered a word of caution for the rookie about poking the bear.

""He's a hell of a player,"" Arians said. ""Obviously, making him a captain as a rookie speaks volumes. Both those kids from Ohio State -- him and [Terry] McLaurin -- are great kids. He's a handful, but so is [Montez] Sweat, [Daron] Payne, the rest of those guys. Ryan Kerrigan -- I've had a ton of respect for [him] for a long time. We'll have our hands full, but it's one of those games where you better watch what you wish for.""

Young's exuberance has been evident all season. He delivers fiery pregame speeches and walks the sideline during games shouting encouragement to the offense. During a loss to Carolina, when backup quarterback Taylor Heinicke replaced Dwayne Haskins, Young ran onto the field during a timeout to pump up Heinicke.

Facing Brady provides Young one more chance to show his enthusiasm.

""I'm definitely excited to play the GOAT,"" Young said. ""They say the greatest of all time. It's go time.""

"Steelers Wednesday Injury Report Super Wild Card Week: Alualu, Williams Sidelined To Start Week","The Pittsburgh Steelers have now released their first official injury report of Super Wild Card Week ahead of their Sunday home game against the Cleveland Browns and the Wednesday offering shows that two players failed to practice earlier in the day with two others being limited in their participation.

Sitting out the team’s Wednesday practice were defensive tackle Tyson Alualu (ankle) and inside linebacker Vince Williams (quadricep). Neither player was mentioned by Steelers head coach Mike Tomlin on Tuesday, so we’ll have to wait and see if one or both of Alualu and Williams are able to practice in some capacity on Thursday. Williams did not play much in the second half of the Steelers Week 17 road loss to the Browns.

Limited in Wednesday’s practice for the Steelers were kicker Chris Boswell (groin) and cornerback Steven Nelson (knee). Nelson played in the Steelers Week 17 game against the Browns while Boswell missed that contest because of his groin injury. If Boswell can’t play again this Sunday against the Browns the Steelers will likely elevate kicker Matthew Wright from the practice squad again.

The other player on the Steelers Wednesday injury report, safety Terrell Edmunds (shoulder), practiced fully earlier in the day. Edmunds, like Boswell, missed the Week 17 game due to his injury. It marked the first NFL game that Edmunds has missed since being drafted by the Steelers.

Quarterback Ben Roethlisberger is not on the injury report on Wednesday and that means he likely practiced fully. During a normal week, Roethlisberger usually sits out on Wednesday. He, however, along with outside linebacker T.J. Watt, defensive tackle Cameron Heyward, and center Maurkice Pouncey, were held out of the team’s Week 17 game against the Browns so they could all rest up for the playoffs.

As previously reported, Steelers inside linebacker Robert Spillane and guard Matt Feiler both resumed practicing on Wednesday. Both, however, remain on the Steelers Reserve/Injured list as of Wednesday evening. Both have a shot at being activated by Sunday.

Cornerback Joe Haden, tight end Eric Ebron and outside linebacker Cassius Marsh are all still on the Steelers Reserve/COVID-19 list as of Wednesday evening. Haden is expected to miss Sunday’s playoff game against the Browns while the hope is that Ebron and Marsh will be able to come off the COVID list in the next few days and be available to play on Sunday.",['Dave Bryan'],https://news.google.com,high
3 NBA FanDuel Value Plays to Target on 1/6/21,"One of the keys to finding success in daily fantasy basketball is uncovering potential value plays. If you're looking to roster a stud player or two, you need to consider squeezing in one of these lower-salaried options into your lineup.

Let's take a look at five players who can help fill in the gaps in your lineup.

Damyean Dotson, SG, Cleveland Cavaliers ($3,600)

Due to a ton of injuries on the Cleveland Cavaliers, they offer plenty of value tonight.

Here are the players who are out tonight for Cleveland -- Matthew Dellavedova, Dante Exum, Darius Garland, Kevin Love, Kevin Porter Jr., and Dylan Windler. Yikes. This will leave them with a thinner rotation and lead to Damyean Dotson continuing to see plenty of minutes. In the Cavs' last game, Dotson was in the starting lineup, played 29 minutes, and posted 22.2 FanDuel points. While that is under 1.0 FanDuel points per minute, his production compared to his salary is solid.

Tonight, Dotson and the Cavs are up against the Orlando Magic, where the over/under is set at only 213 points. That isn't ideal for an NBA game total, but Dotson is only $100 more than the minimum salary and projected to play 29 minutes. If you are looking to go with a stars and scrubs build tonight, Dotson fits in lineups nicely and will only need 18 FanDuel points to reach 5x value.

Donte DiVincenzo, SG, Milwaukee Bucks ($4,800)

Donte DiVincenzo is in the starting lineup for the Milwaukee Bucks and a solid value play tonight.

DiVincenzo has started in all seven games for Milwaukee and has provided consistent production, despite not having a massive role in the offense. When on the court with the starters, DiVincenzo has a modest 15.6% usage rate but is producing 0.92 FanDuel points per minute. At that production per minute, DiVincenzo has managed to produce 26 FanDuel points or more in four of his seven games this season. That is very strong considering he is in an offense with Giannis Antetokounmpo, Khris Middleton, and Jrue Holiday.

The Bucks are taking on the Detroit Pistons tonight, which should allow DiVincenzo to hit and exceed his recent production. The Pistons come into this game allowing 46.13 FanDuel points per game to opposing shooting guards, which is the second-worst in the league. This is one of the softest matchups on the slate and it will help DiVincenzo excel as one of the best values.

Wendell Carter, C, Chicago Bulls ($4,900)

If you need value at center tonight, look towards Wendell Carter Jr. from the Chicago Bulls.

The Bulls are on the second night of a back-to-back and on the road to take on the Sacramento Kings, where the over/under is set at a whopping 230.5 points. This should make it one of the popular games to target tonight, combined with the fact both teams are in the top 10 for the fastest offensive pace in the league. On top of that, the Kings are allowing 58.79 FanDuel points per game to opposing centers, which is the fourth-worst in the league.

Carter is carrying a solid 22.4% usage rate among the Bulls' starters while producing 0.86 FanDuel points per minute. This has helped Carter post 24 FanDuel points or more in six of his eight games this season, which is a level he should be able to reach easily tonight. As a position, center is loaded, and spending down to Carter will help make your lineups a bit different.","['Jerome Yurchisin', 'Elisha Twerski', 'Jim Sannes', 'Ryan Mccrystal', 'Vaughn Dalzell', 'Brandon Gdula', 'Ryan Kirksey', 'Jay Ginsbach', 'Matt Hiatt', 'Jan']",https://news.google.com,high
"How to fix the Cowboys in 2021: Dak Prescott extension, revamping defense key factors in offseason reboot","There was a lot of hype surrounding the Dallas Cowboys ahead of the 2020 season, and it was justified. After all, they finally parted ways with longtime head coach Jason Garrett after another disappointing year, and made a huge splash in adding Mike McCarthy, who wasted no time cleaning house on the coaching staff. Few were spared -- Leon Lett, Doug Nussmeier and Kellen Moore being the notable three -- and when the Cowboys were ""blessed"" enough to land CeeDee Lamb in the 2020 NFL Draft, the hype hit fever pitch. The wheels began falling off immediately thereafter, however, with the COVID-19 pandemic ultimately cancelling the entire offseason and preseason with the exception of a truncated and socially-distant training camp.

Things only continued downhill from there, with a slew of injuries to All-Pro and Pro Bowl players decimating any hopes the Cowboys had of running roughshod over the NFL. By the time they lost Dak Prescott to a season-ending injury in Week 5, it was already discovered McCarthy had made a grave error in how he constructed his defensive staff, for while his offense was No. 1 in the league, his defense was a laughingstock. Some late-season heroics in December made them viable in Week 17, but they quickly got reminded they're not worthy of making the playoffs this time around.

With work now underway on the 2021 reboot, here's how the Cowboys can answer their biggest questions and fix what was broken in 2020, for the coming season and far into the future:

1. Sign Dak Prescott to a long-term deal

Take three. ACTION.

For a third consecutive offseason, the Cowboys and Prescott will sit at a table and try to hash out the details on a long-term deal that will inevitably make him the highest paid quarterback in the NFL -- a point that stands when assessing how the new money breaks down on the historic deal the Kansas City Chiefs gave Patrick Mahomes. And with DeShaun Watson being awarded his four-year extension with the Houston Texans in 2020, all of the financial framework is now laid bare in Dallas, with Prescott's value both on the field, in the locker room and off the field (e.g., marketing prowess leads to merchandise sales, etc.). The only question remaining is how the salary cap will look this offseason and how that will impact if and when Prescott lands his long-term deal. Jerry Jones readily admits Prescott couldn't possibly have more leverage than he does right now, and while he'll be in a Cowboys uniform next season no matter what, whiffing a third time on the franchise QB -- and after assuring Kellen Moore a deal would land on Prescott -- would be a terrible look for the Joneses, and one that will officially see Prescott facing unrestricted free agency in 2022.

And if things go as planned during the season, the Cowboys won't sniff a top pick next year so, yes, Prescott has nearly all the leverage -- on all possible fronts. Stop quibbling over a fifth year, give him the four he's asking for and enjoy having an elite quarterback on a lethal offense for the foreseeable future, instead of shattering your locker room because you're too lazy to move salary cap and draft pieces around like you know you can.

2. Fire Mike Nolan ... and others?

Nolan never came off the hot seat once he sat on it.

Sure, the Cowboys defense led the league in takeaways in December after being one of the worst in the league in that category for much of the year, but the fact remained the unit was still allowing the most yards in the NFL and it took a slew of takeaways for them to have a chance at winning games. This isn't to demean the importance of takeaways, but rather to point out at a certain point, you're going to have to consistently stop teams from rattling off long drives that end in touchdowns. The defense was statistically the worse in the history of professional football under Nolan, and there are handicaps that he and head coach Mike McCarthy will attempt to use in convincing Jerry Jones to keep the former on board in some capacity, even if it's not as defensive coordinator.

A more proven and prepared mind sits on staff in George Edwards, who could be viewed as both the efficient and potent reset button Jones is staring at, but it might also come with changes that involve additional defensive position coaches. And after seeing his defense give up three touchdowns in the first half of a must-win regular season finale, which included a lack of both preparedness and discipline by the Cowboys, it stands to reason a time-cognizant Jones is upset and completely non-committal to the future of Nolan right now. The defensive scheme and its installation was a full-on disaster, and doesn't warrant a mulligan, even when considering the COVID-19 pandemic.

3. Fix the secondary

There are two reasons to be ecstatic about the Cowboys secondary.

One is rookie second-round pick Trevon Diggs, who graded out phenomenally for an impressive first year that saw him wildly outplay the six cornerbacks drafted ahead of him. The other is safety Donovan Wilson, a second-year talent who couldn't carve his way onto the field until veteran Darian Thompson had one too many bad plays for McCarthy to stomach (and still, it took too long to make this call, in my opinion). With Diggs and Wilson unleashed, the Cowboys have their CB1 and starting safety who can flex as either strong or free, but there's nothing else outside of them to write home to mother about. Chidobe Awuzie, Jourdan Lewis and Xavier Woods are all officially free agents and, at best, the team might bring back one or two on a one-year deal for draft insurance -- assuming the player(s) agree to it.

Speaking of the draft, having the 10th-overall pick in April, it's a perfect chance for the Cowboys to find a complement to Diggs and potentially double dipping in the secondary to grab one for Wilson in the next round. The draft needs to be heavy on rebuilding the defense, to the point no one would or should think twice if the Cowboys used every one of their 10 (projected) picks on that side of the ball. They probably won't, but if they did, I wouldn't blame them in the least after what we all witnessed this past season and considering how seemingly set they are on offense (refer to the importance of point No. 1 again).

4. Get honest at linebacker

""Watch the film."" -- Jaylon Smith

We did, and it required a shower afterward. What it also requires is the Cowboys to swallow their pride, look into the nearest reflective surface and ask themselves if they're truly set for the future at linebacker. Smith is hyper-confident he'll be with the Cowboys in 2021, two years after signing a contract extension, but that's not a foregone conclusion. The fact is Smith is coming off the worst season of his once-promising NFL career, his career arc having gone from miraculous football comeback to Pro Bowler to questionable starter to unjustifiably arrogant backup-caliber linebacker in the span of only four seasons (the first having been a redshirt year due to his devastating knee injury).

Smith isn't a total loss though, and there's reason to keep him around, even if it's no longer as a starter. The Cowboys can't ignore the obvious durability issues on Leighton Vander Esch, and even if Sean Lee returns, he'll be 35 in a few months and can't possibly be viewed as a long- or even a mid-term solution at the position.

That leaves the promise of Francis Bernard and Luke Gifford, but neither could convince McCarthy to utilize them defensively and Gifford did himself no favors with a two-game suspension. Joe Thomas provides a nice veteran presence, much like that of Lee's, but he's a free agent this offseason. Maybe ditching Nolan will help fix Smith, especially if Edwards (who has a ton of experience coaching LBs) takes the reins, but the fact it's a question mark -- along with that of LVE, Bernard, Gifford and Lee -- means Dallas has some soul-searching to do in March and April.

5. Beef up the defensive interior

Signing Dontari Poe showed the Cowboys are at least finally valuing the defensive interior.

The experiment with Poe failed miserably, but it allowed McCarthy to figure out why Antwaun Woods was giving the role as starting nose tackle, and takes pressure off the Cowboys to find an NT1 in 2021. Depth is very much an issue there and at 3-tech (right of center) though, but there's good news in that regard as well, considering the promise of both Trysten Hill and Neville Gallimore.

Other than those notables, however, there's a lot to be figured out. They like the play of Justin Hamilton, but he also faltered at times, and there is no one other than those mentioned who are worth listing as key rotational pieces going forward, based on film and reps from the 2020 season. They'd love to see undrafted free agent Ron'Dell Carter take the next step and there's a great chance he will, but the NFL is a business of contingency and they have another issue to account for in the fact Tyrone Crawford might've played his last snap for the Cowboys (and maybe in the NFL).

The interior of the defensive line is worth addressing in both the draft and free agency, which will likely include a return of Gerald McCoy, but his age and durability will be a question going forward. Get some talented youth to bolster the interior, because ... blockbuster ... trades like the one that brought Eli Ankou to Dallas can't be the formula -- ever.

Honorable mention: Be patient

To be clear, this isn't implying the Cowboys should just sit tight -- otherwise this point would be the totality of this column. It's instead to point out the cavalry is on the way, at least offensively. Prescott is on schedule to report to offseason conditioning on time and with no concerns on his ability to return to prime form, and he'll be joined by starting tackles La'El Collins and Tyron Smith along with Zack Martin, who missed the back end of the season with a calf injury that pushed him to injured reserve. Additionally, having enjoyed seeing the progression of tight end Dalton Schultz as a starting caliber player, the team can now look forward to a tandem that features him and incumbent starter Blake Jarwin -- Jarwin himself returning from a season-ending injury.

With the offensive line again intact and Prescott under center with his full plate of weapons, the offense can get back to cooking on a weekly basis. If not for the historically-bad defense in 2020, the Cowboys would've started much better than 2-3 in their first five games, which is all the evidence they need to push the accelerator to the floor to build a defense that can match serve. From there, some special teams tweaks that include waving goodbye to punter Chris Jones for a well-performing Hunter Niswander adds sprinkles to the ice cream.

Start Of Minor League Seasons To Be Delayed,"While we recently learned that spring training and the MLB 2021 season are set to begin on time, the same cannot be said for the minors. MLB informed teams at the Double-A and Single-A levels that their seasons will be delayed, writes Baseball America’s J.J. Cooper. MLB wants to mitigate the number of overall bodies sharing space at spring training facilities. With that in mind, players at the Double-A and Single-A levels will wait until Major League players as well as those slated for Triple-A have departed their facilities. Presumably, that means Triple-A will aim for a more traditional start to their season.

Cooper provides additional information from the memo, writing, “Additionally, the memo told minor league teams to expect their schedules to run until as late as Oct. 3, a full month after regular season games normally end in early September. It is also expected there will be no minor league playoffs in 2021. With a delayed start, those playoff dates will be exchanged for more dates for all teams.”

After a year with no minor league baseball at all, this news comes not as a surprise, nor an inconvenience, but closer to, as Cooper describes it, a “relief.” Minor league teams do not have nearly the resources to stay socially distanced as players at the Major League level. Travel between cities will be a particular concern for teams as MLB puts together the minor league schedule. From MLB’s perspective, the slow roll-out is an opportunity to establish their new development system incrementally, which could ultimately provide a runway to make further changes to former norms.

With a new 120-team MLB-run minor league system kicking-off, this year will prioritize providing a space for competitive, developmental play for those players trying to make their way to the big leagues. Playoffs will, at some point, return to the minor league system, but for now, the focus is safely providing venues for minor league players to get back on the ball field without overtaxing the now-cohesive overall structure that encompasses both Major and minor league baseball leagues. The delays also gives more time for vaccines to be distributed, which in a best case scenario, could allow for fan attendance at minor league facilities sometime down the line.",['Tc Zencka'],https://news.google.com,high
"Tuukka Rask Addresses Departure From NHL Bubble, Return To Bruins","Tuukka Rask is leaving little room for doubt about his departure from the Toronto bubble.

Rask left the bubble before Game 3 of the Boston Bruins’ first-round Stanley Cup playoffs series for what later was revealed to be a family emergency. He never returned to Toronto as the Bruins were eliminated by the eventual champion Tampa Bay Lightning in the next round, so his appearance at training camp is the first time he’s been seen in a while.

Rask indicated Wednesday how dire it was for him to return to Boston.

“It was a tough decision to leave, but then again it wasn’t because I knew it was more important for me to be home at that time, so that was easy to live with,” Rask said during a Zoom conference. “But also, on the other hand, knowing you can’t be there, you should be there playing hockey, so it’s tough to watch the games — you’re kind of caught in this middle, your brain is kind of spinning at that point knowing you’re in the right place at home, but then again you should be there. So it was tough for a few weeks, but it helped (that) I was talking to (Bruins goalie Jaroslav Halak) a lot, I was talking to a lot of guys that gave their support, they knew what was going on. There was that.

“(An emergency) was the reason I left,” Rask later said. “I got a phone call the night before — everything happened so quickly I think that (Bruins general manager Don Sweeney) got caught by surprise, too. I got a phone call the night before that our daughter really wasn’t doing so well at that point, they had to call an ambulance and everything. So obviously at that point, my mind is spinning, I was thinking, ‘I need to get out of here.’ So the next morning, I informed (Sweeney) and we had a brief talk and then I just left.”

Since returning to Boston, Rask and his family have stayed put, electing not to go back to Finland for an extended period of time. He’s been in touch with teammates periodically, and making his return to camp hasn’t been awkward.

“No issues coming in here,” Rask said. “We’ve been in touch throughout the summer and had discussions about whatever in life with teammates, and there’s no issues coming back.”

Bruins head coach Bruce Cassidy indicated Tuesday that Rask seemed like he was in a good place, estimating the netminder is likely to get somewhere in the neighborhood of 33-34 games this season.

LPGA Commissioner Mike Whan to Step Down This Year,"LPGA commissioner Mike Whan made a stunning announcement Wednesday that he will step down sometime this year.

Whan, who recently completed his 11th year at the helm of the LPGA, recently notified the tour’s board of directors of his decision. There is no set date for his departure.

In a letter to LPGA staff, members and sponsors, Whan said that he reached his decision after “many, many months of deep introspection.”

“I simply wouldn’t leave the LPGA if I thought the future was uncertain or not trending straight up,” he wrote. “In fact, even after the challenges we faced in 2020, the LPGA has NEVER been more financially secure, deeper in leadership talent, or more anchored by passionate, diverse sponsors from all around the world. The LPGA is poised for even greater heights, and as such, I’m excited to hand the baton to the next leader and become their biggest supporter.”

Whan will exit as the longest-tenured commissioner in tour history. Over the past 11 years he rescued the LPGA from the brink and guided the tour through a series of financial challenges, most recently the coronavirus pandemic. The LPGA recently announced an ambitious schedule for this year, a 34-event slate that features new tournaments, new sponsors and a record $76.45 million in prize money. In 2010, the year Whan took over, the LPGA had only 24 official events – its smallest schedule in nearly 40 years – and just $41.4 million in prize money.

LPGA board chair Diane Gulyas called Whan a ""transformational leader"" of the LPGA.

“Mike has absolutely been the right leader at the right time,” said Vicki Goetze-Ackerman, the LPGA’s player president. “He rebuilt the tour – and then reimagined its future – by bringing new events, new sponsors and a new value proposition around diversity and inclusion to the LPGA. He has that rare ability to get people of all ages and backgrounds excited and on board with his vision. We’re grateful for his leadership over these 11 years and know he’ll remain an advocate for the LPGA long after he departs.”

The LPGA said it will soon establish a selection and transition committee.","['Brentley Romine', 'Rex Hoggard', 'Brandel Chamblee']",https://news.google.com,high

One observation about Chara in his first practice: he sometimes knocks guys over even when he's not attempting to check them. He's just bigger. — Tarik El-Bashir (@Tarik_ElBashir) January 6, 2021

It doesn’t even look like Chara is trying and Hathaway, one of the strongest guys on the team, crumples to the ice.

Alex Ovechkin’s observations from Monday about the 43-year-old defenseman ultimately were correct.

“I think he’s experienced you know? He’s a winner. I think he’s a really competitive guy. He wants to play. He wants to win. He’s still big strong,” Ovechkin said. “He’s going to help our D to learn a lot.”",[],https://news.google.com,high

Additional COVID-19 restrictions in effect as Hamilton County goes red on state metrics • Current Publishing,"Additional COVID-19 restrictions are in effect for Hamilton County after the Indiana Dept. of Health on Jan. 6 categorized it as red under its advisory level for determining community spread of the disease.

The state is requiring that counties categorized as red:

Limit social gatherings to 25 people, with no exceptions from the local health department

Limit attendance at recreational sporting events to participants, required personnel, parents, guardians, siblings, spouses and minor children of participants or personnel

Allow for indoor dining but encourage businesses to promote curbside pick-up or online ordering

Suggest K-12 school officials review and reevaluate their plans based on the recommendations of the Dept. of Education and IDOH

Suspend activities at senior centers

Allow hospitals, long term care and other congregate settings to impose visitation limits.

Counties designated as red have 200 or more weekly cases per 100,000 residents and a seven-day all-test positivity rate of 15 percent or greater.

“Unfortunately, the new designation doesn’t come as a huge surprise,” stated Jason LeMaster, interim administrator for the Hamilton County Health Dept. in a press release. “Our local positivity rate has been fluctuating near the 15 percent threshold for days and we’re only just now seeing the swell of cases from over the holiday season.”

The county must meet orange level metrics for two consecutive weeks before it can return to that designation. Counties classified as orange have a weekly COVID-19 caseload of 100 to 199 per 100,000 residents and a seven-day all-test positivity rate of 10 to 14.9 percent.

“That means Hamilton County will remain in RED for at least the next three weeks.” LeMaster stated. “The only way we can reverse course is to lower our numbers, so we’re asking the community to be incredibly vigilant. Wash your hands. Social distance. Avoid indoor gatherings and get tested if you think you may have been exposed to the virus. We all have the power to right this ship.”

"Wisconsin crosses 5,000 COVID-19 deaths","MADISON Wis. (WBAY) – Wisconsin crossed the threshold of 5,000 COVID-19 deaths Wednesday with the release of the state Department of Health Services report. The death toll is now 5,039 with the deaths of 60 more people.

COVID-19 is equivalent to the third leading cause of death in Wisconsin, based on the latest ranked data available from the CDC -- killing more people in 11 months than suicide, flu, pneumonia, diabetes and liver disease combined killed in all of 2018.

The 60 deaths were in Barron, Brown, Clark (2), Columbia, Fond du Lac, Jefferson (2), Kenosha (3), La Crosse (2), Marathon, Marinette (2), Milwaukee (3), Oconto, Outagamie (3), Ozaukee (3), Pepin, Racine (10), Rock, Rusk, Sauk, Sheboygan (2), Walworth (4), Washburn (2), Waukesha (8), Waupaca, Winnebago (2) and Wood counties.

The DHS reports it received 9,974 results from people being tested or testing positive for coronavirus for the first time, identifying 3,406 new cases. The remaining 6,568 tested negative. New cases were found in 70 of Wisconsin’s 72 counties; Forest and Price were the exceptions.

The new cases is well above the 7-day average of 2,494 cases per day. The state is averaging 32 deaths per day over the past week; four of those days reported 10 deaths or fewer. The death rate edged up again to 1.02%, after reaching a low of 0.89% on December 3.

As always, case and death numbers by county are listed later in this article.

Wisconsin is also nearing 500,000 coronavirus cases diagnosed since the first patient on February 5, 2020. Currently there are 494,747 confirmed cases.

The state says 27,843 (5.6%) of these cases are still active -- diagnosed in the past 30 days and haven’t been medically cleared. Another 461,729 people diagnosed (93.4%) have recovered, though the DHS acknowledges some who fit the broad definition may be suffering lingering effects from the disease.

Hospitalizations

The DHS says 175 more COVID-19 patients were hospitalized in the past 24 hours. The 7-day average for hospitalizations has risen to 109 per day, just days after reaching a three-month low.

A total 21,971 people have ever been hospitalized for COVID-19 treatment, which is 4.4% of all coronavirus cases -- a percentage that hasn’t changed in months.

The Wisconsin Hospital Association (WHA) reported there were 1,128 COVID-19 patients hospitalized, including 243 in intensive care, on Wednesday [updated figures].

Hospitalized 24-hr change ICU 24-hr change Statewide 1,128 +26 243 -2 Fox Valley region

(8 counties, 13 hospitals) 61 -3 6 -1 Northeast region

(7 counties, 10 hospitals) 105 +3 22 -3

Daily changes in hospital figures take new admissions, discharges and deaths into account.

At last word, there were no patients at the alternate care facility at State Fair Park. The field hospital was established in October to take patients from hospitals who are close to discharge but still need some care, such as oxygen treatments, freeing up beds for patients with more serious needs. The facility also provides Bamlanivimab infusion therapy on an outpatient basis.

COVID Recovery Clinic

Tuesday, Prevea Health announced a COVID Recovery Clinic for people suffering symptoms 14 days or longer after their diagnosis, such as body aches or joint pain, coughing, shortness of breath, fatigue, difficulty sleeping, headaches, “brain fog,” dizziness or gastrointestinal issues. Contact your Prevea primary care provider or, if you don’t have a Prevea provider, call (920) 272-3540 in the Green Bay area or Lakeshore or (920) 846-8187 in the Oconto Falls area.

Hospital Readiness

The Wisconsin Hospital Association (WHA) reported 250 ICU beds (17.1%) and 1,801 of all types of medical beds (16.1%) -- ICU, intermediate care, medical surgical and negative flow isolation -- were open in the state’s 134 hospitals.

The Fox Valley region’s 13 hospitals had 13 ICU beds (12.5%) and 83 of all medical beds (9.7%) open among them in the eight counties they serve.

In the Northeast region, there were 57 ICU beds (27.5%) and 217 of all medical beds (22.7%) open among the 10 hospitals serving seven counties.

These beds are for all patients, not just COVID-19, and whether a bed can be filled depends on whether the hospital has the necessary medical and support staff.

Vaccinations

The DHS launched a website updating how many vaccines have been allocated and administered. The site is updated every Tuesday. The state was averaging 4,280 vaccinations a day since December 15. As of Tuesday, 64,674 Pfizer vaccines and 20,935 Moderna vaccines for COVID-19 were administered.

Right now, the vaccine supply is devoted to health care workers, residents and staff at nursing homes and senior living facilities, EMS crews and other essential frontline workers. The CDC is also recommending people 75 and older get vaccinated: Contact your local health provider. Following those, the CDC recommends vaccinating people 65 and older, people 16 and older who have underlying medical conditions, and more essential workers.

Gov. Tony Evers acknowledges it may be months before the general public is able to get vaccinated. He says rather than focusing on vaccination numbers, it’s more important to continue practicing safe habits like wearing face masks, social distancing, and frequent hand washing (see related story).

We’ve heard from local health departments saying they’re inundated by people asking when they can get a COVID-19 vaccine. Health departments will make it very well known through the news media and social media when they’re ready to vaccinate certain age groups and then the general public.

Testing

The state says 2,861,826 people have been tested for COVID-19. That’s equivalent to 49.2% of the state’s population.

In addition to the official daily numbers, the DHS reports results for people tested multiple times, such as health care workers or patients being treated for COVID-19. By these measures, the DHS received 25,830 results Monday, including 3,062 that were positive, and the 7-day positivity rate is rising, now at 11.6%. These results are very preliminary and at least a day behind the official state reporting; they include negative tests undergoing further review and take about two weeks to finalize. We emphasize that reporting one result per person rather than multiple tests is considered a better indicator of the virus’s spread in the community and is how the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention compiles its own reports.

Health Secretary-designee Andrea Palm says the state’s COVID-19 contact tracing app has been downloaded one million times since it debuted for iOS and Android mobile devices two weeks ago. When two devices that have the app installed are close enough for long enough, they share a string of random numbers. When a person tests positive for the coronavirus, they can enter a code to anonymously notify people whose mobile devices have a match (see related story).

* Cases and deaths are from the daily DHS COVID-19 reports, which may differ from local health department numbers. The DHS reports cases from all health departments within a county’s boundaries, including tribal, municipal and county health departments; county websites may not. Also, public health departments update their data at various times, whereas the DHS freezes the numbers it receives by the same time every day to compile the afternoon report.

The DHS reports deaths attributed to COVID-19 or in which COVID-19 contributed to their death. Most of the people severely affected by the coronavirus have underlying illnesses or conditions, such as diabetes, heart disease or obesity, which raises a person’s risk of dying from COVID-19. They would’ve lived longer if not for their infection. The state may revise case and death numbers after further review, such as the victim’s residence, duplicated records, or a correction in lab results. Details can be found on the DHS website and Frequently Asked Questions.

**The state of Michigan does not update numbers on Sundays. Monday’s numbers include updates since Saturday’s reporting deadline.

COVID-19 Tracing App

Wisconsin’s COVID-19 tracing app, “Wisconsin Exposure Notification,” is available for iOS and Android smartphones. No download is required for iPhones. The Android app is available on Google Play. When two phones with the app (and presumably their owners) are close enough, for long enough, they’ll anonymously share a random string of numbers via Bluetooth. If someone tests positive for the coronavirus, they’ll receive a code to type into the app. If your phones “pinged” each other in the last 14 days, you’ll receive a push notification that you are at risk of exposure. The app doesn’t collect personal information or location information, so you won’t know from whom or where, but you will be told what day the exposure might have occurred so that you can quarantine for the appropriate amount of time.

COVID-19 Home Testing

Gov. Tony Evers announced at-home COVID-19 testing kits will be made available -- for free -- to anyone who wants them. A person can test themselves or family members, even if they don’t have symptoms, then send it to a lab for testing. The Vault Medical Services kit is the first saliva test to get emergency-use authorization from the FDA and normally costs $119. CLICK HERE for details and a link to request a test kit.

COVID-19 Vaccine

As of Tuesday, December 29, the state says 47,157 COVID-19 vaccines out of the 156,875 vaccines shipped have been administered. The state started giving out the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine on Dec. 14th, with 40,850 of them being administered so far. Moderna vaccinations started Dec. 22nd, and 6,306 of them have been administered. In addition, 29,000 doses will be allocated to vaccinating residents and staff members at long-term care facilities. The state is updating vaccine information at dhs.wisconsin.gov/covid-19/vaccine.htm.

Symptoms

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention identified these as possible symptoms of COVID-19:

Fever of 100.4 or higher

Cough

Shortness of breath

Chills

Repeated shaking with chills

Muscle pain

Headache

Sore throat

New loss of taste or smell

Prevention

The coronavirus is a new, or “novel,” virus. Nobody has a natural immunity to it. Children and teens seem to recover best from the virus. Older people and those with underlying health conditions (heart disease, diabetes, lung disease) are considered at high risk, according to the CDC. Precautions are also needed around people with developing or weakened immune systems.

To help prevent the spread of the virus:

Stay at least six feet away from other people

Avoid close contact with people who are or appear sick

Stay at home as much as possible

Cancel events and avoid groups, gatherings, play dates and nonessential appointments

‘Incredible’ gene-editing result in mice inspires plans to treat premature-aging syndrome in children,"‘Incredible’ gene-editing result in mice inspires plans to treat premature-aging syndrome in children

One mouse is hunched over, graying, and barely moves at 7 months old. Others, at 11 months, have sleek black coats and run around. The videos and other results from a new study have inspired hope for treating children born with progeria, a rare, fatal, genetic disease that causes symptoms much like early aging. In mice with a progeria-causing mutation, a cousin of the celebrated genome editor known as CRISPR corrected the DNA mistake, preventing the heart damage typical of the disease, a research team reports today in Nature . Treated mice lived about 500 days, more than twice as long as untreated animals.

“The outcome is incredible,” says gene-therapy researcher Guangping Gao of the University of Massachusetts, who was not involved with the study.

Although the developers of the progeria therapy aim to improve it, they are also taking steps toward testing the current version in affected children, and some other scientists endorse a rush. The mouse results are “beyond anyone’s wildest expectations,” says Fyodor Urnov, a gene-editing researcher at the University of California, Berkeley. “The new data are an imperative to treat a child with progeria … and do so in the next 3 years.”

About 400 people in the world are estimated to have Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome, which results from a single-base change in the gene for a protein called lamin A that helps support the membrane forming the nucleus in cells. The resulting abnormal protein, called progerin, disrupts the nuclear membrane and is toxic to cells in many tissues. Toddlers soon become bald and have stunted growth, body fat loss, stiff joints, wrinkled skin, osteoporosis, and atherosclerosis. People with progeria die on average around age 14 from a heart attack or stroke.

Researchers have previously used CRISPR to disrupt activity of the mutated gene for lamin A in progeria mice. But their health improved only modestly, and disabling a person’s good copy of the gene could cause harm. So David Liu of Harvard University and the Broad Institute turned to base editing, a DNA-changing method originally inspired by CRISPR and developed in his lab. Unlike CRISPR, which makes double-strand cuts in DNA, the base editor used in the progeria study nicks just one strand and swaps out a single base. Base editors have treated liver, eye, ear, blood, and brain disorders in mice, and Liu wanted to try one on an “infamous and devastating” disease that involves multiple organs or tissues.

Liu’s group teamed up with Vanderbilt University cardiologist Jonathan Brown and Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, whose group was one of two that identified the progeria mutation in 2003. The team first tested the base-editing approach in cultured cells from two progeria patients, finding that it corrected the mutation while making few unwanted changes elsewhere in the genome. They then packaged DNA encoding the base editor into adeno-associated viruses (AAVs), a standard delivery vehicle for gene therapies, and injected these into young mice with the progeria mutation.

“The results were far better than we had dared to hope,” Collins says. When the mice were examined 6 months later, between 20% and 60% of their bone, skeletal muscle, liver, heart, and aorta carried the DNA fix. Progerin levels fell and lamin A levels rose in several tissues. Even though the mice were already 2 weeks old when treated, or about age 5 in human years, their aortas months later bore virtually no signs of the fibrous tissue growth or loss of smooth muscle cells seen in mice and children with progeria. “It hits home the potential of this technology,” says gene-editing researcher Charles Gersbach of Duke University.

Some of the rodents eventually developed liver tumors, a problem seen before in mice receiving high-dose AAV gene therapy. No people have been shown to have developed liver tumors as a result of such treatments. Still, lowering the AAV dose to improve safety “is a goal,” Liu says. He and Collins are evaluating more efficient base editors to that end.

Study co-author Leslie Gordon, a Brown University physician whose son died from progeria and who co-founded the Progeria Research Foundation, doesn’t want to wait for “the next iteration” before developing plans and raising money to test the treatment in children. Her foundation is talking to companies, including Beam Therapeutics, which Liu co-founded, in hopes of launching a clinical trial. “We will find a way to get this done for these kids,” Gordon says.",['Jocelyn Kaiser'],https://news.google.com,high
"As ICU bed crisis escalates, California orders counties to accept transfer patients","Intensive care availability sank in the Bay Area again on Tuesday and there were virtually no vacant ICU beds across much of the state for the 19th straight day, as California groped for a way out of the long winter surge.

The intensive care situation statewide has become so dire that the state Tuesday night issued a new health order that requires counties with reasonable ICU availability, which would include several in the Bay Area, to accept transfer patients from hospitals that are in crisis and can no longer provide adequate care.

Hospitals in Southern California and the San Joaquin Valley have been inundated with COVID-19 patients for weeks and may be forced to ration care soon. The new health order also requires most counties in those regions to cancel almost all elective surgeries. The order is effective immediately.

“This order helps ensure that patients continue to receive appropriate medical services by better distributing available resources across the state to prevent overwhelming specific hospitals, counties and regions,” said Dr. Tomás Aragón, director of the California Department of Public Health and the state health officer, in a statement. The order was Aragón’s first since he assumed the state post this month; he was previously the San Francisco health officer.

“When hospitals are overwhelmed and overflowing, they are no longer able to provide the traditional standards of care we expect,” he said, “but if health care resources are available elsewhere, we should ensure Californians can receive appropriate care.”

The state has struggled with its current surge for more than two months, and though there are signs it may level off, the next few weeks are still looking grim, public health officials said.

At the same time, vaccines have rolled out much slower than hoped for or expected. Further exacerbating a bad situation, a new, more infectious strain of the coronavirus is circulating — 28 more cases were announced in San Diego County on Tuesday, for a total of 34 statewide — which could complicate attempts to slow the spread of disease.

“December was really hard, and January is not going to be any easier,” said San Francisco Mayor London Breed during a Tuesday news conference.

It’s too soon to say how much more pressure will be placed on hospitals from an anticipated increase in cases due to the end-of-year holidays. Several Bay Area counties are reporting the first hints of a post-Christmas spike. But public health officials say they can’t yet tell if they are facing a small bump or the start of a new “surge on top of a surge.”

On Monday, the state reported 74,135 cases, a one-day record by a significant margin, though it included a backlog of cases from the long holiday weekend for some counties.

Intensive care availability dropped to 5.9% for the Bay Area on Tuesday, but that number ranged dramatically across counties. San Francisco reported that 35% of its ICU beds were available and four patients had been transferred to city hospitals from other counties.

ICU availability has been at 0% in Southern California and the San Joaquin Valley, the two hardest-hit regions, since mid-December.

San Francisco public health officials could not immediately say Tuesday what impact the new health order would have on local hospitals. But in a news briefing earlier in the day, Dr. Grant Colfax, director of the San Francisco Department of Public Health, noted that the enormous ICU stress in other parts of the state could affect the Bay Area, too.

“While we have care available and people need care, it’s the moral and ethical and right thing to do to provide that care when asked,” Colfax said, referring to the transfer patients currently hospitalized in the city. “We are watching our capacity very carefully, because as the central and southern part of the state continue to experience a catastrophic situation, and as the region has fewer ICU beds, we would expect our local ICU bed capacity to start going down as well.”

Cases and deaths

The seven-day average in daily cases has ticked up in some Bay Area counties and remains flat for the region as a whole. A few counties are reporting drops in cases, though it’s hard to say if that’s due to holiday lags in testing and reporting or an actual decrease in disease spread.

“I would hesitate to make any radical policy changes based on holiday data so far, this early on. A lot of things in COVID play out over weeks, and we’re still only 10 days out from Christmas,” said Dr. Nicholas Moss, the Alameda County health officer.

He said an increase in cases after Christmas and New Year’s will surely arrive. “The question is: Will it be the worst-case scenario where we’ll have a resumption in day-over-day increases?” Moss said. “Or is it a blip? Things go up but they go down again, and the dynamics just aren’t there to drive a surge.”

The state reported 503 deaths on Tuesday, higher than the previous week’s daily average. The Bay Area reported 73 deaths, also marked increase from the past several days. Both those talleys were the second highest for the state and region since the pandemic began.

Hospitals and intensive care

Cases have picked up in Contra Costa County since Christmas, but officials said they don’t yet know how big the post-holiday surge will be, and they’re concerned about the extra strain on hospitals. Intensive care availability has been in the single digits in the county in recent days.

“So, we’re already at the highest we’ve ever been, and having those cases down the pike is worrisome,” said Dr. Ori Tzvieli, the deputy health officer. “We’re sort of holding our breath and hoping our peak will not be as big as Southern California’s, because they’re really, really struggling down there.”

As of Monday, 269 COVID-19 patients were hospitalized in Contra Costa County, including 69 in intensive care — both peaks for the pandemic. For the Bay Area, intensive care counts dropped slightly from a weekend high, with 495 people in the ICU as of Monday; 2,134 COVID-19 patients were hospitalized in the region.

Statewide, 21,597 people were hospitalized with COVID-19 and 4,623 were in the ICU — both new peaks for the pandemic.

Ordinarily, counties will provide backup to one another if a hospital is overwhelmed with patients, as can happen during a bad flu season. But Tzvieli said that’s not as viable an option now, with hospitals strained all over California. The state has opened six “alternative care sites” to help handle the overflows.

Tzvieli said hospitals in his county are handling their current patient load, but he worries that one large outbreak — at a nursing home or from a superspreading event, for example — could be disastrous.

“Right now they’re close to the edge,” Tzvieli said.

Virus variant

San Diego County officials said Tuesday that they have identified 28 more cases of people likely infected with the new coronavirus variant that’s been raising alarm around the world. The county has reported a total of 32 confirmed or probable cases, and two other cases were identified in San Bernardino County over the weekend.

The San Diego County cases include 28 that have been confirmed with genomic sequencing, and four cases that were linked directly to one of the confirmed infections. The specimens were collected Dec. 27 to Dec. 31. One of the 32 patients was temporarily hospitalized but the others have remained at home.

None of the patients had traveled recently so they did not pick up the strain in the United Kingdom, where the variant was first identified, or any other place outside California. The patients are from 19 different households in four cities.

“The fact that these cases have been identified in multiple parts of the region shows that this strain of the virus could be rapidly spreading,” said Dr. Wilma Wooten, the San Diego County health officer, in a statement. “People should be extra cautious to prevent getting and spreading COVID-19, especially this variant, which research has shown is more contagious.”

The variant has been identified in at least four other states. Bay Area public health officials said they suspect it is circulating in this region too, though they have not identified any cases yet.

Woman Dies 'Suddenly' 2 Days After Getting Pfizer Vaccine,"Woman Dies 'Suddenly' After Getting Pfizer Vaccine

In a shocking incident that has raised questions over the safety of Covid-19 vaccine, a health worker in Portugal died two days after getting the Pfizer vaccine.

As per Daily Mail, 41-year-old Sonia Acevedo suffered a ‘sudden death’ at home on New Year’s Day 48 hours after receiving the jab.

Notably, Sonia had no prior health conditions, and did not suffer from any adverse side-effects after being vaccinated.

Mother-of-two, Sonia worked in paediatrics at the Portuguese Institute of Oncology in Porto.

The coronavirus vaccine developed by Pfizer was given to Sonia on December 30 as she was a frontline health worker.

Shocked at her death, Acevedo’s father Abilio Acevedo, urged authorities to probe into her demise and said he ‘wanted answers’.

He told Portuguese news outlet Correio da Manha: ”She was okay. She hadn’t had any health problems. She had the Covid-19 vaccine but she didn’t have any symptoms. I don’t know what happened. I just want answers. I want to know what led to my daughter’s death.”

The Portuguese Institute of Oncology said in a statement: ‘With regards to the sudden death of an operational assistant from the Porto IPO on January 1, 2021, the Board of Directors confirms the event and expresses sincere regret to family and friends in the certainty that this loss is also felt here. The explanation of the cause of death will follow the usual procedures in these circumstances.’

An epidemic of overdiagnosis: Melanoma diagnoses sky rocket,"Melanoma of the skin is now the third most commonly diagnosed cancer in the US

WHO H. Gilbert Welch MD, MPH, Senior Investigator, Center for Surgery and Public Health, Brigham and Women's Hospital; co-author of a new Sounding Board article published in The New England Journal of Medicine.

WHAT Melanoma of the skin is now the third most commonly diagnosed cancer in the U.S. Diagnoses of melanoma are six times as high today as they were 40 years ago. While incidence of melanoma has been rising steeply, melanoma mortality has been generally stable. In a Sounding Board article, Welch and colleagues present evidence for why they believe that increased diagnostic scrutiny is the primary driver of the rapid rise in melanoma diagnoses.

""Melanoma is now the posterchild for overdiagnosis,"" said Welch. ""Although the conventional response has been to recommend regular skin checks, it is far more likely that more skin checks are the cause of the epidemic -- not its solution.""

Among many examples, Welch and co-authors describe a study in which nine dermatopathologists reviewed skin-biopsy specimens used for diagnosis 20 years earlier. Many of the specimens previously diagnosed as benign were now diagnosed as melanoma. Welch and co-authors also share data showing that among the Medicare population, the proportion of beneficiaries biopsied increased every year from 2004 to 2017, nearly doubling over that time. Over the same period, the incidence of melanoma in adults 65 and older also doubled.

The authors point out that there are many potential harms in over-diagnosing melanoma, from the immediate -- scarring, wound infection, out-of-pocket costs -- to longer term effects such as impeding access to care for people with symptomatic skin diseases.

""Despite the best of intentions by all parties, increased diagnostic scrutiny can produce a cycle of increasing overdiagnosis and intervention in any disease with a reservoir of subclinical forms. Melanoma is no exception,"" the authors write. ""The economic disruption caused by Covid-19 obliges clinicians to protect people from the financial stress of needlessly being turned into a patient.""

Virus variant found in S. Africa may resist antibodies,"Antibodies against the novel coronavirus may not work as well against a new variant of the virus identified in South Africa, early data suggest.

Scientists recently raised concerns that the variant, known as 501.V2, may be resistant to COVID-19 vaccines , Live Science previously reported . Experts noted that the variant has accumulated a significant number of mutations in its spike protein , a pointed structure that sticks off the virus's surface and binds to human cells to trigger infection.

The authorized vaccines target this spike protein, so if it mutates substantially, the vaccines may not be as protective. Similarly, antibody drugs and the antibodies that people naturally produce when they catch COVID-19 could also be less protective against such a mutant.

Related: 20 of the worst epidemics and pandemics in history

Now, a new study posted Jan. 4 to the preprint database bioRxiv suggests that this may be the case with 501.V2. The study, which has not been peer-reviewed, found that specific mutations in the spike protein make the variant less vulnerable to some people's antibodies — but critically, these mutations don't make the new variant invincible, only less vulnerable to attack. Additionally, while some people's antibodies couldn't bind well to the variant, others' antibodies still bound well to the mutant.

""There is extensive person-to-person variation in how mutations affect serum antibody binding and neutralization,"" meaning how well the antibodies stop the virus from infecting cells, the authors wrote. That said, mutations at one location on the spike protein — called E484 — stood out as a potential issue. For some people, a mutation at E484 meant the antibodies' ability to block the virus from entering cells fell more than 10-fold.

Unfortunately, 501.V2 has a mutation at the E484 site, ""as do some other isolates from elsewhere,"" the authors noted in a tweet . That means that the variant may be less vulnerable to some people's antibodies and to antibody drugs, but more studies are needed to know whether vaccine-generated antibodies will be similarly affected, the authors added.

The team reached these conclusions by zooming in on the ""receptor binding domain"" (RBD) of the spike protein, the part of the spike that directly binds to the cell surface. Antibodies come in different flavors, and those that target the RBD are the most critical for neutralizing the coronavirus, according to a study published Nov. 12 in the journal Cell . Because of this, mutations in the RBD could help new variants evade the immune system , the authors noted.

The team mapped how different mutations in the RBD would affect its structure and thus the ability of antibodies to bind to it; they then genetically modified yeast cells to grow the mutant RBD on their surfaces. In experiments called ""neutralizing assays,"" the team exposed their mutant yeast to blood serum, the liquid portion of blood that contains antibodies; these samples were drawn from individuals who had recovered from COVID-19 and developed antibodies against the virus.

The team also conducted assays with synthetic viruses, called pseudoviruses, which were made to resemble SARS-CoV-2 and were also equipped with mutant RBD, just like the yeast. These pseudoviruses were incubated with human cells and the sampled antibodies, in order to see whether the antibodies stopped the cells from becoming infected.

On average, mutations at the E484 site showed the largest effect on antibody binding and neutralization of the virus. That said, at the individual level, ""a few samples were essentially unaffected by E484 mutations,"" and other mutations stood out as a bigger problem, the team noted in their paper. For example, some of the samples from recovered patients did not bind as well to RBD with mutations in the so-called ""443-450 loop,"" a structure that the Regeneron antibody cocktail, called REGEN-COV2, also targets.

As we learn more about the effects of different mutations on SARS-CoV-2 immunity, it will be important to run similar studies with vaccine-generated antibodies, too, the authors noted. Thankfully, even the E484 mutations only eroded the neutralizing activity of some of the blood samples tested, and they didn't completely wipe out the antibodies' power in any, the authors tweeted . That raises the likelihood that available vaccines will retain their usefulness ""for quite a while,"" they wrote.

While we continue to monitor the 501.V2 variant, the priority now should be to vaccinate as many people as possible, Dr. Scott Gottlieb, former commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, said on Jan. 5, CNBC reported .

""The new variant has mutated a part of the spike protein that our antibodies bind to, to try to clear the virus itself, so this is concerning,"" Gottlieb said. ""Now, the vaccine can become a backstop against these variants really getting more of a foothold here in the United States, but we need to quicken the pace of vaccination,"" he said.

Many Who Charged The Capitol Building Today Have Communist Tattoos And Look Just Like ANTIFA Pretending To Be Trump Supporters • Now The End Begins,"NOW THE END BEGINS SHARE:

If you’re saved, pray and ask God to give YOU boldness in these last days, as the greatest, most-powerful nation that has ever existed is brought to it’s knees by its own leaders.

Now that we have had a little bit of time to digest what’s been happening at the Capitol building in Washington, it would now appear that at least some of the rioters at the Trump rally are ANTIFA militants pretending to be Trump supporters. I say this because so many of them look like flaming, effeminate extras from some dystopian Broadway play, prancing around in Viking costumes, some with the hammer & sickle of the Soviet Union, and others, well, looking the exact opposite of what Trump supporters look like. Trump supporters don’t look like card-carrying members of the LGBTQ+.

“Arise, O God, judge the earth: for thou shalt inherit all nations.” Psalm 82:8 (KJB)

I have no doubt that everything we are seeing right now has all been orchestrated to cause maximum chaos, and that the Democrats are behind all of it. These riots today gives them the excuse to have their favorite fantasy fulfilled, Trump led out of the White House in handcuffs. Don’t think that’s not possible, because it is. Remember we told you back in September of 2020 about something called the Transition Integrity Project? Looks like everything that has happened since the election is right out of this playbook.

Democrats are very good at being malicious and evil, and once we start digging a little deeper we will find George Soros and his billions behind all this. The people in the top photo may be holding a Trump flag, but look closely at their ANTIA-style tattoos, the man in the Viking hat has a pedo-friendly tat on his left pectoral area. They may not all be ANTIFA, but I can guarantee they are not all Trump supporters, either.

President Trump – most of the violent protesters are ANTIFA posing as Patriots!! I think you know this!! @realDonaldTrump @ALEXNEWMAN_JOU @RealJamesWoods @ksorbs — Geri Ungurean (@GGirl422) January 6, 2021

No, all of this has been carefully crafter and organized over the last 4 years, and the Democrats will emerge victorious, America will become a Marxist nation, and honestly, there is very little if anything you can do about it. You could pray, but if this is God’s judgment on America, then prayer will do very little. If you’re saved, pray and ask God to give YOU boldness in these last days, as the greatest, most-powerful nation that has ever existed is brought to it’s knees by its own leaders. But then, we told you that 12 years ago, remember? Take a close look especially at the lower left-hand corner of the graphic below. This was the first piece of art I ever created for Now The End Begins, and today it begins to be fulfilled.

These Are Mostly ANTIFA, Not Trump Supporters

Look at all the little hooligans wearing black backpacks, that is not how Trump supporters dress. But it is how Mormons dress, these are likely not Mormons, and it is how ANTIFA dresses. Everyone you see here in a black backpack are all likely ANTIFA militants.

Watch Congress' contentious session to count electoral votes and formalize Biden's win,"Members of Congress are meeting Wednesday afternoon to certify President-elect Joe Biden as the winner of the 2020 election.

Lawmakers will formalize Biden's victory Wednesday by counting electoral votes, as President Trump continues to challenge the results over baseless allegations of widespread voter fraud. Some Republicans are objecting to the tally in certain states, including House Minority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.), who announced his plans to do so not long before the session began.

Trump had been pressuring Pence to take action during the session to overturn the election results despite his lack of authority to do so, but Pence in a statement Wednesday said his ""oath to support and defend the Constitution constrains me from claiming unilateral authority to determine which electoral votes should be counted and which should not.""

According to The Washington Post, ""what is a normally quick and easy process could get dragged into the wee hours,"" and The New York Times writes that ""bipartisan majorities in both chambers are prepared to meet late into the night to beat back the challenges and confirm Mr. Biden as the winner."" Watch the process play out below.

Rep. Jordan: Dems changed rules in 'unconstitutional fashion' because 'they knew they couldn't win',"The Conversation

Mike Pence has remained one of the only constants in the often chaotic Trump administration.Variously described as “vanilla,” “steady” and loyal to the point of being “sycophantic,” he is, in the words of one profile, an “everyman’s man with Midwest humility and approachability,” and in another, a “61-year-old, soft-spoken, deeply religious man.”But that humility and loyalty are being tested as his tenure as vice president draws to an end. “I hope Mike Pence comes through for us,” Trump told supporters at a rally on Monday, seemingly under the mistaken belief that Pence can overturn the election result as he presides over the Electoral College vote count at a joint session of Congress today. Balancing the ticketThroughout the past four years, the vice president has offered a striking contrast to the mercurial, abrasive temperament of his commander in chief. Indeed, in his acceptance speech at the 2016 Republican National Convention, Pence joked that he’d been chosen because Trump, with his “large personality,” “colorful style,” and “lots of charisma,” was “looking for some balance on the ticket.” Commentators have attributed Pence’s steadiness to his Hoosier roots and his “savvy political operator” skills. But it is his religious beliefs that perhaps inform his politics and style more than anything else; as Pence has oft repeated, he is “a Christian, conservative and Republican – in that order.” In a 2011 profile during Pence’s run for Indiana governor, noted state political columnist Brian Howey remarked, “Pence doesn’t just wear his faith on his sleeve, he wears the whole Jesus jersey.”It isn’t a characterization that Pence has shied away from. “My Christian faith is at the very heart of who I am,” Pence said during the 2016 vice presidential debate.Richard Land, former president of the Southern Baptist Convention’s Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission and current president of Southern Evangelical Seminary in Charlotte, told the Atlantic in 2018, “Mike Pence is the 24-karat-gold model of what we want in an evangelical politician. I don’t know anyone who’s more consistent in bringing his evangelical Christian worldview to public policy.” But as a scholar of U.S. religion and culture, I believe that Pence’s faith and political identities are more complex than these statements suggest. In fact, one can trace three distinct conversion experiences in his biography. Three-point conversionGrowing up in an Irish Catholic family with five siblings, working-class roots and Democratic political commitments, Pence attended Catholic school, served as an altar boy at his family’s church, idolized John F. Kennedy and was a youth coordinator for the local Democratic Party in his teens.It was as a freshman at Hanover College in 1978 that Pence experienced an evangelical conversion while attending a music festival in Kentucky billed as the “Christian Woodstock.”For some years afterward he remained active in the Catholic Church, attending Mass regularly, serving as a youth minister and seriously considering joining the priesthood. At the same time, he and his future wife Karen were part of a demographic shift of Americans who “had grown up Catholic and still loved many things about the Catholic Church, but also really loved the concept of having a very personal relationship with Christ,” as a close friend put it.By the mid-1990s he was a married father of three who identified as a “born-again, evangelical Catholic,” an unusual term that has caused some consternation among both evangelicals and Catholics.In subsequent interviews, Pence has spoken freely about how his 1978 conversion gave him a “personal relationship with Jesus Christ” that “changed everything.” But he has tended to avoid labeling his religious views when pressed, referring to himself as a “pretty ordinary Christian” who “cherishes his Catholic upbringing.” He has attended nondenominational evangelical churches with his family since at least 1995. Pence’s political conversion was more clear cut. Though he voted for Jimmy Carter in the 1980 presidential election, he quickly came to embrace Ronald Reagan’s economic and social conservatism and his populist appeal. In a 2016 speech at the Reagan Library, Pence credited Reagan with inspiring him to “leave the party of my youth and become a Republican like he did.” “His broad-shouldered leadership changed my life,” he said. Pence has frequently compared Trump to Reagan, arguing that they have the same “broad shoulders.”Pence ran unsuccessfully for Congress in 1988 and 1990, and the second bruising loss precipitated a third conversion, this time in political style. In a 1991 published essay titled “Confessions of a Negative Campaigner,” he described himself as a sinner and wrote of his “conversion” to the belief that “negative campaigning is wrong.” Between 1992 and 1999, Pence honed his blend of family values and fiscal conservatism in an eponymous conservative talk show.The show’s popularity provided a springboard to a successful run for Congress in 2000. During his six terms in the House, Pence acquired a reputation for “unalloyed traditional conservatism” and principled opposition to Republican Party leadership on issues like No Child Left Behind and Medicare prescription drug expansion. Religious actsIn addition to his “unsullied” reputation as a “culture warrior,” he also attracted attention for following the “Billy Graham Rule” of avoiding meeting with women alone and avoiding events where alcohol was served when his wife was not present. During the 2016 vice presidential debate, Pence said that his entire career in public service stems from a commitment to “live out” his religious beliefs, “however imperfectly.”One of those beliefs is his opposition to abortion, grounded in his reading of particular biblical passages. As a congressman in 2007, he was the first to sponsor legislation defunding Planned Parenthood, and did so repeatedly until the first defunding bill passed in 2011. “I long for the day when Roe v. Wade is sent to the ash heap of history,” he said at the time.In 2016, over the objections of many Republican state representatives, he signed the most restrictive set of anti-abortion measures in the country into law, making him a conservative hero. Among other things, the bill prevented women from terminating pregnancies for reasons including fetal disability such as Down syndrome. Although opponents succeeded in getting the bill overturned in the courts, Indiana is still seen as one of the most anti-abortion states in America.As vice president, Pence also cast the tie-breaking Senate vote to allow states to withhold federal family planning funds from Planned Parenthood in 2017.Pence has also been an outspoken opponent of LGBTQ rights. He opposed the inclusion of sexual orientation in hate crimes legislation and the end of the military’s “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” policy. He likewise supported both state and federal constitutional amendments to ban same-sex marriage, and expressed disappointment at the 2015 Obergefell decision, which required all states to recognize such unions.At the same time he has been a strong supporter of “religious freedom,” particularly for Christians.In March 2015, as Indiana governor, he signed the state’s Religious Freedom Restoration Act “to ensure that religious liberty is fully protected.” The act ignited a firestorm of nationwide controversy: Critics alleged that it would allow for individuals and businesses to legally discriminate against members of the LGBTQ community. Under pressure from LGBTQ activists, liberals, business owners and moderate Republicans, Pence signed an amendment a week later stipulating that it did not authorize discrimination. Staked reputationPence’s religious and political biography mirrors key political and religious shifts over the past 40 years, from the rise of the religious right and its growing influence in the Republican Party to the conservative coalition of evangelicals and Catholics across denominational lines, to the legacy of the “outsider” celebrity president.These threads converge in Mike Pence, whose “24-karat,” “unalloyed” conservative credentials were instrumental in rallying evangelical voters behind Trump in the 2016 election and who has staked his political future on continuing to defend him.This article is republished from The Conversation, a nonprofit news site dedicated to sharing ideas from academic experts.

Washington DC riots - live: ‘Shots fired’ heard on police radio as armed Trump supporters storm Capitol OLD,"(Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Image)

Tear gas was fired inside the House as armed pro-Trump rioters stormed the US Capitol.

An armed standoff occurred in the House chamber and a rioter even got into the Senate chamber to sit in the presiding officer’s chair, where Mike Pence had been earlier.

Capitol police locked down the Capitol as the president’s right-wing supporters breached security lines and entered the building to reject his 2020 election loss to Joe Biden.

The violent crowd clashed with police on the steps of the Capitol Building during the joint session before they stormed and overran the Capitol Building.

Neighbouring congressional office buildings were under evacuation orders as confrontations become increasingly violent with tear gas being deployed and punches being thrown.

Vice president Mike Pence was quickly evacuated by Secret Service agents as officials quickly lost control of the shocking situation.

Washington DC mayor Muriel Bowser ordered a 6pm curfew in the city as the situation spun wildly out of control and Capitol Police asked for additional law enforcement support.

Earlier Mike Pence refused to overturn the election for Donald Trump as supporters of the outgoing president became embroiled in fights with police outside the Capitol.

Moments before the joint session the vice president broke with his boss and issued a statement saying he did not have the constitutional authority to intervene, as demanded by Mr Trump.

Congressional Republicans made the first objection of the joint session of Congress, challenging Arizona’s 11 electoral college votes going to president-elect Joe Biden.

Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell also refused to help Mr Trump overturn his election defeat, telling the high chamber that if Joe Biden’s victory was overturned “by mere allegations from the losing side, our democracy would enter a death spiral.”

Trump tells backers to 'go home' after Capitol stormed,"The Conversation

Mike Pence has remained one of the only constants in the often chaotic Trump administration.Variously described as “vanilla,” “steady” and loyal to the point of being “sycophantic,” he is, in the words of one profile, an “everyman’s man with Midwest humility and approachability,” and in another, a “61-year-old, soft-spoken, deeply religious man.”But that humility and loyalty are being tested as his tenure as vice president draws to an end. “I hope Mike Pence comes through for us,” Trump told supporters at a rally on Monday, seemingly under the mistaken belief that Pence can overturn the election result as he presides over the Electoral College vote count at a joint session of Congress today. Balancing the ticketThroughout the past four years, the vice president has offered a striking contrast to the mercurial, abrasive temperament of his commander in chief. Indeed, in his acceptance speech at the 2016 Republican National Convention, Pence joked that he’d been chosen because Trump, with his “large personality,” “colorful style,” and “lots of charisma,” was “looking for some balance on the ticket.” Commentators have attributed Pence’s steadiness to his Hoosier roots and his “savvy political operator” skills. But it is his religious beliefs that perhaps inform his politics and style more than anything else; as Pence has oft repeated, he is “a Christian, conservative and Republican – in that order.” In a 2011 profile during Pence’s run for Indiana governor, noted state political columnist Brian Howey remarked, “Pence doesn’t just wear his faith on his sleeve, he wears the whole Jesus jersey.”It isn’t a characterization that Pence has shied away from. “My Christian faith is at the very heart of who I am,” Pence said during the 2016 vice presidential debate.Richard Land, former president of the Southern Baptist Convention’s Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission and current president of Southern Evangelical Seminary in Charlotte, told the Atlantic in 2018, “Mike Pence is the 24-karat-gold model of what we want in an evangelical politician. I don’t know anyone who’s more consistent in bringing his evangelical Christian worldview to public policy.” But as a scholar of U.S. religion and culture, I believe that Pence’s faith and political identities are more complex than these statements suggest. In fact, one can trace three distinct conversion experiences in his biography. Three-point conversionGrowing up in an Irish Catholic family with five siblings, working-class roots and Democratic political commitments, Pence attended Catholic school, served as an altar boy at his family’s church, idolized John F. Kennedy and was a youth coordinator for the local Democratic Party in his teens.It was as a freshman at Hanover College in 1978 that Pence experienced an evangelical conversion while attending a music festival in Kentucky billed as the “Christian Woodstock.”For some years afterward he remained active in the Catholic Church, attending Mass regularly, serving as a youth minister and seriously considering joining the priesthood. At the same time, he and his future wife Karen were part of a demographic shift of Americans who “had grown up Catholic and still loved many things about the Catholic Church, but also really loved the concept of having a very personal relationship with Christ,” as a close friend put it.By the mid-1990s he was a married father of three who identified as a “born-again, evangelical Catholic,” an unusual term that has caused some consternation among both evangelicals and Catholics.In subsequent interviews, Pence has spoken freely about how his 1978 conversion gave him a “personal relationship with Jesus Christ” that “changed everything.” But he has tended to avoid labeling his religious views when pressed, referring to himself as a “pretty ordinary Christian” who “cherishes his Catholic upbringing.” He has attended nondenominational evangelical churches with his family since at least 1995. Pence’s political conversion was more clear cut. Though he voted for Jimmy Carter in the 1980 presidential election, he quickly came to embrace Ronald Reagan’s economic and social conservatism and his populist appeal. In a 2016 speech at the Reagan Library, Pence credited Reagan with inspiring him to “leave the party of my youth and become a Republican like he did.” “His broad-shouldered leadership changed my life,” he said. Pence has frequently compared Trump to Reagan, arguing that they have the same “broad shoulders.”Pence ran unsuccessfully for Congress in 1988 and 1990, and the second bruising loss precipitated a third conversion, this time in political style. In a 1991 published essay titled “Confessions of a Negative Campaigner,” he described himself as a sinner and wrote of his “conversion” to the belief that “negative campaigning is wrong.” Between 1992 and 1999, Pence honed his blend of family values and fiscal conservatism in an eponymous conservative talk show.The show’s popularity provided a springboard to a successful run for Congress in 2000. During his six terms in the House, Pence acquired a reputation for “unalloyed traditional conservatism” and principled opposition to Republican Party leadership on issues like No Child Left Behind and Medicare prescription drug expansion. Religious actsIn addition to his “unsullied” reputation as a “culture warrior,” he also attracted attention for following the “Billy Graham Rule” of avoiding meeting with women alone and avoiding events where alcohol was served when his wife was not present. During the 2016 vice presidential debate, Pence said that his entire career in public service stems from a commitment to “live out” his religious beliefs, “however imperfectly.”One of those beliefs is his opposition to abortion, grounded in his reading of particular biblical passages. As a congressman in 2007, he was the first to sponsor legislation defunding Planned Parenthood, and did so repeatedly until the first defunding bill passed in 2011. “I long for the day when Roe v. Wade is sent to the ash heap of history,” he said at the time.In 2016, over the objections of many Republican state representatives, he signed the most restrictive set of anti-abortion measures in the country into law, making him a conservative hero. Among other things, the bill prevented women from terminating pregnancies for reasons including fetal disability such as Down syndrome. Although opponents succeeded in getting the bill overturned in the courts, Indiana is still seen as one of the most anti-abortion states in America.As vice president, Pence also cast the tie-breaking Senate vote to allow states to withhold federal family planning funds from Planned Parenthood in 2017.Pence has also been an outspoken opponent of LGBTQ rights. He opposed the inclusion of sexual orientation in hate crimes legislation and the end of the military’s “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” policy. He likewise supported both state and federal constitutional amendments to ban same-sex marriage, and expressed disappointment at the 2015 Obergefell decision, which required all states to recognize such unions.At the same time he has been a strong supporter of “religious freedom,” particularly for Christians.In March 2015, as Indiana governor, he signed the state’s Religious Freedom Restoration Act “to ensure that religious liberty is fully protected.” The act ignited a firestorm of nationwide controversy: Critics alleged that it would allow for individuals and businesses to legally discriminate against members of the LGBTQ community. Under pressure from LGBTQ activists, liberals, business owners and moderate Republicans, Pence signed an amendment a week later stipulating that it did not authorize discrimination. Staked reputationPence’s religious and political biography mirrors key political and religious shifts over the past 40 years, from the rise of the religious right and its growing influence in the Republican Party to the conservative coalition of evangelicals and Catholics across denominational lines, to the legacy of the “outsider” celebrity president.These threads converge in Mike Pence, whose “24-karat,” “unalloyed” conservative credentials were instrumental in rallying evangelical voters behind Trump in the 2016 election and who has staked his political future on continuing to defend him.This article is republished from The Conversation, a nonprofit news site dedicated to sharing ideas from academic experts.

US intelligence agencies have issued a rare public statement claiming that the Solarwinds hack was 'likely Russian in nature',"SolarWinds Corp banner hangs at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) on the IPO day of the company in New York, U.S., October 19, 2018 REUTERS/Brendan McDermid

A joint US intelligence task force issued an urgent and initial public reaction to the Solarwinds hack, alleging that the campaign was likely the work of Russian hackers.

The statement claimed that the hack was ""a serious compromise that will require a sustained and dedicated effort to remediate.""

The task force also confirmed that the Treasury, the Departments of State, Homeland Security, Commerce, and Energy were breached in an ""intelligence-gathering effort.""

The Cyber Unified Coordination Group was formed by the White House in response to the hack and consists of the FBI, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, and the National Security Agency.

A joint task force of investigative US government agencies issued a statement Tuesday charging that the massive Solarwinds hack was 'likely Russian in nature.'

The statement, which was also signed onto by the FBI, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, and the National Security Agency, marked a rare unified, public response to the hack.

Noting that investigations into the hack are still underway, the statement said that ""an Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) actor, likely Russian in origin, is responsible for most or all of the recently discovered, ongoing cyber compromises of both government and non-governmental networks.""

The statement added that the hack was likely ""an intelligence-gathering effort.""

Tuesday's joint statement marked the first cohesive response from the intelligence community since the hack was identified, and it contradicted Trump's claims last month that Chinese hackers were responsible.

The statement added that the hack was ""a serious compromise that will require a sustained and dedicated effort to remediate,"" adding that since discovering the hack, private sector and US government employees have worked to contain it.

Story continues

The joint task force also offered additional clarity on which US agencies were targeted.

The statement alleged that less than ten federal bodies had networks breached, but those agencies included the Treasury, as well as the Departments of State, Homeland Security, Commerce, and Energy.

Russian presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov, as well as the Russian embassy in the US, have denied orchestrating the attacks. A statement issued on the embassy's Facebook page on December 13 said: ""Malicious activities in the information space contradict the principles of the Russian foreign policy, national interests and our understanding of interstate relations,"" adding, ""Russia does not conduct offensive operations in the cyber domain.""

The hack took place over the course of several months, likely beginning as early as March. Hackers reportedly entered the SolarWinds system - which monitors servers in order to prevent outages - via patch updates made by SolarWinds in March and June.

As hackers put corrupted code into Solarwinds updates, at least 18,000 Solarwinds customers in the public and private sector installed tainted updates, according to US intelligence agencies.

The hack was publicly reported last month after global cybersecurity firm FireEye detected the supply chain attack, alleging that their own networks were also compromised.

Judge orders LSU to turn over complete police report sought in USA TODAY lawsuit,"After a nearly five-month battle, an East Baton Rouge Parish District Court judge fined Louisiana State University and ordered the school to give USA TODAY an unredacted copy of a 2016 police report that names former star running back Derrius Guice.

LSU “was unreasonable, arbitrary and capricious in its refusal and delay and the redacted manner in which the documents were produced,” Judge Janice Clark wrote in her Dec. 29 ruling.

Clark further ordered LSU to pay $10,000 for USA TODAY’s attorney fees and an additional $6,200 in civil penalties — $100 for each of the 62 business days between the request date and the trial date, Nov. 23.

USA TODAY and Samantha Brennan, a former student who worked part-time in LSU’s football recruiting office, sued LSU in October after it refused to turn over a report that blacked out key details, including her and Guice’s names. Brennan had reported Guice to campus police in July 2016, after she was told that Guice had taken a partially nude photograph of her without her knowledge and shared it with others on the football team.

“We're thrilled for the reporters, and especially for Samantha, the victim in this matter,” said Scott Sternberg, a New Orleans lawyer who represented USA TODAY in the case. “The public records law, and common sense, lean in favor of the public's right to know—and here the Judge agreed that LSU's excuses and redactions were wrong.

“By awarding fees, costs, and sanctions of $100 per day, the Judge added an exclamation point that we hope will resonate through this campus and others.”

LSU has appealed Clark’s ruling.

SPECIAL REPORT: LSU mishandled sexual misconduct complaints against students, including top athletes

Brennan initially reported the allegations to two top athletic department administrators: her then-boss, football recruiting director Sharon Lewis, and Senior Associate Athletic Director Miriam Segar, who Brennan said encouraged her to file a police report and accompanied her to the police station to do so.

Story continues

Federal and university Title IX policies required all employees who learned of sexual misconduct allegations to report them to the school’s Title IX coordinator, who must conduct an initial investigation. That did not happen in Brennan’s case — Brennan said that no one from the Title IX office ever reached out to her about an investigation or to offer support services.

After Brennan read USA TODAY’s August investigation about two students’ rape allegations against Guice that went uninvestigated by LSU, she contacted the reporters to say she, too, had an incident with Guice. On Aug. 19, Brennan called the LSU police department and requested a copy of her police report.

After several delays, LSU sent her a one-page, four-sentence “initial report.” It lacked numerous details, including Guice’s name and her claim that he’d shared the photo with others, which is a felony under Louisiana law.

When Brennan asked for the rest of the file, two LSU officials told her she could not have it because the statute of limitations in the case had not expired.

USA TODAY had previously asked LSU for copies of all campus police reports involving Guice. In response, LSU provided reports for two non-criminal incidents involving him, but did not provide Brennan’s report nor mention its existence.

USA TODAY and Brennan sued LSU for access to the full report in October.

“I am overjoyed by Judge Clark's ruling,” Brennan told USA TODAY. “This has never been about me. As I testified in court, I want my unredacted police report to give credibility to all of the victims out there that are being accused of not reporting and using this as a payday. We did report, and I, specifically, did report to the most official department.

“LSU cannot keep covering up their actions, and clearly Judge Clark agreed.”

On Nov. 16, USA TODAY published an investigation, featuring accounts from Brennan and other students’, showing how the university’s athletic department and broader administration repeatedly have ignored complaints against abusers, denied victims’ requests for protections and subjected them to further harm by known perpetrators.

The same day, LSU announced it was hiring an outside law firm, Husch Blackwell, to investigate its handling of the allegations mentioned in USA TODAY’s reporting, as well as a sample of more than 50 others from 2016 to 2018.

Two days later, and after months of stonewalling, LSU turned over the remaining pages of the police report to Brennan and USA TODAY. But the university continued to shield the names of everyone in the report except the officers.

In the November trial, attorneys for LSU argued that because no arrests were made, those involved in the incident – including Guice – have a right to privacy under the state constitution. LSU even objected to Sternberg mentioning Guice by name during the hearing.

“I hope LSU will stop trying to give victims run arounds when they try to obtain their own records,” Brennan told USA TODAY. “LSU gave me obstacle after obstacle to try to keep me from my police report, but they did not prevail.

“This is a win for all of the victims out there that have not received the justice they deserve.”

White House Task Force: Give Extra Vaccine Away to Anyone Who Wants It,"Photo Illustration by Sarah Rogers/The Daily Beast / Photos Getty

Senior officials working with the White House coronavirus task force and Operation Warp Speed are pushing for states to begin handing out some of their excess COVID-19 vaccine doses to whoever wants it, according to four individuals familiar with the matter.

The plan is already in motion, with federal officials already talking to states about it. If further enacted, the shift in distribution could upend months of debate and strategizing about who should get the vaccine first. But officials argue that this first-come, first-served approach may be one of the only ways to ensure that millions of vaccine doses don’t expire on the shelf. So far, 24 million doses have been allocated to states, with roughly 28 percent of those doses administered.

President Donald Trump at one point said there would be 100 million doses prepared by the end of 2020. More recently, officials said they would have 20 million doses administered by then. That didn’t happen. In mid-December states began to report a range of issues—deliveries of doses delayed, vaccination reporting systems shutting down. And as the New Year rolled by, the administration had still not reached its target.

‘It’s Gone Too Slowly’: California Changes Rules as Vaccine Rollout Falters

Hundreds Hit COVID Vaccine Jackpot After Hospital Freezer Meltdown

While administration officials, citing everything from production and quality control sluggishness to allocation scheduling conflicts, have admitted there was a slight lag in getting the first batches out to states, they have repeatedly told their local counterparts that distribution would soon get back on track. Internally, though, federal officials in recent days have begun to worry that there are issues at every step in the supply chain that could further slow the vaccination rate. A surprising number of healthcare and frontline workers haven’t shown up for their vaccinations or are refusing to get them. (According to a Los Angeles Times report, one hospital in northern California has vaccinated less than half of its staff.) Refrigerators have broken, spoiling dozens of doses. And states have struggled to find enough individuals to administer the vaccines.

Story continues

“If we have a big surge in cases and deaths after the December holidays and we don’t have the vaccine distribution plan back on course we’re in big trouble,” one senior administration official said.

As part of the conversations about how to quickly improve distribution, officials in task force meetings, in interagency phone calls and in a Camp David summit Tuesday suggested that states should distribute the vaccine—doses that may soon expire—to any individuals who want to get inoculated. These people would get the vaccine, even if they are not frontline healthcare workers, essential workers, over the age of 75 years old. There has been no formal decision to draft recommendations in this vein, officials said they are not against states pursuing this course of action and have transmitted to some local officials that they should embrace the idea. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar and other top Operation Warp Speed officials met at Camp David Tuesday to discuss the next two weeks of the vaccination rollout and the transition to the Biden administration.

“We need to make sure that the critically ill and most vulnerable people are getting this vaccine first,” one senior administration official said. “But after that if there are doses that are just sitting in fridges expiring, we got to get them out there.”

Senior administration officials working on the vaccine distribution process are adamant that allowing vaccine doses to be thrown out is not an option and that local officials should allow for their distribution to anyone who wants them. The question, officials said, is how states regulate that process and keep track of who has been vaccinated, when they need to receive their second doses, and whether the state has enough doses to ensure each recipient gets both doses.

There are signs that individual hospitals and pharmacies are already taking the first-come, first-served approach. On Monday news broke that Giant pharmacy in Washington, D.C. had given a vaccine shot to someone walking through the store because the healthcare workers who were scheduled to receive their shot did not show up. In Louisville, a couple received vaccine shots at Walgreens on Christmas Eve after they heard that there were extra available. And a California hospital gave away hundreds of doses to jail and nursing home staff after its freezer malfunctioned.

“The releasing of the vaccine if it isn’t going to be unused… if it’s been thawed… we should absolutely get rid of this stuff,” said Juliette Kayyem, a former assistant secretary in the Department of Homeland Security. “I think local ingenuity is really important. It should be welcomed. You want nimbleness at the local level with money coming with from the feds.”

It’s all part of a broader conversation within the administration’s health agencies and among White House task force members about why the vaccine rollout has been so bumpy. The vaccination effort was always going to be complicated—it’s the largest such campaign in American history, after all—there was some confusion on the state’s part from the beginning about exactly how much federal support they’d receive in the administering process once Operation Warp Speed shipped the vaccine.

Anthony Fauci Reveals His Biggest COVID Vaccine Fear

For officials in the federal government working on Operation Warp Speed overseeing the distribution campaign, no one can seem to decide why the vaccination numbers nationwide are so low. Some officials said it’s because states aren’t doing their jobs at getting people to sign up and show for their vaccination appointments. Others say the public education about the vaccination process and its efficiency has been woefully inadequate.

What’s more, every state is experiencing the vaccination distribution differently. Some states are experiencing long lines of individuals showing up for their shots. Other states seem to be struggling to get the vaccines out of the freezer into people’s arms.

Officials inside the administration’s major health agencies, including the CDC and HHS, say one of the biggest problems is the lack of an accurate and reliable vaccination reporting system. One official said some states are asking individuals to sign on to state and municipal-run databases after their vaccination to report that they have received their shots and not everyone does so. Another official said there is no centralized reporting system that states can use to report their numbers to the CDC. Officials inside the CDC have wanted to work more intently on accumulating, aggregating, and analyzing the data but there has been pushback from the White House and other senior health officials, one senior official said.

One senior official told The Daily Beast that as part of the hours-long meeting Camp David meeting Tuesday, officials discussed the need for states to hand out the vaccine to individuals outside of the frontline health-care worker population if there are leftover doses. They also put together a plan to work with states over the next two weeks to ensure that vaccine shipments are sent to pharmacies instead of health-care departments or hospitals as a way to make the distribution process easier and more manageable. Operation Warp Speed officials hope to use the partnership with more than 19 pharmacy chains in 40,00 locations across the country to scale distribution by February.

Why Did This Swanky High-Rise in Houston Get Vaccines Ahead of Most People?

The more pressing question, one senior administration official said, is how the Trump administration and the incoming Biden team tackle vaccine hesitancy. If individuals refuse to get the vaccine—especially frontline workers—it will take months longer to reach widespread immunity through vaccination. To that end, individual members of the Trump administration’s White House coronavirus task force have taken it upon themselves to speak with the media and appear virtually at private events to tout the vaccine’s efficacy.

HHS has also launched a campaign known as “Vaccinate with Confidence” to increase education on the issue. The goal of the campaign is to reinforce the safety of the vaccine—and the importance of slowing the spread—in part through promotional videos and advertisements. One December social media campaign titled “Prepare the Nation'” has reached users on Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and Pinterest. As of last week the campaign had 74 million impressions and 7 million video views, according to an HHS presentation obtained by The Daily Beast.

Trump’s New ‘Volunteer’ Lawyer Specializes in Election B.S.,"Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast/Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP

President Donald Trump’s revolving door of legal advisers has spun faster than ever in recent weeks as his attempts to overturn the 2020 election have grown more desperate. And in a recording published on Sunday, a now infamous conference call between Trump and Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger revealed that the star conservative attorney Cleta Mitchell had apparently joined the fold as the president’s latest free lawyer.

Over the course of the phone call, first published by The Washington Post, Mitchell could be heard going to bat for Team Trump’s anti-democratic interests.

“I think what the president is saying and what we’ve been trying to do is to say, look, the court is not acting on our petition. They haven’t even assigned a judge,” Mitchell told Raffensperger after a blistering rant from Trump about the secretary of state’s unwillingness to change the results of the election. “But the people of Georgia and the people of America have a right to know the answers and you have data and records that we don’t have access to. And you keep telling us and making public statements that you investigated this and, you know, nothing to see here.”

Until her name appeared in the Post story, Mitchell had conducted her legal work for Trump and his team almost entirely out of the public eye, instead opting to appear sporadically on Trump-friendly media, mostly without disclosing her own role. In one little-noticed podcast appearance, she described herself as a “volunteer” with the Trump campaign’s long, long, long shot legal battle. Though the extent of her current role in Trump’s cause had not been widely known prior to this week—not even to her own law firm, apparently—knowledgeable sources say that it was underway before Thanksgiving.

Moreover, Mitchell had previously repped Trump in a 2011 matter, according to official documents and contemporaneous accounts.

She wasn’t a big presence in the media officially representing the president’s post-election legal team, unlike Trump lawyers such as Rudy Giuliani, Jenna Ellis, or the on-again-off-again Trump adviser Sidney Powell, and her name has been absent from the past two months of legal paperwork or court filings that Trump’s team has lodged during the president’s flailing effort to nullify Joe Biden’s decisive victory in the 2020 presidential election, according to a Daily Beast review of records.

Story continues

But Mitchell’s involvement with Trump, his senior staff, and his legal team on baselessly challenging Biden’s win dates back roughly two months, according to two sources with knowledge of her presence on the team, as well as text messages reviewed by The Daily Beast. In behind the scenes work and legal paperwork, she has become the Team Trump point person for attempting to overturn the voting results in Georgia and has been in contact with Trump and the White House multiple times on these efforts since November. She is viewed by others on the legal team and Trump’s staff as being an ally of Mark Meadows, Trump’s White House chief of staff.

It is unclear why Mitchell’s role was kept largely quiet for as long as it was, though she wouldn’t be the only lawyer who has worked with Trump’s legal team who’s also kept mostly silent about it. In late November, The Daily Beast reported that Christina Bobb, an on-air host at the Trump-endorsed channel One America News Network, had been quietly doing legal work for the president’s so-called “elite strike force,” and had been showing up at campaign headquarters. She did so without disclosing it in her TV coverage of the very same legal efforts.

Donald Trump’s Newest Lawyer Is a Kamala Harris Birther

Mitchell, the White House, a Trump campaign spokesman, and Giuliani did not respond to messages or phone calls seeking comment on this story. But on Monday, Mitchell’s own law firm put out a statement reacting to Sunday’s news of her role in President Trump’s anti-democratic mission in the lead-up to Biden’s inauguration in Washington, D.C., on January 20.

The firm did not sound pleased.

“Foley & Lardner LLP is not representing any parties seeking to contest the results of the presidential election,” the statement reads. “In November, the firm made a policy decision not to take on any representation of any party in connection with matters related to the presidential election results. Our policy did allow our attorneys to participate in observing election recounts and similar actions on a voluntary basis in their individual capacity as private citizens so long as they did not act as legal advisers. We are aware of, and are concerned by, Ms. Mitchell’s participation in the January 2 conference call and are working to understand her involvement more thoroughly.”

Reached on Monday afternoon, the firm’s spokesman, Dan Farrell, said they didn’t “have more to share beyond” that official statement at this time.

Before Sunday’s call, Mitchell’s public involvement was mostly as an advocate in Trump-friendly media. She made two appearances on Fox Business with Maria Bartiromo to complain about (unsubstantiated) allegations of voter fraud after the election, on Nov. 10. “I've been in Georgia since the middle of the night” she mentioned offhand and said, “I hope to be talking to Mayor Giuliani today about what we're seeing in Georgia.”

In a separate appearance on Fox News with host Sandra Smith, Smith was caught on a hot mic rolling her eyes at Mitchell’s fraud allegations and muttering, “What is happening?”

In a November 30 podcast interview with Family Research Council president Tony Perkins, Mitchell said, “I’ve been working as a volunteer with the Trump campaign and the legal team in Georgia.""

In a separate interview a week later, she told Perkins, ""I'm a volunteer. We have some other volunteers helping because there's just so much that needed to be included. The goal was to create a public record that demonstrated the extent of the violations and the illegality.”

In her podcast interviews, Mitchell claimed that thousands of ineligible voters had voted in the election and laid the blame at the feet of Georgia Governor Brian Kemp and Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger. “This election was not valid. Those results are not valid. Whatever anybody says, those are not valid. The secretary of state has a lot to answer for,” she claimed groundlessly.

Over the years, Mitchell earned a reputation as a top-tier campaign finance lawyer for conservative candidates and activist groups with legal problems before the IRS and Federal Election Commission.

During the Obama presidency, Mitchell was a go-to lawyer for the Tea Party movement and the candidates it spawned. When Nevada state legislator Sharron Angle ran against Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid on a Tea Party platform, she hired Mitchell, who blasted the top Senate Democrat in a fundraising letter for allegedly trying to “steal this election if he can't win it outright"" through the alleged use of free food at campaign rallies.

Over the past few years, Mitchell has represented a who’s who of prominent Trumpworld people, including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Steve Bannon, and prominent conservative activist groups like the NRA and the Rebuilding America Now Super PAC founded by former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort in 2016.

When the IRS investigated and delayed granting tax-exempt status to a range of conservative nonprofits in the wake of the Citizens United decision, Mitchell represented True the Vote, a conservative activist group focused on election law, in a suit alleging that the IRS unfairly targeted the group based on its ideological affiliation.

Mitchell’s relationship with Trump dates back at least to 2011, when she represented him against a Federal Election Commission complaint, subsequently dismissed, which alleged that Trump and his attorney Michael Cohen violated campaign finance laws with illegal in-kind contributions when Trump mulled a run for president in 2012.

Shawn Thompson, a former campaign aide to then Rep. Ron Paul, “filed an FEC complaint against me for use of Trump’s 727 aircraft to go to Iowa in 2011,” Michael Cohen, Trump’s former personal attorney and fixer, told The Daily Beast on Monday. Cohen said he sought out Mitchell to fight the complaint on the strength of her reputation as a skilled campaign finance law attorney.

At the time, she didn’t have a close working relationship with Trump, Cohen said, but her victory in getting the complaint dismissed did create an impression. By the time the 2016 campaign began, “Donald Trump already saw her as a winner,” according to Cohen’s account.

The two have appeared to grow closer in recent years. Trump invited Mitchell to a White House ceremony commemorating the centenary of women’s suffrage in August 2020 and singled her out for praise as “a great attorney... beyond an attorney.”

"Carnival Cruise Line, Princess Cruises cancels more US cruises into late spring","Princess Cruises has announced it will cancel all cruises from U.S. ports through May 14 — more than a year after the industry came to a standstill in the middle of March last year.

Princess itself was impacted by the pandemic early on: two of its ships, the Diamond Princess and the Grand Princess, were among the first vessels to quarantine passengers because of coronavirus infections.

Previously, Princess Cruises had canceled all itineraries through March 31. The additional cancellations come as the cruise line works on restart plans that will meet the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's ""Framework For Conditional Sailing"" announced in October.

The further suspension also applies to European cruises scheduled prior to May 15, Negin Kamali, spokesperson for Princess Cruises, told USA TODAY.

Carnival Cruise Line also announced an extension to its sailing suspension, canceling cruises scheduled through March 31 in U.S. waters.

Carnival also canceled select domestic itineraries into fall and one international cruise internationally in June, according to a statement provided by spokesperson Vance Gulliksen.

While many of the schedule changes are in relation to pandemic-induced regulations, including voyage-length restrictions, some are also related to rescheduled dry-dock work.

The cancellations include:

All sailings from U.S. ports through March 31.

Carnival Freedom's April 10 sailing from Galveston.

Carnival Miracle's sailings from San Diego and San Francisco through Sept. 16.

Carnival Liberty's sailings from Port Canaveral from Sept. 17 through Oct. 18.

Carnival Sunshine's sailings from Charleston from Oct. 11 through Nov. 13.

Carnival Spirit's 15-day voyage from Singapore to Brisbane set to depart June 12.

“We are sorry to disappoint our guests, as we can see from our booking activity that there is clearly a pent-up demand for cruising on Carnival,” Christine Duffy, president of Carnival Cruise Line, said in the statement.

Story continues

Duffy added that the cruise line plans to resume operations in 2021 with a ""phased-in approach,"" a strategy the cruise line's parent company, Carnival Corp., has referenced frequently since the onset of the pandemic.

The cancellations come as the U.S. is seeing a continued upward trend in COVID-19 cases, reaching 21 million cases on Tuesday night, just over four days since reporting 20 million cases, Johns Hopkins data shows. And Georgia became the fifth state to report a case of the more contagious virus strain first identified in the United Kingdom, joining Colorado, California, Florida and New York.

Another Carnival Corp. subsidiary, P&O Cruises Australia, also announced Wednesday cancellations of its New Zealand cruises into April.

""P&O Cruises Australia is extending its rolling pause in operations in New Zealand to departures on and before 25 April, 2021, as the cruise line and the wider industry continue to work with government and public health authorities on the appropriate time to restart sailing,"" the company said in a statement provided by spokesperson Lindy Lamme.

The cruise line plans to return to New Zealand in July 2022 for a 150-day season in the area.

“We know that much better days lie ahead and we remain positive about the resumption of cruising. While we’ve paused operations, P&O Cruises together with the wider industry has been using the time wisely to plan for cruising’s return,” Sture Myrmell, president of the cruise line, said in the statement.

"The Toyota Yaris Is Such a Terrible Getaway Car, Porch Pirate Finds Out","But one tiny snowbank and a Toyota Yaris have succeeded where surveillance couldn’t. The latest viral video from Canada plays out like an SNL skit but actually happened in real life. And it should serve as warning that a Yaris is not a good getaway car – especially not if you have such poor driving skills as this porch pirate The video seems to have first emerged on Instagram, but it’s since been shared on Twitter and reddit . It was shot either in Mississauga or Brampton, which commenters describe as middle-class suburbs of Toronto.The video starts just as the homeowner opens the front door to catch a porch pirate in the act of stealing his package. “Yer done. Yer over,” the man tells the thief, who scrambles to the car he seems to have left running in the driveway. “So sorry,” the thief whispers sheepishly.He then jumps into the car and backs into the street. However, because he’s already panicking, he goes straight into a small snowbank on the side of the driveway and his Yaris gets stuck, with the front wheel suspended. The homeowner being a true Canadian, even offers a word of advice to the no-longer-fleeing thief, now in full panic mode: “It’s front-wheel drive, you need to get the wheel on the ground,” he tells him at one point and, “want me to get a shovel?”He doesn’t get the shovel. Instead, two cop cars arrive quickly and surround the still-stuck Yaris, and the officers pull the thief out when he seems to be taking far too long because he’d gotten thirsty. Considering how he must have been sweating as the realization dawned on him that he wouldn’t get out of the snow, hydration was a must.",['Elena Gorgan'],https://news.google.com,high
Dispatch from South Korea: Reflections on a year of innovative missionary work during COVID-19,"SEOUL, South Korea — Standing side by side with a sweet Catholic nun, I scooped Kimchi into a little plastic cup as I did my part in a box-lunch assembly line on a Tuesday in South Korea.

Every week our Seoul, Korea, missionaries tighten up their masks, don plastic gloves, and bright orange aprons and volunteer at Anna’s House — a charity that serves 600 box-lunches every day to the homeless. We completed the assembly process and went outside to the adjacent parking lot to pass out the food.

It was bitter cold and hundreds of people were waiting, 6 feet apart, for the distribution to begin. Our missionaries consider this service to be a highlight of their week. They know that even through a pandemic, people need to be served, they deserve a hot meal, they need a warm coat, they need to know that someone cares.

Perhaps that’s what we learned more than anything this past year. We all need to know that someone cares.

The charity is run by Father Vincenzo — a Catholic priest who moved to Korea from Italy 30 years ago. I love Father Vincenzo and his goodness. I have loved Italy ever since I served my young mission there 40 years ago. Now I love Korea too.

My husband, Brad Taylor presides over the Korea Seoul Mission and together for the past 2½ years we have served both the missionaries and the people here. COVID-19 turned 2020 into a crazy roller coaster of a year for all of us. But as we sit here on Christmas Eve and reflect on all that has transpired, we see nothing but small miracles that have occurred and rich learnings that we will take into the new year.

The beginning

In January, we starting hearing mumblings of a deadly virus in China.

In February, Korea became headline news around the world and we were instructed to go into isolation that we thought would last two weeks.

In March, we were shocked as our foreign missionaries were suddenly evacuated and we dropped overnight from a mission of 120 missionaries down to 30 native Korean elders and sisters. The temple closed. Church was canceled. We wondered, what do we do now?

We hunkered down, moved missionaries into centers of strength and gathered virtually through meetings held on Zoom to figure out how to move forward. Despite the fact that we never could have seen this coming, we were miraculously prepared: missionaries already had smartphones, they were already finding ways to work online, and we had already utilized Zoom meetings in order to cut down on travel. Now it was time to take it to the next level.

Our missionaries increased their efforts to teach the gospel through video calls, often including their evacuated foreign companions who were sitting in isolation back at home. We pushed our young missionaries to think outside the box, try new things, be creative, let your light shine!

They created new Facebook pages, Instagram accounts and YouTube channels. They started live “radio shows”, “rooftop live” virtual concerts and online English classes. YouTube, in particular, is incredibly popular here in Korea. We have literally reached millions of new people through this media alone. We were amazed by the creativity of our missionaries, their positivity and ability to adapt, endure and lift each other up through such a stressful time.

From negative to positive

One of the greatest challenges for missionary work in Korea has been misinformation about the church on the internet — a problem we have been trying to solve since we arrived in 2018. With so much indoor time and armed with our 100% native Korean mission, we pushed our missionaries to take time every day to post good stories about the church, our beliefs, the members and their testimonies.

President Taylor and I started holding Zoom firesides with all the stakes in Korea as well as LDS Korean congregations around the world in places like New York, New Jersey, Utah, Los Angeles, Vancouver and Hawaii, inviting them all to join in this effort. The results have been nothing short of miraculous as the most popular Korean search engine “Naver,” has now changed from a negative influence into an incredibly positive tool. Additionally, it has provided wonderful uplift for the members in this time of isolation to read so many inspiring posts.

The tide has turned and people are now finding us versus us always having to find them. It is a David vs. Goliath-type of miracle that we couldn’t have dreamed possible even one year ago.

The virus has connected our world in a way like nothing else as we have watched it skip over continents and across the seas. We have prayed together, mourned together and missionaries are working together like never before.

Korean missionaries originally assigned to other missions around the world were brought back and reassigned to serve here in Korea. By July, we had 38 missionaries with only one-third them originally called to serve in our mission. As we added in missionaries from more than 18 different missions we were able to incorporate new ideas and connections from around the globe.

Sister Kang Hanyoung was serving in the Angeles Philippines mission when she was pulled out and brought back home to Korea and reassigned to Seoul. It just so happens that we had started a new Filipino branch last year. Her service in that branch has been a great blessing to those members as well as to herself.

Elder Kim Dongmin was reassigned to us from the New York New York mission. He had been serving in the Bronx. He now is serving joyfully in a Korean city where a large Nigerian population exists. His efforts and influence in that area have been life-changing.

One sister who had an especially hard time growing up in Korea has shared with us that being brought back to her native country was heartbreaking at first, but as she has served her fellow Koreans she has developed a deep love for her homeland that she had previously lost.

Two of our elders are currently teaching a young man who is from Russia. A sister, who previously served in our mission but is now home in Russian-speaking Moldova, joins through technology on a regular basis to help teach this young man in his native tongue. He also uses Zoom to join in her Russian sacrament meetings from his home in Korea.

We are participating in “the global gathering of Israel.” Just one example: Our South Korean missionary (Elder Bae Jungil) went online and began teaching a Cameroon, Africa, woman who was now working as an engineer in New Delhi, India. She embraced the gospel and was ultimately baptized by an elder from New Zealand. Elder Bae participated and rejoiced in the baptism through technology.

If you had told me back in 1983 when I was serving in Italy, that something like this could happen, I would never have believed it!

Physical and mental health

We learned quickly that finding creative ways to get missionaries outside would be vital to their physical, emotional and mental health. As the virus guidelines ebbed and flowed, we created opportunities for safe mission preparation days that included biking around an island, hiking the mountain behind our home and holding outdoor zone conferences in a forest we affectionately refer to as our “Korean Sacred Grove.”

We also visited an historic monument honoring a miraculous battle fought by American Latter-day Saint soldiers.

During the summer months, the virus seemed to almost disappear. Our missionaries were teaching and baptizing at an even higher rate than before the virus. Church meetings returned in an adapted, social-distanced manner. But the ups and downs continued. By August cases started popping up again, restrictions were put back in place but missionary work carried on — we had a new normal.

Fast forward to November. We got word that our evacuated foreign missionaries could begin to come back. Most had already finished their missions, but four have made it back. We tearfully welcomed them at the airport from 6 feet away through masks.

They had to quarantine for 14 days AGAIN! For many of them this is the third or fourth or fifth time. Their Korean brothers and sisters are excited to have them back. They bring with them energy and excitement, hope and happiness! They bring with them their love for a country they were just barely getting to know.

December has brought a new spike in the virus — more cases than ever and even stricter constraints: Five or more people gathering for social purposes is banned until Jan. 3, 2021. But there is no panic, no fear … we’ve been here before. We are at 40 missionaries and we will keep on doing what we’re doing. We will keep sharing our light.

The opportunity we have had to develop deep personal relationships with this small band of missionaries has been an indescribable blessing. We have watched them not just survive this storm but thrive. Their increased opportunity for leadership, caring for each other and reaching out to both members of the church and others in the community is preparing them to lead here in Korea for years to come.

In Korea, 2021 is the Year of the Ox. People born in the Year of the Ox are “industrious, hold their faith firmly, and are always glad to offer help.” I think this perfectly describes the aspirations of the Korea Seoul Mission for the coming year!

"As Britain Enters a Crisis Period, a Reprieve of Sorts for Johnson","LONDON — For months, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has been whipsawed by the forces of the pandemic, caught between an opposition that accused him of acting too late and lawmakers in his own party who complained that he had gone too far in locking down Britain’s economy to curb the coronavirus.

On Wednesday, however, Mr. Johnson went to Parliament with some of his toughest measures yet, and the chamber’s unruly backbenches were quiet. So dire is the public health crisis now confronting Britain that it has temporarily stilled the political debates that have raged since the virus first emerged in the country 11 months ago.

Mr. Johnson won overwhelming approval of the legislation to impose a new national lockdown, which he said could remain in force until March 31, although it is possible some of the measures could be relaxed before then.

“As was the case last spring, our emergence from the lockdown cocoon will be not a big bang but a gradual unwrapping,” Mr. Johnson declared in Parliament, adding that the government would lift the restrictions “if they are no longer deemed necessary to limit the transmission of the virus.”","['Mark Landler', 'Stephen Castle']",https://news.google.com,high

France launches service to make deadbeat parents pay,"France launches service to make deadbeat parents pay France is launching a new government service empowered to take money directly from the bank accounts of parents who fail to pay child support

PARIS -- France is launching a new government service empowered to take money directly from the bank accounts of parents who fail to pay child support, aiming to help many families — the vast majority of whom are headed by single mothers — emerge from precarious financial situations.

President Emmanuel Macron denounced in a tweet unpaid child support as “an unbearable situation for hundreds of thousands of single parents,” before visiting a benefits agency Tuesday in Tours, in central France, which is providing the new service.

“Thank you” for the measure, a single mother of three told Macron, detailing at length her personal situation, involving domestic violence and harassment from her ex-husband and deep financial difficulties. “That's a great relief,"" she said.

The mothers who spoke with Macron didn't provide their names because of privacy reasons.

French authorities estimate that between 30% and 40% of child support amounts are either not paid, only partially paid or paid too late — placing at least 300,000 families in financial insecurity.

Single parents represent one out of four families in France, 85% of whom are mothers. A third are living under the poverty rate.

For these families, getting child support — on average 170 euros ($209) per month for each child — is key.

The measure also aims at preventing financial pressure and threats sometimes exerted by deadbeat parents.

Under the new system, any mother or father can request the new government service, regardless of whether the other parent disagrees. Once in place, the service handles the payment of the money until the child is 18.

The issue was raised in 2019 during the “grand debate” launched by Macron to allow the French to express their grievances following weeks of anti-government, yellow vest protests denouncing social injustice.

“I was struck by the number of women who told me they could not live decently because their alimony wasn’t paid,” Macron said at the time.

Many countries across Europe are facing similar problems.

In neighboring Belgium, deadbeat parents have been an issue to the point that the government has taken action by creating a special service which helps people in their legal quest to get the money owed and gives out advances if needed.

Last year, the Czech government proposed a program to guarantee payment of child support to single parents, which will become effective on July 1. The Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs estimated that the state will initially cover child support payments of up to 3,000 Czech koruna ($140) a month for about 24,000 children. The government will then claim the money from those who have failed to pay.

In Germany, around half of all child support payments by divorced parents are either not or not fully paid, according to estimates. In cases where the parents are too poor, the state pays child support until the children are 18 years old.

In Poland, a law of 2007 established a fund that pays up to 500 zlotys ($134) for children who aren't receiving due alimony. Before that, parents can seek a court order to try to get the money, but only around 13% of overdue or unpaid alimony is redeemed.

In many other countries, like Greece, Spain and Portugal, the main recourse is sought in the court, which often leads to lengthy delays and costly procedures before any decision is made.

WASHINGTON -- Officials have declared the U.S. Capitol complex ""secure"" after heavily armed police moved to end a nearly four-hour violent occupation by supporters of President Donald Trump.Violent protesters loyal to President Donald Trump stormed the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday and forced lawmakers into hiding, in a stunning attempt to overturn America's presidential election, undercut the nation's democracy and keep Democrat Joe Biden from replacing Trump in the White House.The National Guard and state and federal police were called in for control, and the mayor of Washington imposed a rare evening curfew. One person was reported to have been shot.The protesters were egged on for weeks by Trump, who since the November presidential election had launched a barrage of false attacks on the integrity of the results. While rallying his supporters outside the White House Wednesday morning, he urged them to march to the Capitol. But later - hours after they fought police and breached the building - he told them in a video that although they were ""very special people"" and he backed their cause, they should ""go home in peace.""Other than a pair of tweets and that minute-long video, Trump was largely disengaged from the occupation of a main seat of the nation's government. It was Vice President Mike Pence, not Trump, who spoke with senior defense leaders about calling up the National Guard.President-elect Biden, two weeks away from being inaugurated, had declared in Wilmington, Delaware: ""I call on President Trump to go on national television now to fulfill his oath and defend the Constitution and demand an end to this siege,""Biden said that democracy was ""under unprecedented assault,"" a sentiment echoed by many in Congress, including some Republicans.Even for a Capitol building that has seen centuries of protests and even violence - including a 1954 shooting involving Puerto Rican nationalists - Wednesday's events were astounding because they appeared to unfold at least initially with the blessing of the president and also because of the underlying goal of overturning the results of a lawful presidential election.The chaotic protests halted Congress' constitutionally mandated counting of the Electoral College results, in which Biden defeated Trump, 306-232. Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell had tried to steer Congress away from Wednesday's formal protest of those results, and he said at the start of proceedings that Trump had clearly lost.Wednesday's ordinarily mundane procedure of Congress certifying a new president was always going to be extraordinary, with Republican supporters of Trump vowing to protest election results that have been certified by the states. But even the unusual deliberations, which included Vice President Mike Pence and Senate Majority Leader McConnell defying Trump's demands, were quickly overtaken by the chaos.In a raucous, out-of-control scene, protesters fought past police and breached the building, shouting and waving Trump and American flags as they marched through the halls. One person was reported shot at the Capitol, according to a person familiar with the situation. That person's condition was unknown. At least one explosive device was found but law enforcement said it did not pose a threat.More than a dozen people were arrested.As darkness began to set in, law enforcement officials worked their way toward the protesters, using percussion grenades to try to clear the area around the Capitol. Big clouds of tear gas were visible. Police in full riot gear moved down the steps, clashing with demonstrators.It added up a frightening scene for lawmakers, who were directed to take extraordinary action for their own safety. The protesters abruptly interrupted the congressional proceedings in an eerie scene that featured official warnings directing people to duck under their seats for cover and put on gas masks after tear gas was used in the Capitol Rotunda. Some House lawmakers tweeted they were sheltering in place in their offices.Rep. Scott Peters, D-Calif., told reporters he was in the House chamber when protesters began storming it. Security officers ""made us all get down, you could see that they were fending off some sort of assault, it looked like. They had a piece of furniture up against the door, the door, the entry to the floor from the Rotunda, and they had guns pulled,"" Peters said.""And they just told us to take our pins off,"" he added, referring to lapel pins members wear so Capitol Police can quickly identify them. Then the lawmakers were evacuated.A clerk helped grabbed the boxes of Electoral College votes as the evacuation took place. Otherwis, said Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., the ballots likely would have been destroyed by the protesters.Trump supporters posting on internet forums popular with far-right fringe elements celebrated the chaos. Messages posted on one turned from profane frustration over the content of Trump's speech to glee when supporters stormed the building. At least one leading figure was livestreaming video from inside the Capitol during the siege.The Pentagon said about 1,100 District of Columbia National Guard members were being mobilized to help support law enforcement at the Capitol.Pence was closely watched as he stepped onto the dais to preside over the joint session in the House chamber.Pence had a largely ceremonial role, opening the sealed envelopes from the states after they are carried in mahogany boxes used for the occasion, and reading the results aloud. But he was under growing pressure from Trump to overturn the will of the voters and tip the results in the president's favor, despite having no legal power to affect the outcome.""Do it Mike, this is a time for extreme courage!"" Trump tweeted Wednesday.But Pence, in a statement shortly before presiding, defied Trump, saying he could not claim ""unilateral authority"" to reject the electoral votes that make Biden president.Despite Trump's repeated claims of voter fraud, election officials and his own former attorney general have said there were no problems on a scale that would change the outcome. All the states have certified their results as fair and accurate, by Republican and Democratic officials alike.Arizona was the first of several states facing objections from the Republicans as Congress took an alphabetical reading of the election results.

US Capitol secured after rioters stormed the halls of Congress to block Biden’s win,"National Politics

WATCH LIVE: Live video from the Capitol is streaming below.

WASHINGTON, D.C. (CNN)

(CNN) -- The US Capitol is once again secured after supporters of President Donald Trump breached one of the most iconic American buildings, engulfing the nation's capital in chaos after Trump urged his supporters to fight against the ceremonial counting of the electoral votes that will confirm President-elect Joe Biden's win.

Shortly after 1 p.m. ET Wednesday hundreds of pro-Trump protesters pushed through barriers set up along the perimeter of the Capitol, where they tussled with officers in full riot gear, some calling the officers ""traitors"" for doing their jobs. About 90 minutes later, police said demonstrators got into the building and the doors to the House and Senate were being locked. Shortly after, the House floor was evacuated by police. Vice President Mike Pence was also evacuated from Capitol, where he was to perform his role in the counting of electoral votes.

An armed standoff took place at the House front door as of 3 p.m. ET, and police officers had their guns drawn at someone who was trying to breach it. A Trump supporter was also pictured standing at the Senate dais earlier in the afternoon. A woman is in critical condition after being shot in the chest on the Capitol grounds, according to two sources familiar with the matter. The sources could not provide further details on the circumstances of the shooting. Multiple officers have been injured with at least one transported to the hospital, multiple sources tell CNN.

Smoke grenades were used on the Senate side of the Capitol, as police work to clear the building of rioters. Windows on the west side of the Senate have been broken, and hundreds of officers are amassing on the first floor of the building.

The Senate floor was cleared of rioters as of 3:30 p.m. ET, and an officer told CNN that they have successfully squeezed them away from the Senate wing of the building and towards the Rotunda, and they are removing them out of the East and West doors of the Capitol. It's not clear if any of the individuals have been taken into custody.

The US Capitol Police worked to secure the second floor of the Capitol first, and were seen just before 5 p.m. pushing demonstrators off the steps on the east side of the building. With about 30 minutes to go before Washington, DC's 6 p.m. ET curfew, Washington police amassed in a long line to push the mob back from the Capitol grounds.

It took until roughly 5:40 p.m. ET for the building to once again be secured, according to the sergeant-at-arms.

The stunning display of insurrection was the first time the US Capitol had been overrun since the British attacked and burned the building in August of 1814, during the War of 1812, according to Samuel Holliday, director of scholarship and operations with the US Capitol Historical Society.

An afternoon of chaos

The protesters first breached exterior security barriers, and video footage showed protesters gathering and some clashing with police near the Capitol building. CNN's team on the ground saw a number of protesters trying to move up the side of the Capitol building. Several loud flash bangs were heard as well.

Protesters could be seen pushing against metal fences and police using the fences to push protesters back, while other officers reached over the top to club people trying to cross their lines.

Flash bangs could be heard near the steps of the Capitol as smoke filled the air. In some instances officers could be seen deploying pepper spray. Tear gas was deployed, but it's not clear whether by protesters or police, and people wiped tears from their eyes while coughing.

After the building was breached, the Capitol police officer in the House chamber told lawmakers that they may need to duck under their chairs and informed lawmakers that protesters were in the building's Rotunda. Lots of House members were seen wearing gas masks as they move between Capitol buildings. Members were calling family to say they are OK.

There are no clear answers yet on when the joint session will continue, multiple sources familiar told CNN. Congressional leadership wants the situation to be brought under control first.

Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, a New York Democrat who is a member of leadership, told reporters: ""The Capitol is being cleared. When it is safe, we will return to complete our constitutional responsibilities. This is the United States. We will not allow mob rule to undermine the rule of law.""

Congressional leaders were being evacuated from the Capitol complex just before 5 p.m. ET and were set to be taken to Fort McNair, a nearby Army base in Washington, according to a federal law enforcement official.

Trump has directed the National Guard to Washington along with ""other federal protective services,"" according to White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany. The entire DC National Guard has been activated by the Department of Defense, according to the Pentagon.

""The D.C. Guard has been mobilized to provide support to federal law enforcement in the District,"" said Jonathan Hoffman, the chief Pentagon spokesman. ""Acting Secretary Miller has been in contact with Congressional leadership, and Secretary McCarthy has been working with the D.C. government. The law enforcement response will be led by the Department of Justice.""

The official said DC National Guard was not anticipating to be used to protect federal facilities, and the Trump administration had decided earlier this week that would be the task of civilian law enforcement, the official said.

Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser just announced a citywide curfew from 6 p.m. ET on Wednesday until 6 a.m. ET Thursday.

The shocking scene was met with less police force than many of the Black Lives Matter protests that rolled across the country in the wake of George Floyd's killing at the hands of Minneapolis police officers last year. While federal police attacked peaceful protesters in Lafayette Square outside the White House over the summer, clearing the way for Trump to take a photo in front of a nearby church at the time, protesters on Wednesday were able to overrun Capitol police and infiltrate the country's legislative chambers.

Trump tells supporters to go home, eventually

Trump finally called on his supporters to ""go home"" hours after the riot started, but spent a large amount of time in the one-minute video lamenting and lying about his election loss.

In one stunning line, Trump told the mob to ""go home,"" but added, ""We love you. You are very special.""

Trump struck a sympathetic tone to the rioters he himself unleashed saying, ""I know your pain, I know you're hurt. We had an election that was stolen from us. It was a landslide election and everyone knows it. Especially the other side. But you have to go home now. We have to have peace.""

Others inside the President's orbit tweeted their calls for calm as the mob repeatedly attempted to take over the building.

Donald Trump Jr., the President's son, said that his supporters who mobbed the Capitol were ""wrong and not who we are.""

""Be peaceful and use your 1st Amendment rights, but don't start acting like the other side. We have a country to save and this doesn't help anyone,"" he tweeted.

Multiple bombs detonated safely

Federal and local law enforcement responded to reports of possible pipe bombs in multiple locations in Washington, DC, according to a federal law enforcement official. It's unclear if the devices are real or a hoax, but they're being treated as real.

A pipe bomb was found at the Republican National Committee's headquarters earlier Wednesday, an RNC official told CNN. The device was found on the ground outside, along the wall of the headquarters. It was safely detonated by the police, the RNC official said.

At least two suspected pipe bombs have been rendered safe by law enforcement, including the one at the building that houses RNC offices and one in the US Capitol complex, a federal law enforcement official told CNN. The official said these were real explosive devices and they were detonated safely.

The Democratic National Committee was also evacuated after a suspicious package was being investigated nearby, a Democratic source familiar with the matter told CNN. The party had preemptively closed the building ahead of the protests, the source said, but a few security and essential personnel were evacuated.

"Trump supporters protest at Minnesota Capitol, move toward governor’s mansion","Up to 500 supporters of President Donald Trump protested outside Minnesota's fenced-off State Capitol on Wednesday as chaos continued in Washington D.C., and soon planned to make their way toward Gov. Tim Walz's residence.

Minnesota state troopers guarded entrances to buildings on the Capitol complex, but the opening hour of the demonstration was heavy on speeches and chants in opposition to both the outcome of the presidential election and emergency measures implemented in Minnesota to stop the spread of COVID-19.

By the time a handful of protesters made it to the Summit Avenue residence, a line of State Troopers in riot helmets stood behind a fence guarding the home.

""Recall Walz!"" the group repeatedly chanted.

""Just like the Nazis in Germany, you wear brown shirts,"" one man wearing a backward camouflage Trump baseball cap yelled at the troopers. ""I hope you know that you've taken an oath to uphold the constitution and that you do not belong, you are not his personal bully squad!""

Before setting off for the governor's residence, speakers at the top of the hill ratcheted up rhetoric to urge charges of treason against those who stood in Trump's way.

Alley Waterbury, a Woodbury activist who served as emcee, led prayers and chants of ""four more years,"" saying afterward that ""we want Trump in there.""

Waterbury was indicted on a charge of lying to an FBI agent, she said, an experience she said later drew her to follow Trump.

Waterbury laughed as she told the crowd that House Republicans in D.C. were ordered to take cover. The news was met with cheers.

The relative calm in St. Paul was in contrast to clashes in Washington, D.C., between pro-Trump supporters and law enforcement that unfolded as the congressional process got underway. In Washington, Trump supporters breached security at the U.S. Capitol, forcing House and Senate recesses not long after the certification debate got underway.

In St. Paul, protesters hoisted Trump flags and homemade signs that bellowed ""Stop The Steal"" and ""Do Not Certify."" Others walked around with recordings of past Trump speeches playing on their phones, at times hooking them up to speakers. At least one protester waved a large flag in support of the III% militia movement.

Waterbury returned her focus to Walz urging him to talk to her about his restrictions.

""If you don't open our state back up we will do whatever we need to do because we've got nothing left to lose.""

She said inaction would also ""make us do things we don't want to do""

Another speaker described the current state of play: ""This is 1776 … the time for talk is over. It's done. My brothers and sisters in Washington are doing it right now. … Be on the right side of history because we are about to make it. … lets pray our elected officials have a change of heart in the last second or we are going to change it for them.""

A state court judge who approved Minnesota Secretary of State Steve Simon's agreement to waive witness requirements and extend the deadline for counting mail ballots was singled out for ire. State Reps. Eric Lucero, R-Dayton, and Steve Drazkowski, R-Mazeppa, stoking chants against the judge, who was appointed by ex-DFL Gov. Mark Dayton and was a staffer for Democratic U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar.

Lucero, a plaintiff in a lawsuit that drew a favorable ruling from the Eighth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, said he was considering drafting articles of impeachment against the judge.

A newly formed group called Hold The Line organized the event. Becky Strohmeier, of Bloomington, started the group a day after Election Day last year, she said.

""We just have a lot of patriots,"" she said. ""I've never met two of them who were exactly the same.""

She added: ""We're not just going to let our election get stolen by blatant fraud and cheating,""

About 20 people in the crowd of roughly 500 were clad in camouflage and openly carried rifles, pistols and other firearms. They were there as part of the state chapter the Three Percenters Original.

The state leader of the group, an Iron Range man who identified himself only as Matt, said the group followed Trump's call to assemble on Wednesday to protest election fraud.

Matt said his group would not take action if Biden was confirmed as president, however, adding ""the president is the president no matter who that is. … We don't care who is president as long as the president abides by the constitution.""

Matt said his group believes constitutional rights are ""systematically being stripped away"" but he does not believe the nation is at a line at which force is needed.

""I think that's something that will have to be done in my lifetime to try to preserve what our Founding Fathers envisioned … but there is no line drawn. I can't say what that is at this point, hopefully that will never have to be done; hopefully we just get people in office who want to follow the Constitution.""

Matt disagreed with any labeling of his group as a militia, calling it a misconception. He also sought to distance it from the Boogaloo movement. On Wednesday, a smaller group of attendees wore the Hawaiian shirts and military-style garb popular with that movement.

""We're here because the president who we support has called patriots to the Capitol,"" he said. ""We're here to follow suit in our own state.""

""We need to stay on our game,"" Waterbury said.

Waterbury later called on the crowd to continue mobilizing each weekend to drive to lawmakers and other public officials' homes to protest.

""This should be what should be here every flipping Saturday until we get our state back,"" Waterbury told the crowd. She said some people have called her Facebook posts conspiracy theories and said she has been scaring people.

""Are you frickin' scared?"" Waterbury asked. ""No!""

""Are you going to fight back?"" she yelled. ""No!""

Legalized Marijuana in New York: This Could Be the Year,"Indeed, New York State leaders kicked off the new legislative session on Wednesday with a singular, once-in-a-generation challenge: how to rescue a state in a pandemic-driven crisis.

Tax revenues have dried up, leading to an estimated shortfall of nearly $63 billion over the next four years. The fiscal straits have given new wind to measures that could raise revenue, like increasing taxes on the rich, allowing mobile sports betting and legalizing marijuana.

This year will also see Democrats enjoy a supermajority in both chambers, after the party expanded its majority in the State Senate in November, giving legislators the option of aggressively pursuing left-wing measures without fear of a veto from Mr. Cuomo, a centrist Democrat.

Here is a look at some key themes for the legislative session, which runs through mid-June.

The head of the National Association of Manufacturers, a group representing 14,000 companies in the U.S., on Wednesday said clashes in Washington that interrupted a congressional gathering to certify Electoral College results of the 2020 presidential election were ""not the vision of America that manufacturers believe in"" and called on Vice President Mike Pence to ""seriously consider"" invoking the 25th Amendment of the Constitution to remove President Donald Trump from office.

The statement came as the Business Roundtable and leaders such as Citi CEO Michael Corbat and Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff condemned the acts.

Jay Timmons, the group's president and CEO and a former executive director of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, pointed to the millions of people in manufacturing jobs who are working to fight the coronavirus pandemic, which brought on an economic recession.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The crowd pushed past the police barricades, up the steps to the iron doors and in what seemed like no time at all, hoisted a Trump flag from the U.S. Capitol.

“Protesters are in the building,” came the last words picked up by a microphone carrying a live feed of the Senate before it shut off.

Hundreds of President Donald Trump’s supporters paraded and hollered through some of the most hallowed spaces in the Capitol -- propped at the Senate dais and in the House speaker’s office -- all to protest the election and keep President Donald Trump in office.

It was an extraordinary, unprecedented scene.

Trump, the defeated president, had been encouraging protesters as Congress convened for a joint session to certify Joe Biden’s win.

Under the very risers set up for Biden’s inauguration at the U.S. Capitol, the Trump supporters gathered.

Protests are typical at the Capitol. But this one was not.

At least one person was shot and killed, though it’s not clear who pulled the trigger during the chaotic scene. Some in the crowd were shouting “traitors” as officers tried to keep them back.

Inside the House chamber, lawmakers described a harrowing scene.

As they stayed down, they were told to have gas masks at the ready -- and take off the lapel pins they wear identifying them as elected representatives.

Police had guns drawn, and furniture barricaded the door.

Glass was shattered. Some prayed while protesters banged on the doors. Rep. Dean Phillips yelled loudly at his Republicans, “This is because of you!”

A chaplain prayed as police guarded the doors to the chamber and lawmakers tried to gather information about what was happening.

Announcements blared: Due to an “external security threat,” no one could enter or exit the Capitol complex, the recording said. Lawmakers tweeted that they were sheltering in place.

Reporters and lawmakers hid under tables as the protesters banged on the door, demanding to be let inside. Rumors of guns spread but it wasn’t clear if any shots were fired beside the one. Tear gas was said to have been dispersed in the Rotunda.

After making sure the hallways were clear, police swiftly escorted people down a series of hallways and tunnels to a cafeteria in one of the House office buildings.

As he walked out of the Capitol, Connecticut Rep. Jim Himes said he “always assumed it could never happen here.”

But others were not so sure.

Rep. Mike Kelly of Pennsylvania, among those challenging Biden’s win, blamed “both sides” for the chaos at the Capitol.

“What do you think was taking place in this country?” he told reporters. “There’s been a lot of people during the last four years that have just been getting more and more incensed over what is going on around the country, on both sides. It’s just too bad. This is not how we handle things in America.”

The Senate side was not much different.

Vice President Mike Pence, who was presiding over the session, was evacuated from the Senate as protesters and police shouted outside the doors.

Police evacuated the chamber at 2:30 p.m., ushering senators to the first of what would be several undisclosed locations.

Clerks grabbed boxes of electoral college certificates as they left.

Vice President-elect Kamala Harris, attending the session, was among those ushered to safety.

As soon as they left, protesters roamed the halls shouting, “Where are they?” One got on the Senate dais and yelled, “Trump won that election.”","['Lisa Mascaro', 'Ben Fox', 'Ashraf Khalil', 'Michael Balsamo']",https://news.google.com,high
California Gov. Newsom proposes new $600 stimulus checks,"Washington (CNN) California Gov. Gavin Newsom is calling for the state to send new $600 stimulus payments to low-income residents.

The cash would add to the $600 in federal stimulus payments that Congress approved last month that will go to roughly 4 million Californians, according to the governor's office.

Unlike the federal money, undocumented immigrants would be eligible for the California payments.

Newsom's proposal is part of a broader economic relief plan that includes an extension of the state's eviction moratorium, which is set to expire on January 31. If it's extended, renters facing financial hardship due to the pandemic would be protected from eviction as long as they have paid at least 25% of their unpaid rent.

The Democratic governor's plan also calls for using the state's $2.6 billion in federal stimulus money to help stabilize both low-income renters and small business owners.

'It wasn't a race-related issue': Attorney of woman who falsely accused Black teen of phone theft speaks out,"The attorney of the woman who tackled and falsely accused the 14-year-old son of jazz musician Keyon Harrold of stealing her iPhone that she left in an Uber said Tuesday that the incident “wasn’t a race-related issue.”

In a phone call, attorney Sharon Ghatan, who is representing 22-year-old Miya Ponsetto in an unrelated case, confirmed her client was the woman who lunged at and tackled Keyon Harrold Jr. in the lobby at the Arlo SoHo, an upscale boutique hotel in New York City. Harrold, who is Black, has suggested that racial bias played a role in the Dec. 26 incident.

“Things took a life of their own,” Ghatan said. “Miya is young, she let her emotions get the best of her. That phone could have been in hand of 90-year-old grandma, an Asian person... someone Black or blue.""

Ghatan said Ponsetto, who lives with her single mother in California, was in the city visiting her father when she lost her phone. She did not know anyone in the city and was in an “emotional, anxious state"" and ""made a mistake” when she falsely accused Harrold’s son of theft, according to Ghatan.

The attorney said that had the Uber driver returned her phone 15 minutes earlier, the altercation would not have happened.

Ponsetto, of Puerto Rican descent, was in a “very fragile” state, Ghatan said. “She lost her mind for a hot minute. She is sorry… Sadly these poor Harrolds had to deal with the aftermath.”

Ghatan added that her client wanted to “move forward and put this behind her.” She nor her client have been contacted by law enforcement officials or civil rights lawyer Ben Crump, who represents the Harrold family, Ghatan said.

Ponsetto was charged with public intoxication and battery for a Beverly Hills hotel incident on Feb. 28, according to court documents. She was also arrested on May 28 for driving under the influence in Van Nuys, California, court documents show.

A hearing for the charges related to the Beverly Hills incident was scheduled for later this month, Ghatan said. In September, a judge at the Van Nuys Courthouse West sentenced Ponsetto to 3 years of summary probation after she pleaded no contest for driving under the influence.

Ponsetto was thrown into the national spotlight when Harrold posted a minute-long video of the altercation on Instagram late last year — sparking outrage from social media users who accused Ponsetto of racially discriminating against Harrold and his son.

Ponsetto can be heard accosting Harrold and his son, yelling, “Show me my phone!” A man in the video who identified himself as the hotel manager can also be heard asking to see Harrold Jr.’s phone.

Before the video cuts out, Ponsetto can be seen approaching Harrold, prompting the jazz musician to shout: “Get your hands off!”

A 10-second video from the hotel’s security footage captured Ponsetto rushing at and encircling her arms around Harrold’s son.

Police in New York City said Harrold “sustained scratches to his hand.” No other injuries were reported.

More than 100,000 people signed an online petition posted by Crump, who called for Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. to bring assault and battery charges against Ponsetto.

“Keyon Harrold Jr. will live with this trauma for life, the weight of racism on the shoulders of another generation,” Crump wrote in a statement. “He deserves better than this treatment!”

A spokesperson for the Manhattan DA told NBC News last Monday that the office was ""thoroughly investigating this incident.""

At a press conference last Wednesday, Harrold, accompanied by Crump and Rev. Al Sharpton, spoke publicly about the incident.

“I can’t even come downstairs in New York City — prime New York City — and just go brunch without being attacked and wrongfully accused of something,” Harrold said. “The idea of trauma goes above any charge that could ever be had.”

“I want my son to grow up whole,” Harrold said.

In an interview with “Good Morning America” last Tuesday, Harrold Jr. said he was “confused” and “shell-shocked” over the incident. ""I would ask her why would she do something like this to a kid who has never met you at all and I would just ask just why,"" he said.","['Wilson Wong', 'Wilson Wong Is A Breaking News Reporter With Nbc News.', 'Diana Dasrath', 'Diana Dasrath Is Entertainment Producer', 'Senior Reporter For Nbc News Covering All Platforms.']",https://news.google.com,high

Biden’s tax plan has a better chance as Democrats sweep Georgia,"Democratic U.S. Senate candidates Jon Ossoff (R) and Raphael Warnock (L) of Georgia wave to supporters during a rally on November 15, 2020 in Marietta, Georgia. Jessica McGowan | Getty Images

Democrats will now have a narrow lead in the Senate, which may give President-elect Joe Biden's tax plan a better chance at passing. Georgia hosted two hotly contested Senate runoff races on Tuesday. Democrat Rev. Raphael Warnock won the race against incumbent Republican Sen. Kelly Loeffler, according to NBC News projections and Democrat Jon Ossoff has also won his contest against Republican David Perdue, NBC News projects.

Two wins in Georgia give Democrats a 50-50 split for control over the Senate, with Vice President-elect Kamala Harris as the tiebreaker. This also means that Biden's plan – a proposal that calls for higher taxes on households with more than $400,000 in income – could be a step closer to fruition. Don't overhaul your own plans just yet, though. ""2020 has taught us that the danger of predicting is high, so we always try to plan and not predict,"" said Pam Lucina, chief fiduciary officer and head of the trust and advisory practice at Northern Trust Wealth Management. ""The mantra is what we've always said, 'Don't make changes based on political predictions,'"" she said. ""Your long-term goals are to always be a guide.""

Reviewing key proposal elements

Here's a recap of the some of the major elements Biden pitched during his campaign. Increasing the top individual income tax rate to 39.6%: The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act set a top marginal individual income tax rate of 37%. Extending the 12.4% portion of the Social Security tax to earnings over $400,000. Under current law, wages up to $137,700 are subject to this tax. Raising the capital gains rate to 39.6% for taxpayers with more than $1 million in income. Right now, wealthy investors are subject to a top rate of 20% on long-term capital gains.

This isn't 2017 – this is different. There's a 50-50 tie at best, and every Democratic Senator has veto power over the bill. Tony Nitti, CPA partner in RubinBrown's Tax Services Group

Eliminating the step-up in basis. Today, heirs receive assets valued as of the date of death, which means they can sell these investments with little to no tax. Biden's proposal would tax unrealized capital gains. Lowering the amount wealthy families can transfer free of the estate and gift tax. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act allows individuals to transfer up to $11.7 million without facing the gift or estate tax. Biden's proposal calls for lowering this limit to $3.5 million per individual in bequeaths and $1 million in gifts. Raising corporate tax rates. The corporate tax rate is currently 21%, but Biden's proposal calls for increasing it to 28%. At this point, tax professionals are grappling with queries from their clients. ""How likely are these things to happen? How soon might they happen? How high will taxes go?"" asked John Gimigliano, principal-in-charge, federal tax legislative and regulatory services at KPMG.

Greenlighting a tax overhaul still unlikely

An even split in the Senate gives Biden's proposals more of a chance, but it doesn't guarantee the initiatives will move forward. ""This isn't 2017 – this is different,"" said Tony Nitti, CPA and partner in RubinBrown's Tax Services Group, recalling how Republicans had control of the Senate that year and were able to push forward the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. ""There's a 50-50 tie at best, and every Democratic Senator has veto power over the bill,"" he said, noting moderate Democrats like Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., might be less likely to go along with a tax increase in a pandemic.

""Couple that with a thinner majority in the House and set it against the backdrop of the global pandemic, and it's really hard to envision a scenario where sweeping changes get done in that environment,"" said Nitti. Lawmakers may also prioritize additional Covid-relief measures before they begin to tackle sweeping changes to the tax code. ""We're focusing on a very serious pandemic right now,"" said Lucina of Northern Trust. ""All of the facts that are there don't point toward aggressive changes."" Indeed, Biden has said that he'd push for another round of stimulus payments in the next aid bill.

"Warnock wins Georgia runoff, CNN projects, as control of Senate comes down to Perdue-Ossoff race","(CNN) The Rev. Raphael Warnock , the senior pastor of Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, will be the first Black senator from Georgia, CNN projected early Wednesday, a repudiation of Republican Sen. Kelly Loeffler and her adherence to President Donald Trump.

The Democratic Party appears closer to retaking the US Senate, as Georgia Republican David Perdue narrowly trails in his fight to keep his seat against Democratic candidate Jon Ossoff. Both candidates claimed they would win after all the ballots had been counted, but CNN has not yet called the race.

Warnock is the first Georgia Democrat elected to the Senate in 20 years, and his election is the culmination of years of voter registration drives conducted by former state House Democratic leader Stacey Abrams and other activists. President-elect Joe Biden also won Georgia, the first time for a Democratic presidential candidate since the 1990s.

""I am an iteration and an example of the American dream,"" the senator-elect told CNN's John Berman Wednesday morning on ""New Day."" He added, ""When I think about the arc of our history, what Georgia did last night is its own message in the midst of a moment in which so many people are trying to divide our country, at a time we can least afford to be divided.""

After no Georgia Senate candidate received 50% of the vote in November, the races turned to two runoffs. While Ossoff and Warnock ran on a unity ticket, Trump refused to concede his own loss, sparking a fight within the Republican Party and disenchanting some of his supporters, who believed his false claims that the vote was rigged.

Trump's ongoing onslaught against the Republican officials in charge of the elections pressured the two GOP senators to make a choice: Join the President in seeking to overturn the democratic outcome or risk losing Trump supporters, some of whom have become disenchanted with the electoral process. Trump recently appeared to pressure Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger on a private call, urging him to ""find"" enough votes to reverse the results. Raffensperger refused.

But despite three recounts and no evidence of widespread fraud, Loeffler and Perdue decided to join the President in objecting to Congress' certification of the Electoral College's results in a final, deluded display of devotion to Trump supporters.

""The American people deserve a platform in Congress, permitted under the Constitution, to have election issues presented so that they can be addressed,"" said Loeffler in a statement on Monday.

Asked if it was appropriate for her to vote against certification of the electoral votes, Warnock told CNN Wednesday that his opponent ""has consistently put what she perceives to be her own short-term political interests over the concerns of ordinary people.""

""What is unfolding in the Senate today or in the House, what's unfolding in this moment is a distraction. It's a distraction,"" he told Berman. ""These senators know better and the people that I'm talking to all across Georgia are concerned about their lives.""

While Georgia is a rapidly diversifying state, the Republican candidates came into the Senate runoff elections with an advantage.

In November, Perdue received over 88,000 more votes than Ossoff, while Loeffler and the other Republican candidates received more votes than Warnock and the other Democratic candidates in the special election (Warnock received most of the vote -- 33% -- overall).

Republicans hoped their message that Georgia should be a check on Washington would prove successful, noting that if Warnock and Ossoff win, Biden, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer will be in charge.

""We're talking about the future of the country, and we can't just turn it all over to one party,"" said Eric Tanenblatt, who served as chief of staff to former Republican Georgia Gov. Sonny Perdue, before Election Day. ""That could be wishful thinking on my part. But I do think that that's going to be a big motivator.""

But Republicans are worried that Trump's unwillingness to concede jeopardizes the party's hold on the Senate, even though the state has not elected a Democrat to the chamber since 2000.

Heath Garrett, a campaign manager for former Georgia Republican Sen. Johnny Isakson, told CNN that Trump's attacks on Gov. Brian Kemp and Raffensperger were ""counterproductive for trying to motivate grassroots, base Republicans to go vote,"" and said they've threw Perdue and Loeffler ""off message"" in the final days of the campaign.

""Senator Perdue and Senator Loeffler are being whipsawed by the President on one side and by the Democratic money on the other side,"" he said.

Perdue and Loeffler had attempted to avoid the intraparty feud sparked by Trump by focusing on Ossoff and Warnock.

Perdue's closing message in a recent video was littered with attacks, saying that if Republicans lose, undocumented immigrants will vote, Americans' private health insurance will be ""taken away,"" and Democrats will pack the Supreme Court and defund the police.

""We win Georgia, we save America,"" Perdue told the camera.

The Democratic candidates counter that they would ""demilitarize"" rather than defund the police, create a legal pathway for undocumented immigrants and support a public option to decrease the number of uninsured. Neither Democratic candidate has advocated adding justices to the court.

They argued they would do a better job ending the health care crisis over the coronavirus, which has infected more than 20.8 million Americans and killed at least 354,000, in order to reopen the economy. They've pushed policy goals, including debt-free public college and a new Voting Rights Act. And they've attacked the Republican senators for their multi-million dollar stock transactions during the pandemic, alleging that they profited off it. The senators have denied any wrongdoing.

Warnock told CNN Wednesday that he believes tackling the pandemic by effectively distributing the vaccine and passing $2,000 stimulus checks should be the new Senate's top priority.

The special election was particularly brutal, starting last year when GOP Rep. Doug Collins forced Loeffler, who Kemp appointed to the role in 2019, into a race to the right.

After no candidate received 50% of the vote, the runoffs turned even more vicious, as Loeffler portrayed Warnock an anti-police Marxist who would destroy America in the Senate.

""We have to have Georgians come out and vote because we know that Chuck Schumer's radical agents of change are Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff,"" said Loeffler on the campaign trail Monday. ""They would defund the police. They would lock down our economy. And we have to make sure that we hold the line right here in Georgia.""

Warnock has in turn promoted his background from the Savannah projects to the pulpit of Martin Luther King Jr.'s historic church, while firing back at Loeffler.

""Kelly Loeffler spends tens of millions of dollars to scare you,"" said Warnock in an ad. ""She's trying to make you afraid of me because she's afraid of you. Afraid that you understand how she's used her position in the Senate to enrich herself and others like her. Afraid that you'll realize that we can do better.""

Perdue, a 71-year-old former Fortune 500 CEO, has dismissed Ossoff, a 33-year-old media executive, saying the Democrat does not know how to create a job. At their debate in the fall, Ossoff called the senator a ""crook"" who was ""fending off multiple federal investigations for insider trading"" while attacking ""the health of the people"" who he represents. Perdue snapped back that the Democrat had worked for ""the mouthpiece of terrorism and Communist China"" -- claims Ossoff called ""ridiculous.""

The Georgia US Senate races have attracted enormous attention due to the stakes for the first years of the Biden administration and the state's shift from red to purple. Dr. Charles Bullock, a University of Georgia political science professor, told CNN that the Senate elections could be the first in which urban Georgia casts more votes than rural Georgia.

""We've seen tremendous enthusiasm in the early voting numbers, both in person and by mail, and we know that while Democrats will have a lead when polls open ... Republicans are expected to have a strong Election Day,"" said Seth Bringman, a spokesman for Fair Fight Action, a voting rights organization founded by Abrams.

Political groups spent about $520 million to advertise in the two runoff races, according to Kantar Media/CMAG, averaging more than $8 million per day. Republicans outspent Democrats by tens of millions of dollars.

With the Senate on the line, Trump rallied his supporters in northwest Georgia on Monday, while President-elect Joe Biden held an event in Atlanta.

Biden said electing Ossoff and Warnock would end the gridlock in Washington and allow Congress to provide $2,000 stimulus checks to Americans. Trump urged the state to elect Perdue and Loeffler, and claimed that Biden would not take the White House.

""We're going to fight like hell,"" said the President.

COVID-19 vaccine doses have been delivered but are sitting on pharmacy shelves. Longer delays could prolong the pandemic,"COVID-19 vaccine doses have been delivered but are sitting on pharmacy shelves. Longer delays could prolong the pandemic

Karen Weintraub | USA TODAY

Show Caption Hide Caption How the new RNA technology is used to create the COVID-19 vaccines The COVID-19 vaccine is using new technology that has never been used before in traditional vaccines. Here's how an mRNA vaccine works. Just the FAQs, USA TODAY

If the pace of COVID-19 vaccine delivery into people's arms stays the way it has been for the past few weeks, it could take years rather than months to vaccinate Americans, and the outbreak will continue to dominate lives.

Federal officials overestimated the speed at which vaccines could be given, making delivery a disappointment in an otherwise successful vaccine development effort.

Doses have been distributed behind the government's initial schedule – 15 million, instead of the 20 million doses promised to be delivered by the end of 2020. About 70% of those doses are sitting on pharmacy shelves, according to government data, and only about 14% of doses destined for nursing home residents and caregivers have been injected.

Although vaccination is off to a rough start, it's not too late to turn the situation around, according to experts such as Kelly Moore, deputy director of the Immunization Action Coalition, an education and advocacy group.

To do so will require a host of improvements, including more money, additional staffing and greater experience with vaccines that have been shown to be safe and effective but not so easy to use.

About 200,000 doses are being given a day. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said vaccinators should soon be able to deliver 1 million a day.

""There were a lot of aspirational goals set by federal officials about how many vaccines could be delivered how quickly,"" Moore said. ""The delivery of a box of vaccine to a clinic door is the easiest part of the process.""

'Bizarre, disorganized': Wisconsin behind most of Midwest on COVID-19 vaccinations; some health care workers say they're in the dark

Chicago has delivered 95% of the vaccine it's received, but at the current rate of delivery, it would take a year to a year-and-a-half to vaccinate the city's residents, Mayor Lori Lightfoot said Tuesday.

""That is unacceptable,” she said. “The federal government must absolutely, 100% step up.”

Chicago has built infrastructure to deliver the vaccine, Lightfoot said, but needs more doses. “The federal government has to step up, finally, and do a better job at protecting American lives from this terrible virus.”

Operation Warp Speed, the federal program tasked with developing and delivering COVID-19 vaccines, promised to vaccinate 20 million Americans in December.

Three weeks after shipping began, the program has distributed 15 million doses to hospitals and nursing home providers, but only 4.5 million people have gotten the first of the two-shot regimen. That means 30% of available doses have been used.

Among nursing home residents and caregivers, 365,000 shots have been delivered out of more than 2.5 million distributed – a 14% usage rate.

The numbers may be somewhat better than they appear because of a lag in reporting, but there's no question that fewer shots are being given than was planned or expected.

Federal officials have focused on getting the vaccine onto hospital shelves, but to get them off the shelves requires ""an enormous human element,"" Moore said.

There are always bugs when you ""translate from paper to practice,"" she said, and federal plans didn't give enough consideration to the need for scheduling and organizing clinics, educating patients and caregivers and resolving the small problems that crop up.

Hospital workers and public health officials are exhausted after 11 months of fighting the virus.

""And now they're being asked to ramp up the most ambitious vaccine program the country has ever seen,"" said Dr. Howard Koh, a former assistant secretary for health at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and now a professor at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.

The protocols for this vaccine are different from those for the seasonal flu vaccine, for which a nurse can wheel a cart through hospital hallways, delivering shot after shot.

People who receive a COVID-19 vaccine have to be watched for 15 minutes to ensure they don't have an allergic reaction. This requires hospitals to set aside space and personnel – both of which are at a premium.

The process is further slowed as caregivers have to think about who should or shouldn't be vaccinated.

""All of those things are just part of the not-unexpected challenges we face in implementing such a complex program with a new vaccine based on a new platform in the midst of the height of the pandemic with exhausted health care workers who are at the end of their rope after all the work they've been doing for the past year,"" Moore said.

By the time there is enough vaccine to distribute outside hospitals and other care facilities to the broader community, vaccinators will have worked out some of the kinks in the system, she said.

It may get easier to vaccinate large numbers of people when shots can be delivered at neighborhood pharmacies and health care facilities.

CVS is ready to deliver vaccine at all 10,000 of its pharmacies nationwide and expects to be able to give 20 million to 25 million doses a month once enough vaccine is available.

""We're ready to go once the government authorizes wider distribution,"" said Mike DeAngelis, a CVS spokesperson.

Frustrating front-line experience

Dr. Steven Wolf said his experience last weekend illustrates many of the challenges facing vaccinators.

Wolf, who co-runs neurology services for YAI, a New York-based support organization for people with autism, Down syndrome and other conditions, came in over his vacation to vaccinate patients and the staff members who care for them.

""I was envisioning that we were going to get them in and out fast,"" Wolf said, but the process was ""horribly terrible.""

It took 52 clicks on each person's digital medical record before the patient was ready to receive a shot. That was after YAI had managed to get consent forms signed by family members and guardians for those who couldn't sign for themselves.

""It was just freaking endless,"" Wolf said of the paperwork.

He and two others were able to vaccinate 40 people in three hours, far fewer than he anticipated.

Ten caregivers refused to receive the vaccine. Some wanted to talk it over with family members. Others wanted more people to go first, while some repeated conspiracy theories about the vaccine.

Wolf said he considers himself a pretty persuasive person, and he was armed with lots of facts about the minor side effects and major benefits of the vaccine, but he said he and his colleagues couldn't persuade those 10 to get vaccinated.

""We talk people into medication and surgery and all these other things, and we could not convince these 10 that this is what you've got to do to take care of yourself,"" he said. ""I came home so frustrated.""

Polls: Show increasing trust in COVID-19 vaccine after months of decline

Lack of money, focus and leadership

Although Congress allocated $8 billion for vaccine distribution, Koh, the former federal health official, said it's not enough and should have arrived months ago.

""This is a field that has been under-resourced and overlooked for far too long,"" Koh said.

Koh, who was commissioner of public health for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts during 9/11 and the anthrax scare in 2001, said officials promised then never to be caught off guard again by a public health emergency, but that resolve didn't last.

He criticized the lack of federal leadership and politicization of public health, saying state and local governments should collaborate, not go it alone.

""A crisis like this should be bipartisan, nonpartisan, one government response,"" he said, but that's not what's happened.

Moore lives in Tennessee, which has eight neighboring states each with different policies. In Bristol, Tennessee, police officers have to wait until health care workers are vaccinated, while officers across the border in Bristol, Virginia, are allowed to line up.

Different standards could mean vaccinators will hesitate to make sure they're not making a mistake, and recipients will be more likely to pass on the vaccine, thinking they're not a priority.

There's no right way to prioritize who should get the vaccine first, second and third, Moore said, but having each state choose its own path is too confusing. ""The right way to do this is to pick one way,"" she said.

These problems are all solvable, Moore said, and it's realistic to think they will be fixed within the next month, and the number of vaccinations will reach 1 million a day nationwide, as Fauci suggested.

Surgeon General Jerome Adams, speaking on NBC News’ ""Today"" show, agreed that the state delivery systems have been uneven, some distributing 75% or more of available doses and others not even 25%.

He said there would be more money to help out, more locations will soon be added to provide vaccinations and more people will be eligible to get the vaccine. “Your headline today really should be ‘Surgeon General tells states and governors to move quickly to other priority groups,’” he said.

The bottom line is that everyone wants vaccinations to move faster, said Nancy Foster, vice president for quality and patient safety policy at the American Hospital Association. Vaccines provide the chance to get beyond COVID-19 as a force in our lives.

""It is the great opportunity and the great hope,"" Foster said. ""No one wants to see it moving slowly.""

"US STOCKS-Dow, S&P 500 hit fresh all-time peaks, but pro-Trump protests curb gains","TipRanks

There’s a strong feeling growing among investors – of relief – that the new year will feature lower volatility than 2020. That along would be enough to boost spirits, but better yet, there is also a perception that the markets are going to drive higher in the new year.Marko Kolanovic, JPMorgan’s well-known quant expert, sees the initial stages of a positive feedback loop, with lower volatility and systematic investment strategies coming together to drive gains, attracting more investors – and, in Kolanovic’s view, pushing the S&P 500 to 4,600 by year’s end. That will be a 25% increase for the index.A general market environment like that is bound to produce plenty of stock winners, and Wall Street’s analysts are busy pointing them out. Among other things, they are tapping penny stocks, equities priced at less than $5 per share. Their rock-bottom starting price makes pennies the logical place to look for huge returns on investment. Although their risk factor is high, even a small gain in absolute numbers will turn into a massive percentage gain in share price.Using TipRanks’ database, we identified two penny stocks the pros believe could see explosive gains in the coming months. Not to mention each one gets a “Strong Buy” consensus rating from the analyst community.9 Meters Biopharma (NMTR)Some biopharma companies take a broad-based approach, while others focus on a niche. 9 Meters is one of the latter, taking aim at unmet needs for gastrointestinal patients. The company’s development pipeline features drug candidates under investigation as treatments for short bowel syndrome (SBS) and celiac disease (CeD), two conditions that are both dangerous and difficult to treat.Drilling down to pipeline details, 9 Meters’ flagship product, Larazotide, is in Phase 3 development for the treatment of CeD. CeD affects about 1% of the population, yet there are no approved therapies. Top-line data from the study is expected in the second half of 2021.Furthermore, this past December, the company announced that it had entered an agreement with EBRIS, the European Biomedical Research Institute of Salerno, to investigate Larazotide as a potential treatment for respiratory complications due to COVID-19.The other major drug in the company’s pipeline is NM-002, for SBS. The company has recently announced positive Phase 1b/2a results, with a measurable impact on disease symptoms from a compound that was well-tolerated by patients.NMTR’s strong pipeline and $0.89 share price have scored it substantial praise from the pros on Wall Street.One of these NMTR bulls is Truist’s Srikripa Devarakonda. Citing Larazotide as a key component of his bullish thesis, the analyst noted, “We acknowledge investors are likely to see a pivotal trial in a tough-to-crack Celiac disease program as high risk despite encouraging Ph2b data. We model $705M/$353M in peak unadjusted/adjusted sales and see potential upside of 400% - 1650% from positive Ph3 readout.”Devarakonda also sees “significant unmet need in SBS” and continues to believe that “NM-002 has a differentiated profile vs. SOC.” His key takeaways from the recent Phase 1b/2a results include: “1) we believe that the drug showed early activity in SBS patients; all 9 patients showed meaningful reduction in total stool output volume; average TSO reduction was 42% from baseline; 2) responses occur rapidly, with effects on TSO seen within 48 hours of dosing; 3) safety profile looks favorable, we would like to see greater durability.”To this end, Devarakonda rates NMTR shares a Buy along with a $5 price target. This figure conveys his confidence in NMTR’s ability to soar 462% in the coming year. (To watch Devarakonda’s track record, click here)Turning now to the rest of the Street, other analysts are on the same page. With 4 Buys and no Holds or Sells, the word on the Street is that NMTR is a Strong Buy. Given its $4.33 average price target, upside of 386% could be in store for investors. (See NMTR stock analysis on TipRanks)Orchard Therapeutics (ORTX)Orchard Therapeutics takes the broad-based approach to the biopharma industry. The company is engaged in the development of gene therapies for rare, frequently terminal, diseases, including neurometabolic disorders, primary immune deficiencies, and blood disorders. The gene therapy approach uses blood stem cells to deliver corrected genetic information directly into the patient’s body.Orchard’s pipeline demonstrates the diversity of disorders amenable to gene therapy – the company has no less than 12 drug candidates in development. Among these candidates, Libmeldy (OTL-200) stands out.Libmeldy is in commercialization stages as a treatment for MLD (metachromatic leukodystrophy), a rare, mutation-based genetic disorder of the nervous system. Libmeldy, which is designed to treat children suffering from the infantile for juvenile forms of MLD by replacing the defective ARSA gene, received its approval for medical use in the EU in December 2020.Wedbush analyst David Nierengarten notes the European approval of Libmeldy, and its implication for Orchard’s progress. He writes, “We look forward to the company’s commercial execution in the EU and an eventual 2022 approval in the US. Last month ORTX received IND clearance from the FDA for the program paving the way for discussions with the US regulators to decide a suitable path forward toward a BLA filing.”""Net-net, with possibly two gene therapies approved in the next 12-18 months and a pivotal study beginning in a third (MPS-I), we think ORTX shares are undervalued at these levels,"" the analyst concluded. In line with his bullish comments, Nierengarten rates ORTX as Outperform (i.e. Buy), and his $15 price target indicates a potential for 241% growth in the year ahead. (To watch Nierengarten’s track record, click here)Do other analysts agree with Nierengarten? They do. Only Buy ratings, 3, in fact, have been issued in the last three months. Therefore, ORTX gets a Strong Buy consensus rating. At $15, the average price target indicates shares could appreciate by 241% in the year ahead.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Justice Department and the federal court system disclosed on Wednesday that they were among the dozens of U.S. government agencies and private businesses compromised by a massive cyberespionage campaign that U.S. officials have linked to elite Russia hackers.

The extent of the damage was unclear.

The department said that 3% of its Microsoft Office 365 email accounts were potentially affected, but did not say to whom those accounts belonged. There are no indications that classified systems were affected, the agency said. Office 365 isn’t just email but a collaborative computing environment, which means that shared documents were also surely accessed, said Dmitri Alperovitch, former chief technical officer of the cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike.

Separately, the Administrative Office of U.S. Courts informed federal judicial bodies across the nation that the courts’ nationwide case management system was breached, potentially giving the hackers access to sealed court documents.

The Justice Department said that on Dec. 24 it detected “previously unknown malicious activity” linked to the broader intrusions of federal agencies revealed earlier that month, according to a statement from spokesman Marc Raimondi.

Separately, the court office said on its website that “an apparent compromise” of the U.S. judiciary’s case management and electronic case file system was under investigation.

The Department of Homeland Security was scouring the system, it said, and cited a particular risk to sealed court filings, whose disclosure could jeopardize active criminal investigations.

“The potential reach is vast. The actual reach is probably significant,” said a federal court official who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to disclose the information. The official confirmed that the scope of the compromise was national but it was not clear how widespread.

Full Coverage: Technology

On Tuesday, federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies formally implicated Russia in the intrusions , calling them part of a suspected intelligence gathering operation. President Donald Trump had previously questioned that consensus, suggesting without foundation that China could be to blame.

The hacking campaign was extraordinary in scale, with the intruders stalking through government agencies including the Treasury and Commerce departments, defense contractors and telecommunications companies for months by the time the breach was discovered.

Experts say that gave the foreign agents ample time to collect data that could be highly damaging to U.S. national security, although the scope of the breaches and exactly what information was sought is unknown.

An estimated 18,000 organizations were seeded with malicious code that piggybacked on popular network-management software from an Austin, Texas, company called SolarWinds. But only a subset are believed to have been compromised. Tuesday’s statement said that fewer than 10 federal government agencies have so far been identified as having been hacked.

Johns Hopkins cyberespionage expert Thomas Rid said the 3% figure of email accounts accessed at Justice may not sound like a lot, but that it doesn’t mean that the hackers “didn’t get to the interesting stuff.”

Cybersecurity experts responding to the hack say highly skilled cyber spies of the caliber behind the SolarWinds hack are apt to keep their footprint as small as possible to avoid detection — targeting only high-value email and documents.

Rid wondered how sure the Justice Department could be about the extent of its compromise.

“How good is their own visibility given that U.S. government agencies totally missed the breach in the first place?” he said. “Are they really on top of the problem? Are we only really seeing the tip of the iceberg?”

The breach was discovered by FireEye, a prominent cybersecurity company, on its network. It then identified and notified other victims.

Experts expect the severity of the hack and the number of victims identified to increase over time.

“History tells us that if you have a large breach, not just in one organization but across an entire government — an entire sector — it will take a long time to identify who are the victims and how badly they are compromised,” said Rid.

Microsoft declined to comment on long the intruders were reading emails in the Justice Department’s Office 365 environment, which is typically a cloud-based service hosted by the software provider.

"Jobless claims: Another 803,000 Americans likely filed new unemployment claims last week","TipRanks

It’s a new year, and a good time to choose new stock to line the portfolio. Investment banking giant Goldman Sachs has been watching the markets with an eye toward the long term – and a finger on pulse of the present. The firm is bullish following the passage of the COVID relief bill last month, seeing the direct income assistance of $600 per person – or $1200 for married couples – as a positive for consumers’ disposable income in the here-and-now.And with consumer spending making up some two-thirds of the US economy, and boost to that metric is seen as good for the whole. Taking the COVID relief checks into account, Goldman Sachs' chief economist, Jan Hatzius, raised his expectations for US economic growth in 1Q21 – bumping his GDP forecast from 3% to 5%.“While the income effects of the fiscal package will be very front-loaded, we expect the impact on consumer spending to be more evenly distributed throughout the year,” Hatzius noted. The economist sees current conditions – with lockdowns in place, as putting something of a damper on immediate spending, but leading to pent-up demand later in the year. With that in mind, Hatzius is predicting sequential gains in Q2 and Q3, and full-year GDP growth of 5.8%, up 9% from his previous estimate.The stock analysts at Goldman are keen to follow Hatzius’ lead, and they’ve been combing the market for stocks that are likely to gain as the markets take a long-term rising trajectory. The firm's analysts are pulling the trigger on two stocks in particular, noting that each has the potential to deliver double-digit gains in the year ahead. We ran the two through TipRanks’ database to see what other Wall Street's analysts have to say about them.17 Education & Technology (YQ)The worldwide pandemic had one effect that could never have been predicted in advance: the sudden shift of schools to mass online classes. Remote office work has been around for a long time, and at the secondary and college levels, schools have had long experience with correspondence courses – but mass online learning, even down to the primary level, had never been attempted. Companies like 17 Education, however, take up the challenge of online learning.17 Education is a Chinese company, dedicated to joining technology with high-quality educational content to create more effective and efficient tutoring services for K-12. The program includes both online and in-classroom solutions – 17 Education bills itself as a full-service educational technology provider.It is also a new company to the financial markets. YQ stock went public just this past December, when trading commenced on the 4th of the month. The IPO opened flat, with shares priced at $10.50, the midpoint of the pre-IPO range. By December 9, the share price had nearly doubled. Since then, however, the stock is down 34% from its peak.Among the bulls is Goldman analyst Christine Cho, who initiated her coverage of YQ with a Buy rating and a $21 price target. This figure indicates a 55% upside for the next 12 months. (To watch Cho’s track record, click here)Cho is bullish on the company’s application of big data systems to analyze and streamline classroom solutions, and sees its unique ‘hybrid’ model of combining in-school and online courses as a net plus. “We see [YQ] translating into two potential advantages for its AST [after school tutoring] business: (1) proprietary school-level insights enabling YQ to develop more localized/customized content, and (2) ability to grow paid enrollments rapidly at a low student acquisition cost — a key challenge in the online AST industry — through penetration of organic in-school MAUs…” The Goldman review is one of two on record for 17 Education; the other is also a Buy, making the consensus view a Moderate Buy. The stock is priced at $13.5, and the $20.50 average price target gives an upside potential of ~52%. (See YQ stock analysis on TipRanks)ChampionX Corporation (CHX)17 Education wasn’t the only new ticker to hit the markets at the height of the pandemic, rather, it was one of many. ChampionX is an oilfield technology company that conducted a major change in 1H20. It’s namesake, ChampionX Holdings, merged with Apergy Corp, with the combined company attaching the ChampionX name to the new partner’s trading history. CHX started trading in June 2020, and in December, the company moved its ticker from the NYSE to the NASDAQ.CHX offers a range of oilfield tech solutions, including such specialized applications as drilling fluid and mud additives, fracturing fluid systems, and well cementing, in addition to drilling technologies. These tech services are essential for the oil producers – that own the wells – to get the product to the surface. The essential nature of the service, plus the generally improving economic conditions, led to a Q3 sequential gain in revenues of 112%. The top line came in at $633 million.Analyst Angie Sedita, who covers this stock for Goldman, sees the company in an advantageous position.“We view ChampionX as a strong oilfield service and equipment provider with a global footprint and favorable product mix. Its primary businesses, chemicals and artificial lift, are exposed to the production phase of the life of a well, thus producing lower earnings cyclicality and stronger through-cycle EBITDA. The recent merger of the two companies completed in Q2-20 (Apergy and ChampionX) should drive market share growth and cross-selling opportunities both in the international and U.S. markets,” Sedita wrote.To this end, Sedita initiated coverage on CHX with a Buy rating and a $21 price target. Her target implies a 20% upside for the next 12 months. (To watch Sedita’s track record, click here)All in all, six of Wall Street’s analysts have reviews CHX shares, and 5 said to Buy against 1 who rated it a Hold. This puts the analyst consensus at a Strong Buy. However, the recent share appreciation has pushed the stock price above the average price target of $17.10.

"The Mega Millions jackpot is almost half a billion dollars, the 8th largest in history","(CNN) The Mega Millions jackpot is close to reaching half a billion dollars in what could be the eighth largest prize in the game's history.

The next chance for a lucky winner is Friday, after no ticket matched the all six numbers pulled Tuesday night, according to a Mega Millions news release.

January has a history of big wins for Mega Millions. There have been 16 jackpots awarded during the month since the start of the lottery game in 2002. That includes three of the top Mega Millions prizes -- $451 million on January 5, 2018 ; $437 million on January 1, 2019; and $380 million on January 14, 2011.

The prize money has not cracked the top 10 since June 2019. The highest amount won by a Mega Millions ticket was $1.537 billion in October 2018

2020 was a great year for Mega Millions players, with five jackpot winners and two states getting winners for the first time -- including Arizona, where a player won the year's largest Mega Millions prize with more than $410 million.

Oil Jumps On Major Crude Inventory Draw,"Crude oil prices rose further today after the Energy Information Administration reported a crude oil inventory draw of 8 million barrels for the last week of 2020, despite hefty builds in fuel inventories.

The report came a day after the American Petroleum Institute estimated a relatively modest draw in oil inventories, at 1.66 million barrels. This draw, however, was accompanied by substantial inventory builds in gasoline and middle distillates: 5.47 million barrels and 7.14 million barrels, respectively.

The EIA, for its part, estimated gasoline stocks had added 4.5 million barrels in the week to January 1, with production averaging 8 million bpd. This compared with a draw of 1.2 million barrels for the previous week and production of 9.2 million bpd.

In middle distillates, the authority reported an inventory build of 6.4 million barrels and production of 4.8 million bpd. This compared with an inventory increase of 3.1 million barrels for the previous week and production averaging 4.6 million bpd.

Prices have been on a tear this week, jumping particularly sharply yesterday, after Saudi Arabia announced it would implement unilateral additional oil production cuts of 1 million bpd on top of its OPEC+ mandated cuts.

""We do that willingly and we do that with the purpose of supporting our economy, the economies of our colleagues,"" Saudi Energy Minister Abdulaziz bin Salman told a news conference after yesterday’s OPEC+ meeting, as quoted by CNN. ""We did not ask any country to come forward and do any cuts.""

Indeed, although the extended cartel agreed to leave current production levels relatively flat overall, Russia and Kazakhstan will ramp up their output in February and March.

Despite the quick reaction of prices to the Saudi news, it remains to be seen whether the additional cut will have a lasting effect on supply in the context of still rising numbers of Covid-19 infections, which will continue undermining demand.

Airlines move flight crews to DC airport hotels to avoid Trump protest,"An airline employee walks past empty American Airlines check-in terminals at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport in Arlington, Virginia, on May 12, 2020.

American Airlines started booking crews overnighting in Washington to airport hotels on Tuesday and plans to do the same on Wednesday at a minimum, said Curtis Blessing, an American Airlines spokesman.

United Airlines flight attendants will also be staying at airport hotels this week, while those at Alaska Airlines were told to avoid downtown Washington D.C., said Taylor Garland, spokeswoman for the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA, which represents cabin crews at those airlines and more than a dozen others. The decisions were made before pro-Trump rioters stormed the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday afternoon.

"U.S. government considering banning investments in Alibaba, Tencent by Americans: report","The U.S. government is contemplating a plan that would restrict Americans from buying shares of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. BABA, -5.32% and Tencent Holdings Ltd. TCEHY, -3.97% , according to The Wall Street Journal. The government has been increasingly cracking down on investments in companies that it claims to have ties with the Chinese military. The WSJ report, which cites multiple anonymous sources, said that the U.S. government has been debating whether restrictions on investments in Alibaba and Tencent would have a far-ranging impact on the markets, and it remains uncertain whether the government will go through with such prohibitions. Late Tuesday, the New York Stock Exchange again flipped its stance on whether it will delist three Chinese telecommunications companies-China Telecom Corp. Ltd. CHA, +3.74% , China Mobile Ltd.

With that in mind, Hatzius is predicting sequential gains in Q2 and Q3, and full-year GDP growth of 5.8%, up 9% from his previous estimate.The stock analysts at Goldman are keen to follow Hatzius’ lead, and they’ve been combing the market for stocks that are likely to gain as the markets take a long-term rising trajectory. The firm's analysts are pulling the trigger on two stocks in particular, noting that each has the potential to deliver double-digit gains in the year ahead. We ran the two through TipRanks’ database to see what other Wall Street's analysts have to say about them.17 Education & Technology (YQ)The worldwide pandemic had one effect that could never have been predicted in advance: the sudden shift of schools to mass online classes. Remote office work has been around for a long time, and at the secondary and college levels, schools have had long experience with correspondence courses – but mass online learning, even down to the primary level, had never been attempted. Companies like 17 Education, however, take up the challenge of online learning.17 Education is a Chinese company, dedicated to joining technology with high-quality educational content to create more effective and efficient tutoring services for K-12. The program includes both online and in-classroom solutions – 17 Education bills itself as a full-service educational technology provider.It is also a new company to the financial markets. YQ stock went public just this past December, when trading commenced on the 4th of the month. The IPO opened flat, with shares priced at $10.50, the midpoint of the pre-IPO range. By December 9, the share price had nearly doubled. Since then, however, the stock is down 34% from its peak.Among the bulls is Goldman analyst Christine Cho, who initiated her coverage of YQ with a Buy rating and a $21 price target. This figure indicates a 55% upside for the next 12 months. (To watch Cho’s track record, click here)Cho is bullish on the company’s application of big data systems to analyze and streamline classroom solutions, and sees its unique ‘hybrid’ model of combining in-school and online courses as a net plus. “We see [YQ] translating into two potential advantages for its AST [after school tutoring] business: (1) proprietary school-level insights enabling YQ to develop more localized/customized content, and (2) ability to grow paid enrollments rapidly at a low student acquisition cost — a key challenge in the online AST industry — through penetration of organic in-school MAUs…” The Goldman review is one of two on record for 17 Education; the other is also a Buy, making the consensus view a Moderate Buy. The stock is priced at $13.5, and the $20.50 average price target gives an upside potential of ~52%. (See YQ stock analysis on TipRanks)ChampionX Corporation (CHX)17 Education wasn’t the only new ticker to hit the markets at the height of the pandemic, rather, it was one of many. ChampionX is an oilfield technology company that conducted a major change in 1H20. It’s namesake, ChampionX Holdings, merged with Apergy Corp, with the combined company attaching the ChampionX name to the new partner’s trading history. CHX started trading in June 2020, and in December, the company moved its ticker from the NYSE to the NASDAQ.CHX offers a range of oilfield tech solutions, including such specialized applications as drilling fluid and mud additives, fracturing fluid systems, and well cementing, in addition to drilling technologies. These tech services are essential for the oil producers – that own the wells – to get the product to the surface. The essential nature of the service, plus the generally improving economic conditions, led to a Q3 sequential gain in revenues of 112%. The top line came in at $633 million.Analyst Angie Sedita, who covers this stock for Goldman, sees the company in an advantageous position.“We view ChampionX as a strong oilfield service and equipment provider with a global footprint and favorable product mix. Its primary businesses, chemicals and artificial lift, are exposed to the production phase of the life of a well, thus producing lower earnings cyclicality and stronger through-cycle EBITDA. The recent merger of the two companies completed in Q2-20 (Apergy and ChampionX) should drive market share growth and cross-selling opportunities both in the international and U.S. markets,” Sedita wrote.To this end, Sedita initiated coverage on CHX with a Buy rating and a $21 price target. Her target implies a 20% upside for the next 12 months. (To watch Sedita’s track record, click here)All in all, six of Wall Street’s analysts have reviews CHX shares, and 5 said to Buy against 1 who rated it a Hold. This puts the analyst consensus at a Strong Buy. However, the recent share appreciation has pushed the stock price above the average price target of $17.10.

Microsoft is asking if people want PS5 DualSense features in Xbox Series X/S controllers,"The company also wants to know if its new consoles are “next-gen” enough.

Software and games giant Microsoft is probing if its users want to have some of the features in Sony’s DualSense PS5 controller in its new Xbox Series X and Series S gamepads.

As reported by TechRadar, the company is asking people who recently bought its Xbox Series X or Series S consoles for their thoughts, including whether the hardware “feels next-gen.” Furthermore, Microsoft has asked users whether the PS5’s DualSense had any features that they might want to be included in the new Xbox controller.

Microsoft’s new gamepad already boasts a number of features that the PS4’s DualShock 4 had, including a dedicated button for sharing footage. The Xbox Series X controller was revealed in March 2020, with Microsoft saying that it was easier to hold.

The DualSense controller has received a lot of praise for the changes it has made, including new and improved haptic feedback and the introduction of adaptive triggers which change resistance depending on what is happening in the game.

We had our first look at the DualSense in April of last year. By the time the PS5 was released in November 2020, we described the controller as “mindblowing.”

Samsung QLED TVs take on OLED with Neo Mini-LED precision dimming,"Drew Evans/CNET

CES

Samsung, the biggest TV company in the world, is following up a blockbuster year of sales with new 2021 models that tout even better picture quality and more extras aimed at people spending extra time at home. Its massive, incredibly expensive MicroLED TVs steal the headlines around CES but its lineup of QLED TVs comprise the company's bread and butter.

This year the best Samsung QLED models, including TVs with both 4K and 8K resolution, are called Neo QLED. The name isn't necessarily a reference to Matrix 4 but does include plenty of futuristic-sounding tech, all aimed at dethroning the OLED TVs made by rivals like LG and Sony, which continue to beat QLED in my tests for picture quality.

Now playing: Watch this: Samsung's new Neo QLED TVs promise better picture, gaming...

At the heart of Neo QLED TVs lies a new Mini-LED based, full-array local dimming backlight array that boosts brightness and provides more precise light control. Samsung made its LEDs 40 times smaller than conventional LED units, allowing more to be packed into the TV, and even added a (wait for it...) ""quantum matrix"" to help direct the LED light more accurately. The result, according to the company, is improved HDR highlights with minimal blooming (stray illumination that bleeds from bright into dark areas) as well as better shadow detail.

Samsung also improved its AI upscaling this year to use multiple neural networks (as opposed to just one in previous years) to tweak image quality on both 4K and 8K models.

Neo QLED technology will appear in all of Samsung's 2021 8K QLED models (the QN800A, QN850A and QN900A series), as well as two series of 4K QLED (the QN85A and QN90A). As usual pricing was not announced but if the Q85T is in the same price ballpark as the 2020 Q80T, currently selling for $1,500 at the 65-inch size, it'll be cheaper than OLED and squarely targeted at midpriced TV shoppers.

Beyond the picture, Samsung's new QLED TVs offer a few other new features for 2021.

Samsung

Rechargeable remote with solar cell: In a nod to sustainability Samsung's new remote uses rechargeable batteries instead of disposable ones, which Samsung says could save 20 million AAA batteries every year. In addition to a USB-C port, the clicker can be charged via a solar cell on the back, which even works with indoor lighting.

Game status display and ultrawide aspect ratio: Samsung's new TVs continue to support the next-generation gaming features of PS5 and Xbox Series X, including 4K/120 fps input and VRR, but new for this year you can long-press on the play/pause button of the remote to call up a special status screen, dubbed Game Bar, that clearly indicates which of those features are currently active. You can also play the game in 21:9 or even 32:9 aspect ratios, with black bars filling in the remainder of the TVs' 16:9 screen.

Samsung health with camera-based Smart Trainer: Samsung's health app debuted on its TVs in 2020 and this year it's expanding to offer guided personal training. Plug in an optional webcam (Samsung has a list of recommended cameras, all by Logitech) and the app will track your exercises and give you coaching complete with celebrity personal trainers. Jillian Michaels is the first of six to provide workout content. The smart trainer feature is available on 2021 Q70A TVs and above.

Google Duo video chat: Using an optional webcam again, the Duo app on Samsung TVs allows up to 12 others to join the chat. And if you don't have a camera plugged in you can screen mirror Duo on your phone to the TV and use its camera. It's not Google's more popular Meet software, but at least it's web chat on the big screen.

Google Assistant, Alexa and Bixby voice built-in: Last year Samsung TVs also offered all three voice assistants available via the remote, which included both push-to-talk and hands-free access. In 2021 the company's remotes are push-to-talk only and far-field hands-free mics, which respond to wake words like ""Alexa"" and ""Hey, Google,"" are built into the Q70A and higher TVs. As always you can disable the mics entirely.

Microsoft cloud services, wireless Dex: Connect an optional keyboard and mouse to create or edit Microsoft 365 documents, and even work on two simultaneously on the big screen. Samsung is also expanding the capabilities of its Dex feature, available on Samsung Galaxy phones and tablets, to connect wirelessly.

Samsung's 2021 TVs will start shipping later this year. Exact model names, series and pricing were not announced, and as usual we'll have to wait for the reviews to see how well Neo QLED actually stands up to good old OLED.",['David Katzmaier'],https://news.google.com,high
Get two years of PlayStation Plus for only $58 today,"If you were gifted a PS5 over the holidays or still own a PS4 and need to renew your PlayStation Plus membership, you can snag two one-year PlayStation Plus subscriptions at Eneba for $58 when you enter the discount code 2021PLUS at checkout (while supplies last). Usually, one year of PlayStation Plus would set you back $60, so getting two one-year subscriptions for less than the normal retail price is a real bargain, and this promotion will likely sell out quickly.

Ideally, this is great for a PS4 or PS5 user looking to stack up on PlayStation Plus subscriptions for the next two years, or if you want to gift one PlayStation Plus membership to a friend and keep the other one for yourself. If you don’t need more than one PlayStation Plus membership, Eneba has another promotion allowing you to buy one year for just $30 with code JANDEALS. Otherwise, it’s $31 without the code.

Amazon Might Be Working on an Alexa-Enabled Sleep Apnea Gadget,"Photo : Grant Hindsley/AFP ( Getty Images )

Amazon might be working on an Alexa-enabled device that could potentially track sleep and detect sleep apnea, according to a Business Insider report.

Citing anonymous sources and an internal Amazon document, Business Insider claims the device is about the size of a person’s palm and looks like a hexagonal pad with a metal wire base. It’s meant to be placed on a person’s nightstand. The interesting bit is that the device will purportedly be contactless, utilizing millimeter-wave radar to track breathing and movement during sleep to detect whether someone may have sleep apnea. The device will probably also connect to other devices, as well as have a companion app for notifications. Internally, the project is supposedly called “Brahms”, after the composer Johannes Brahms. You know, the guy famous for writing lullabies, possibly because he, too, suffered from obstructive sleep apnea.

The report goes on to note that in the past year, Amazon has expanded the team responsible for building this device, and plans to build a “sleep-analysis” program that goes beyond sleep apnea.

Gizmodo reached out to Amazon regarding Business Insider’s report but did not immediately receive a response.

G/O Media may get a commission RAVPower MagSafe Charger $26 at Amazon Use the promo code KJEH28AR

If true, this isn’t terribly surprising news. In recent months, Amazon has signaled many times that it’s interested in expanding its healthcare and wearable tech business . Since November, Amazon has launched its Amazon Pharmacy service, added fitness tracking features to its Echo Buds, and also launched Halo, its very first fitness tracker.

The fact that Amazon may be targeting sleep apnea also makes sense. Sleep tracking devices aren’t new, and to set itself apart, Amazon would likely offer a feature that currently isn’t available. Of the medical conditions that health and wearable tech might be able to detect, sleep apnea is still up for grabs, affects an estimated 22 million Americans, and isn’t particularly easy to officially diagnose. Apple claimed its stake on atrial fibrillation via an ECG app way back in 2018 with the Apple Watch Series 4—and it took until 2020 for Fitbit and Samsung to catch up. Samsung has focused heavily on monitoring blood pressure. Meanwhile, Fitbit has been banging on about potentially detecting sleep apnea for years now, starting with the introduction of SpO2 sensors in its Ionic smartwatch. However, it wasn’t until early 2020 when it finally released its Estimated Oxygen Variation metric. At that time, Fitbit noted it was seeking FDA-clearance for a sleep apnea detection feature. Withings also announced its ScanWatch smartwatch last year, which also claimed to detect sleep apnea, though it’s still pending clearance from the FDA. Here we are a year later, and crickets.

On top of that, sleep tracking has become an increasingly desirable feature, despite questions about overall accuracy. Apple finally added native sleep tracking with watchOS 7 in 2020. Recovery-focused, sleep tracking wearables like Whoop and the Oura Ring also nabbed headlines last year, partly because these devices were being used in studies to see whether they could detect covid-19. In any case, the global market for sleep tracking devices is expected to grow nearly 16% to $43.5 billion by 2026. You know Amazon wants a piece of that.",[],https://news.google.com,high
Upcoming Apple privacy update has developers desperately seeking dodges,"App developers are exploring surreptitious new forms of user tracking to evade Apple’s new privacy rules, which threaten to upend the mobile advertising industry in the coming months.

Early in 2021, an iPhone update will prevent apps from using advertising identifiers known as IDFA without obtaining each user’s explicit consent for targeting. Developers expect more than two-thirds of users will block tracking when they see a popup appear within their apps.

Some app makers say they plan to use invasive tracking techniques such as “device fingerprinting” to work around the new restrictions—even though doing so risks getting them thrown off the App Store if they are caught.

“100 percent, everyone will try doing fingerprints, whether Apple enforces their rules or not,” one mobile games developer said.

Privacy campaigners have welcomed Apple’s changes but warn that it is never possible to eliminate tracking entirely.

“There is still going to be tracking,” said Andrés Arrieta, director of consumer privacy engineering at Electronic Frontier Foundation, a campaigner for digital rights. “We will still see apps trying to do nefarious things. No matter what you do, you will have those bad actors.”

Facebook has led criticism of Apple’s change, taking out a series of newspaper advertisements in December that accused Apple of depriving app makers of as much as half of their ad revenues by removing personalization.

Few other developers are willing to pick a public fight with Apple, whose App Store acts as gatekeeper to a $500 billion economy. But privately, the creators of some of the App Store’s most popular apps are fretting, given the importance of advertising as a means of both revenue and distribution.

“The impact is close to impossible to predict,” said the head of one large mobile games developer.

“This is a huge, huge change,” said the chief of another leading mobile games developer. “It’s the biggest risk that we have [as a company]... It could really affect us negatively.”

Developers are concerned that many in the advertising industry are still unaware of the magnitude of the coming changes. “Brands and agencies have no idea—they don’t have a full grasp on where the ecosystem is headed,” said a policy executive at one app maker. “Tech intermediaries are being forced to solve the problem.”

Under such pressure, some developers are, in desperation, considering using new and more invasive forms of tracking, even if users deny their apps permission to use IDFA.

Device fingerprinting can be used to recognize repeat visits from the same smartphone, even across multiple apps. The technique, which is banned by Apple’s App Store rules but can be difficult to detect, works by correlating a combination of a device’s hardware and software characteristics, configurations such as Internet connections, battery or language settings, and patterns of usage.

Another way to track people between apps is if they use the same email address to sign up for various services and games. “Hashed emails,” whereby addresses are turned into a string of letters and numbers, allow companies to share user details without directly handing over an individual’s email address to their partners.

While these techniques might be difficult for Apple to detect, the cost of being caught—and losing access to the world’s most lucrative mobile storefront—could be enormous. “Do you want to play with fire?” one developer asked.

WhatsApp gives users an ultimatum: Share data with Facebook or stop using the app,"WhatsApp, the Facebook-owned messenger that claims to have privacy coded into its DNA, is giving its 2 billion plus users an ultimatum: agree to share their personal data with the social network or delete their accounts.

The requirement is being delivered through an in-app alert directing users to agree to sweeping changes in the WhatsApp terms of service. Those who don’t accept the revamped privacy policy by February 8 will no longer be able to use the app.

Share and share alike

Shortly after Facebook acquired WhatsApp for $19 billion in 2014, its developers built state-of-the-art end-to-end encryption into the messaging app. The move was seen as a victory for privacy advocates because it used the Signal Protocol, an open source encryption scheme whose source code has been reviewed and audited by scores of independent security experts.

In 2016, WhatsApp gave users a one-time ability to opt out of having account data turned over to Facebook. Now, an updated privacy policy is changing that. Come next month, users will no longer have that choice. Some of the data that WhatsApp collects includes:

User phone numbers

Other people’s phone numbers stored in address books

Profile names

Profile pictures and

Status message including when a user was last online

Diagnostic data collected from app logs

Under the new terms, Facebook reserves the right to share collected data with its family of companies.

“As part of the Facebook family of companies, WhatsApp receives information from, and shares information with, this family of companies,” the new privacy policy states. “We may use the information we receive from them, and they may use the information we share with them, to help operate, provide, improve, understand, customize, support, and market our Services and their offerings.”

In some cases, such as when someone uses WhatsApp to interact with third-party businesses, Facebook may also share information with those outside entities.

A lack of transparency

The move comes a month after Apple started requiring iOS app makers, including WhatsApp, to detail the information they collect from users. WhatsApp, according to the App Store, reserves the right to collect:

Purchases

Financial information

Location

Contacts

User content

Identifiers

Usage data and

Diagnostics

A WhatsApp spokeswoman declined to speak on the record about the changes and precisely how or if it’s possible for users to opt out of them. She agreed to email additional information on the condition it be kept on background, meaning none of the details can be quoted verbatim.

The move, the spokeswoman said, is part of a previously disclosed move to allow businesses to store and manage WhatsApp chats using Facebook's infrastructure. Users won't have to use WhatsApp to interact with the businesses and have the option of blocking the businesses. She said there will be no change in how WhatsApp shares provides data with Facebook for non-business chats and account data.

Together, the WhatsApp privacy policy and terms of service are more than 8,000 words long and are filled with legal jargon that makes it difficult for non-lawyers to understand. WhatsApp is doing its users a disservice by not agreeing to speak on the record so that reporters can fully understand the changes and explain them to readers.

People who object to the new terms and policy should consider using a different messenger. The Signal messenger provides the same robust encryption engine with a much more transparent privacy policy and terms of service. (Those documents are half the length of those from WhatsApp, too.) Besides providing encrypted chats, Signal also offers encrypted audio and video calls.

"CES 2021 preview: 5G, TVs and yes, masks","CES 2021 will be a virtual event this year as the latest in tech vies for attention, while dealing with the coronavirus pandemic impacting the globe.

""Masks of all kinds, voice assistants mature, 5G will power everything, more 8K TV sets, [and] robots…for more practical purposes,"" Greg Kahn, CEO GK Digital Ventures and the Internet of Things Consortium, told Fox News.

Fox News has compiled a list of some of the technology that could be front and center virtually starting Jan. 11.

RANSOMWARE WILL LIKELY GET WORSE IN 2021: REPORT

8K AND MINI-LED TVS

With roughly 33 million pixels – four times that of mainstream 4K – pricey 8K TVs are still out of reach for most consumers. That fact won’t stop manufacturers such as Samsung and LG from pushing these at CES.

Mini-LED display tech, which provides better brightness, color, and contrast compared to current LCD TVs, will also be a theme. LG will show off its own spin on mini-LED with something called QNED.

Samsung is also expected to reveal new Micro LED TVs.

5G FOR REAL

The fast cellular network made a splash at CES in 2020 but it wasn’t widely available then. Expect more this year as the latest phones, such as the new iPhone 12, are equipped with 5G now.

Verizon’s CEO Hans Vestberg’s will be hosting a live keynote on Jan. 11 with 5G as a theme.

The promise of 5G is future gadgets like smart glasses with augmented reality. Major carriers are also beginning to offer home 5G internet.

CORONAVIRUS CAUSING DELIVERY SCAMS TO RISE

MASKS, AIR FILTRATION

Masks are now a fashion trend but with a very practical purpose amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

High-tech masks with proprietary antibacterial, antiviral, filtration and breathability technologies are expected to be unveiled at CES, as are smart air purifiers and UV disinfecting lights, according to media reports.

LG announced its PuriCare Wearable Air Purifier this summer. It’s equipped with HEPA filters and includes a respiratory sensor that detects the cycle and volume of the user’s breathing in order to adjust the speed of built-in fans.

INTERNET OF THINGS AND HEALTH MONITORING

Consumers should expect a range of health monitoring devices and apps as well.

Wearable devices and apps that allow more independence for the elderly are also likely, said GK Digital Ventures’ Kahn. ""Several pill bottles, for example, are now Internet-enabled and contain sensors that send data to the cloud regarding time of cap opening, closing and medication removed to avoid errors.""

OTHER TECH, INCLUDING ROBOTS AND VOICE-ENABLED GADGETS

Some other technology to watch out for is ever more practical robots. And more intelligent voice assistants offered on more products such as Amazon Echo Loop Ring and Amazon Frames as well as voice-enabled door locks.

Also, electric cars and self-driving tech have been prominent at CES over the past several years. This year, GM is expected to have a lot to say about its future electric vehicles, with CEO Mary Barra the keynote speaker on Jan. 12th.

Sony Unveils Crystal LED Displays for Virtual Production,"The displays were developed by Sony Electronics in collaboration with Sony Pictures Entertainment, with an eye toward production uses.

Just prior to next week's virtual CES, Sony Electronics announced a pair of new Crystal LED modular direct view displays aimed at professional applications including virtual production — an area that has experienced an uptick in interest during the past year and has been used on projects from The Midnight Sky to The Mandalorian.

Sony calls attention to the C-series for its high contrast ratio and B-series for accentuating high brightness. Sony reports that the B-series was developed in collaboration with Sony Pictures Entertainment to reflect the needs of production. For instance, it features an anti-reflection coating with a matte finish, with an eye toward virtual sets.

Both series are equipped with Sony's ""X1 for Crystal LED” processor and incorporate the same Crystal LED technology used in its Bravia TVs. Features include the ability to display high dynamic range images, high frame rates up to 120 frames per second and stereoscopic 3D. They are also fanless, for quieter operation.

A virtual production environment using the tech giant's current display technology (which was initially unveiled for additional uses including digital cinema) can be found at Sony's Digital Media Production Center, an L.A.-based venture for filmmakers. That setup was featured in the Sony exhibition a year ago at CES 2020.

The new Crystal LED C-series and B-series are planned to be available this summer. Pricing wasn't announced.","['Carolyn Giardina', 'Carolyn.Giardina Thr.Com']",https://news.google.com,high
Minecraft Earth is shutting down this summer,"It’s almost time to say goodbye to Minecraft Earth, because Mojang Studios are shutting it down for good on June 30th. It’s not all doom and gloom, though. If you’ve spent money in the Pokémon Go-like sandbox app, you’ll be able to grab some parting gifts before it heads to the big mobile phone in the sky. That is: some free money for the Minecraft Marketplace, and a free copy of Minecraft Bedrock edition.

“Minecraft Earth was designed around free movement and collaborative play – two things that have become near impossible in the current global situation,” the devs say. “As a result, we have made the difficult decision to re-allocate our resources to other areas that provide value to the Minecraft community and to end support for Minecraft Earth.”

The game received its final update yesterday, removing microtransactions and adding in all the currently finished but unreleased content for players to try out. They’ve also reduced the amount of time it takes to complete tasks like crafting, and reduced the prices of in-game items to make it a little easier to play.

Players who’ve spent real-life money on rubies, the game’s premium currency, will receive Minecoins to spend in the Minecraft Marketplace (where you can buy player-made skins and adventures). Then, players who’ve spent any money on the app will be given a copy of Minecraft Bedrock edition for their mobile device – which is cool to have because Minecraft has cross-platform progression, so you could take your PC saves with you on the go.

Minecraft Earth came out towards the end of 2019, so it will have managed about a year and a half of life by the time it shuts down in June. Unfortunately, that year just so happened to be a bit of a rubbish one for a game that encourages going outside to meet your pals.

So, as of July 1st you’ll no longer be able to download or play it, and Mojang will be deleting all Minecraft Earth player data. Have a look at the Minecraft Earth Sunset FAQ for more details.

14-Inch and 16-Inch MacBook Pro Models Expected to Boost Apple Silicon's Market Share in Second Half of 2021,"Apple is expected to release new 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models with Apple silicon in the second half of 2021, boosting Apple's market share of notebook CPUs to about 7%, according to Taiwanese research firm TrendForce.



In July 2020, analyst Ming-Chi Kuo claimed that new 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models with Apple silicon and an all-new design will launch in the late second quarter or third quarter of this year. Kuo later added that these MacBook Pro models will feature Mini-LED displays for increased brightness, improved contrast, richer colors, and more.

Apple previously indicated that its transition away from Intel processors in Macs will take about two years to be completed, with other rumored Apple silicon Macs including a redesigned 24-inch iMac and a smaller Mac Pro-like desktop computer. Last month, Nikkei Asia reported that a new iMac Pro is also in the works for 2021.

TrendForce said that Intel faces increasing competitive pressure from both Apple and AMD in the CPU market and will need to deliver an ""appropriate product strategy"" in response. Last month, New York-based hedge fund Third Point urged Intel to take ""immediate"" action to restructure and curb the loss of talented chip designers.

Apple's first M1 chip has proven to be very impressive, with the base model MacBook Air outperforming the highest-end Intel-based 16-inch MacBook Pro in benchmarks. Apple says the chip delivers industry-leading performance per watt.","['Joe Rossignol', 'Hartley Charlton', 'Frank Mcshan', 'Tim Hardwick']",https://news.google.com,high
Nintendo once laughed Xbox execs out of the room over a Microsoft acquisition offer,"Microsoft’s Xbox consoles are considered a pillar of the industry, part of a trifecta that makes up modern gaming. The first Xbox launched in 2001; the Xbox Series X and S arrived just last year. Today, Xbox is a powerhouse, yet it wasn’t always so. Bloomberg’s Dina Bass published an oral history on the creation of Microsoft’s Xbox that recounts the console’s conception, from an executive retreat through release day — with snags like a failed bid at Nintendo detailed along the way.

The original Xbox was known as Midway — or Coffin Box to some, according to Xbox technology officer Seamus Blackley, “because they worried that it would fail and end their career at Microsoft.” As part of an effort to lock in exclusive games, Microsoft tried to acquire companies like Electronic Arts, Midway Games, and Square. Kevin Bachus, director of third-party relations, says that president and later Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer also made the team meet with Nintendo. Their pitch revolved around the technical powers of the Xbox. It did not go as planned.

“They just laughed their asses off,” Bachus told Bloomberg. “Like, imagine an hour of somebody just laughing at you. That was kind of how that meeting went.”

Bloomberg’s story goes on to explore the console’s actual achievements, including its successful bid for Halo creator Bungie. The full piece is well worth a read, especially for the anecdote about an unnamed Konami executive.

As for Nintendo, chairman of Nintendo America Howard Lincoln told the publication that the company “does not talk about confidential discussions with other companies. In any event, nothing came of these discussions.”","['Megan Farokhmanesh', 'Jan']",https://news.google.com,high
Bose's new earbuds don't actually go in your ears,"There are plenty of truly wireless earbuds on the market, but not many of them can claim to be as unique as the new Bose Sport Open Earbuds. They're IPX4 rated, can go for 8 hours of battery life on a single charge — and make virtually no skin contact, sitting above the ear and allowing listeners to stay aware of their surroundings in a way that practically no other earbud can do.

According to Bose, the buds gently grip the ear's outer ridge in order to remain locked in place with no need for an in-ear tip. There's also no squeezing or vibration since these don't utilize the same audio-delivery methods as bone conduction earbuds. Instead, each bud uses ""a tiny dipole transducer placed and positioned for loud-and-clear personal audio that stays at the ear."" That should make them great for listening to music, podcasts, and more while staying alert during everyday actives and workouts. This idea of piping-in audio a short distance from your ear is also something we saw in the Bose Frames.

The buds open design remind me of an old-school Bluetooth earpiece.

The Bose Sport Open Earbuds have simple button controls that allow for quick access to common tasks like skipping songs or summoning your voice assistant. With an IPX4 water resistance rating, these should be primed to handle sweaty workouts and rainy jogging sessions. And thanks to an etched antenna and Bluetooth 5.1, the connection seems like it should be reliably solid, too. The buds are compatible with both Android and iOS, with an app to control and personalize sound settings.

Bose's new buds are available for pre-order today at the manufacturer's website and Best Buy for just about $200. They should start shipping out to consumers later this month.",['Caleb Potts'],https://news.google.com,high
Facebook overhauls Pages to remove ‘Likes’ and streamline user interface,"Facebook is out today with a major update to Facebook Pages that includes removing “Likes,” an all-new layout for the UI, a dedicated News Feed, simpler navigation, refreshed admin controls for partial or full privileges, new insights as well as safety and integrity features.

Facebook announced the new Pages experience in a blog post and said the overhaul is starting to roll out today. Here are the new key features/changes:

Redesigned layout that’s simpler and more intuitive

that’s simpler and more intuitive Dedicated News Feed to discover and join conversations, follow trends, interact with peers and engage with fans

to discover and join conversations, follow trends, interact with peers and engage with fans Easy navigation between personal profile and Pages

between personal profile and Pages Updated task-based admin controls giving trusted Page admins full control or partial access

giving trusted Page admins full control or partial access Actionable insights and more relevant notifications

and more relevant notifications Safety and integrity features to detect spammy content and impersonator accounts

The new UI is designed to make it easier to switch between personal profiles and public Pages. Facebook says it’s also “cleaner and more streamlined” than before. It has a focus on bios, posts, and important info.

Here’s how Facebook describes the dedicated News Feed for Pages:

We are bringing the power of News Feed to Pages for the first time. Now Pages can discover and join conversations, follow trends, interact with peers and engage with fans. The dedicated News Feed will also suggest new connections — other public figures, Pages, Groups and trending content that a Page or public figure cares about. To make Page conversations more visible to a wider audience and surfaced more frequently in their followers’ News Feed, comments from public figures will be bumped to the top of the comments section. People will also be able to follow Pages directly from comments and recommendations posts.

Another focus is “richer interactive conversations” so the Pages reboot includes a new text-based Q&A format.

No more Likes

A big change with this update is the removal of likes for Pages. Facebook has shifted this to Followers:

We are removing Likes and focusing on Followers to simplify the way people connect with their favorite Pages. Unlike Likes, Followers of a Page represent the people who can receive updates from Pages, which helps give public figures a stronger indication of their fan base.

Admins will likely be glad to see improved management features:

We’ve added new Page management features — like the ability to more clearly assign and manage admin access permissions based on specific tasks. For example, you’ll now be able to grant varying levels of access to manage specific tasks including Insights, Ads, Content, and Community Activity & Messages. This will also ensure account safety and integrity.

Finally, Facebook says it’s using the verified badge to help keep the community safe along with improving it’s detection of blocked content:

We want Facebook to be a safe place to connect with fans, so we’ve improved our ability to detect activity that isn’t allowed on our platform including hate speech, violent, sexual or spammy content and impersonation. We are continuing to expand the visibility of a verified badge to make it easier to identify posts and comments from authentic Pages and profiles. A verified Page’s comment on another Page’s public post, may appear higher in the comments section and be visible in News Feed.

The new Pages is starting to roll out today, but Facebook says it will show up for all users in the “upcoming months.”

Your Windows 10 Taskbar Is About to Get News and Weather,"Microsoft knows what Windows 10’s taskbar really needs: News and Weather. That My People icon didn’t pan out, but surely all Windows users want one-click access to the latest news—right?

Microsoft is already testing this change in Insider builds of Windows 10. Starting January 6, 2021, with Insider build 21286, people testing unstable versions of Windows 10 will begin seeing the widget.

It will appear to the left of your notification area (often, but incorrectly, called the “system tray.”) It will show the current weather in your area—right on the taskbar. If you click it, you’ll see news headlines, more information about the weather, stock market movements, and sports scores. Microsoft calls it “an integrated feed of dynamic content such as news and weather that updates throughout the day.”

Of course, you can customize what you want to see in the feed, and you can hide this Weather and News widget, just like you can hide the My People widget today. All you have to do is right-click your taskbar and uncheck it.

Microsoft is testing variations on this feature, so it may not look identical when it reaches your PC. Based on Microsoft’s development schedule, we’d expect to see this feature hit stable Windows 10 PCs with a big update scheduled for Fall 2021—or, if Microsoft is really rushing, Spring 2021.",[],https://news.google.com,high
Nest Cam IQ Outdoor discontinued ahead of a new Nest camera lineup,"Google's Nest Cam IQ Outdoor has been discontinued as the Google Store has sold through the last of its stock. Don't worry if you were hoping to pick one up, though, as Google also confirms a whole new lineup of security cameras is set to land later this year. However, the recently sold-out model will continue to get software updates and feature support.

Stock for the $399 IP-rated Nest Cam IQ Outdoor has been fluctuating across Google's various regional storefronts for the last few weeks. Google has since confirmed it has ""sold out"" of the product, which will no longer be available to purchase through the Google Store, though it will continue to get updates (as we'd hope given the price). In our review, we found it a capable smart home security camera with class-leading video quality and functionality, though the price tag was problematic — not that it matters now. Although some third-party retailers are still selling them, it sounds like the camera has been discontinued.

That brings us to this latest development: According to a statement provided to 9to5Google, confirmed to us by Google, a new set of smart home cameras will debut later this year. A Google spokesperson tells us, ""Nest will keep investing in new innovations, including a new lineup of security cameras for 2021."" Other details about the lineup weren't provided, but here's hoping they hit a more competitive price than the current models.

Google's clearly been aware that pricing for its smart home suite is a problem, as last year it revamped Nest Aware pricing to make it more affordable on a per-camera basis (though the change wasn't all for the better). Other hardware products in the current lineup range from $129 for the basic Nest Cam Indoor to $300 for the Nest Cam IQ Indoor. That's a lot more than many other Assistant-compatible cameras cost, especially given the random issues they have. Other smart home companies like Wyze have been undercutting Google by a literal order of magnitude on price for their Assistant-connected cameras, so we have to assume Google's paying attention.

Just a few days ago, a new and likely Nest-branded device hit the FCC. We aren't sure what it is, but it's got a screen, Soli, and Zigbee tech inside it — maybe a Nest Secure successor or a new smart display, or both? Whatever it ends up being, it could be a part of the new lineup when it lands. And given the delay between FCC appearance and launch is usually just a month or two, we may not have too long to wait.",['Ryne Hager'],https://news.google.com,high
The Galaxy S21 Ultra may be Samsung's first to support 120Hz+QHD,"The Galaxy S21 Ultra may be Samsung’s first phone to finally support 120Hz at QHD resolution

The Samsung Galaxy S20 series was Samsung’s first lineup to feature a high refresh rate (120Hz) display. There was one small problem with the execution, though. You could only run your S20 (and Note 20) at its native QHD resolution or 120Hz refresh rate, but not both simultaneously. It’s not exactly clear why you couldn’t do both; the display processors in the Exynos 990 and Snapdragon 865 were likely capable and the bandwidth was likely there to drive that resolution and frame rate, so it’s possible that Samsung had power consumption concerns with that resolution and frame rate combination. (For what it’s worth, the Tab S7 series supports running its display at its native resolution and 120Hz refresh rate.) Fortunately, for the next-gen Galaxy S21 Ultra, Samsung appears to have finally enabled support for 120Hz refresh rate at the native WQHD+ (3200 x 1400) resolution.

The calls for Samsung to support that feature came from every corner of the tech community, and it seems like Samsung is finally addressing these concerns for its early 2021 flagships. The Galaxy S21 Ultra will be the highest-end model of Samsung’s upcoming lineup, and users will finally have the ability to turn on both display features at the same time if a leak from Ice Universe is to be believed.

👏Galaxy S21 Ultra realizes WQHD+ resolution and 120Hz adaptive refresh rate can be turned on at the same time pic.twitter.com/FpiB8jAxyC — Ice universe (@UniverseIce) January 5, 2021

The S21 Ultra is set to feature the same 5000 mAh battery as the S20 Ultra, but it’s rumored to feature way better battery life. This is possible because of the improved efficiency of the VRR OLED display tech first used in the Note20 Ultra, allowing the device to switch to seamlessly switch to lower refresh rates when needed to reduce power drain. If this is true, then running both features at the same time shouldn’t be as much of a battery concern. The new Galaxy S21 series should be announced at the upcoming Unpacked event on January 14th, so we should be able to know more about this very soon.

Next-Gen Assassin's Creed Reportedly Releasing Next Year,"✖

A proper next-gen Assassin's Creed game on PS5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S is reportedly releasing next year. Adding to this, the new report, claims that Ubisoft will use 2021 to focus on Assassin's Creed Valhalla, which will be primarily bolstered with two separate single-player expansions. That said, while 2021 won't feature a new Assassin's Creed game, 2022 reportedly will, and its development will be helmed by Ubisoft Sofia, the company's Bulgarian studio.

Ubisoft Sofia isn't known as one of Ubisoft's lead studios, with the bulk of its existence since it was founded in 2006 being primarily a support studio and a studio that works on handheld games. However, it has served as the lead studio behind two Assassin's Creed games: Assassin's Creed Rogue and Assassin's Creed III: Liberation.

As for the report, it comes the way of French streamer and YouTuber xj0nathan, who doesn't divulge much else of consequence other than the aforementioned information. The big thing with Assassin's Creed games, at least in the modern era, is the setting. Right now, there's no word from any reputable source where the game will be set, but there have been some dubious rumors pointing towards the series heading to China, or more specifically, ancient China.

Of course, not only should these rumors be taken with a massive grain of salt, but take all of the other information with a grain of salt. Not only is all of the unofficial variety, but it's vague enough that it's unclear what is scoop and what is speculation.

At the moment of publishing, Ubisoft has not commented on this report in any capacity, and it's unlikely it will, as it maintains a pretty strict ""no comment"" policy when it comes to rumors, reports, and anything and everything of the speculative and unofficial variety.

Microsoft Flight Simulator’s real-time snow looks magical,"Shortly before the Christmas holiday, the developers behind Microsoft Flight Simulator released a new free update for the cutting-edge platform. It introduced virtual reality for those with high-end machines, and it also added real-time snow effects all across the globe. On Monday, the team released a lavish new trailer showing off their virtual snow machine, and it looks nothing short of magical.

Flight Simulator draws from more than two petabytes of Bing Maps imagery, including satellite and photogrammetry, to create a realistic simulation of the surface of the entire planet. But that kind of data can only be captured clearly on bright, sunny days. That limitation effectively locked the world in an endless summer ever since the game launched in August 2020. Now, the team at Asobo Studio has divined a way to map virtual snow on top of those summer landscapes in real time. It’s a remarkable technical feat, and it makes the already-gorgeous game that much more inspiring to look at.

The next step will naturally be to add fall colors to the map. Asobo could add that with one of the four or five World Updates or three large simulation updates promised throughout 2021, all of which will be free to owners. The next major update will add further detail to the United Kingdom. Microsoft Flight Simulator is also expected to launch for the Xbox Series X in the summer.","['Charlie Hall', 'Austen Goslin', 'Matt Patches', 'Nicole Carpenter', 'Owen S.

Netflix won't work on Nintendo's Wii U and 3DS after June 30th,"Netflix will stop streaming to Nintendo 3DS and Wii U devices later this year. In a support document spotted by Eurogamer, Nintendo says the company will discontinue support for the two consoles on June 30th, 2021 (coincidently, that’s the same day Minecraft Earth is set to shutdown). Netflix has already removed its app from the eShop, making it impossible to download unless it’s already associated with your account. If you have the software installed on your console, you can continue to use it to stream content from Netflix until the end of June. Afterward, you’ll need to look to other options if the Wii U or 3DS is your primary way of accessing the platform.

Who is this shutdown likely to affect? Probably the same desperate souls accessing Pornhub through their 3DS and Wii U. It’s more people than you might think, but far from a significant number. More than anything, the move is likely to highlight the fact you still can’t download Netflix on the Nintendo Switch, even though it’s far more popular than the Wii U and better suited to mobile watching than the 3DS.",[],https://news.google.com,high
How Singer Transformed the Porsche 911 Into a Beastly Off-Road Racer,"Singer Vehicle Design made its name by reimagining the Porsche 911, but after debuting the results of its Dynamics and Lightweighting Study in 2018 it seemed the company had found the outer limit to just how far it could push the model in terms of performance and design. Turns out, there was still more to come. This morning, Singer unveiled the culmination of its second major client-requested research and development project, the All-Terrain Competition Study (ACS), culminating in 911 rally racers reborn to tackle Dakar or Baja.

“We at Singer are motorsport nerds in our hearts and demonstrating our understanding of the discipline required our off-road vision to display deeply legitimate competition credentials from the structural engineering, to the bodywork ethos, to the mechanical package,” said Rob Dickinson, Singer’s founder and executive chairman, in the official announcement. “So much of what we’ve done for the last decade has been inspired by Porsche’s competition success and the All-terrain Competition Study provides us the opportunity to showcase that idea literally and vividly.”

While influenced by the Porsche 911 SC/RS examples campaigned by the likes of Rothmans in the World Rally Championships (WRC) of the 1980s—Rothmans won 12 prominent rally races in 1984 and ’85 alone with the model—Southern California–based Singer selected the 1990 Porsche 964 platform for the ACS-modified vehicles.

Crucial to the process was Singer’s collaboration with rally expert Richard Tuthill and his team, winners of the 2019 East African Safari Classic as well as numerous other top finishes in the sport. Tuthill, whose facility is in Oxfordshire, UK, also worked on the original Rothmans cars back in the day.

Presenting a substantially elevated ride height, the permanent all-wheel-drive coupe with plated limited-slip differentials is powered by an air-cooled, 3.6-liter twin-turbo flat-six engine mated to a five-speed sequential transmission. Singer claims output begins at 450 hp and 420 ft lbs of torque, but varies depending on the intended form of competition. Beneath the carbon-fiber body panels lies a bolstered monocoque chassis, a long-travel suspension system with five-way adjustable dampers (two per corner) and an enlarged fuel tank.

The entire package runs on 8-inch x 16-inch forged aluminum wheels shod in BF Goodrich All-Terrain rubber and complemented by four-piston monoblock steel disc brakes. Onboard features include race-specific GPS navigation, a pair of full-size spare tires and an integrated hydration system for the driver and navigator.

“It was really the chassis development that took a while,” said Singer CEO Mazen Fawaz during a conversation with Robb Report about the study, which was roughly three years in the making. “Richard [Tuthill] led that. And then you have a body structure that needed to be designed, and that’s a process that Rob [Dickinson] led. This is not just a 911 with a roll cage. We knew we had to go big. We don’t really do trendy. We had to do something that’s going to be a competitive off-road desert racer. Fully engineered, it’s like a WRC racing car with some trophy truck in it.”

And Fawaz should know, as he’s raced trophy trucks with Formula 1 driver Jenson Button’s team, Rocket Motorsport, and plans to do so again this season. Testing of the ACS-modified Porsches will be done with a team consisting of Fawaz, Tuthill, Le Mans veteran Marino Franchitti and automotive consultant Chris Harris.

According to Fawaz, the car’s first official event will most likely be the National Off-Road Racing Association’s Yokohama Mexican 1000, in April. Once delivery of the two vehicles—one in Parallax White and the other, tailored more to paved explorations, in Corsica Red—is made to the commissioning customer, the ACS package will be available to other Singer clients, with pricing determined by the extent of modifications desired. Each example will be completed in the UK and comes with the option of racing support from Tuthill and crew.

Talking about the first car produced, Fawaz sounds like a proud parent. “It’s this perfect balance of heritage and capability, and there’s no shortcut on it—it’s very Singer,” he says. “In our heads, we wouldn’t change it. And when you get there, it’s very exciting.”","['Viju Mathew', ""Viju Mathew'S Most Recent Stories"", 'How Singer Transformed The Porsche Into A Beastly Off-Road Racer', 'First Ride', 'The Polaris Slingshot Thinks It S A Supercar', 'It Might Be Right', 'After Disappearing For Years', 'British Marque Alvis Car Company Is Back']",https://news.google.com,high
Amazon marked free podcasts as costing $8.95 with a discount for Audible subscribers,"Charlie Harding, the host of the podcast Switched On Pop, noticed something strange when he searched his podcast name on Amazon yesterday: a price tag. An $8.95 price, to be exact, marked as a “limited deal” with the suggestion to buy an Audible subscription to get a discount.

Harding’s show, which details the making and meaning of popular music, is already freely available in all podcast apps through an RSS feed. It also recently became available for free inside Audible, which is owned by Amazon, when podcasts were added to its app in October. But for some reason, Amazon had started advertising the show as paid content. Even more strangely, the Audible promotion was really for a price hike, marking the show as originally costing $0 and being marked up to $8.95.

The same happened with other podcasts available in Audible, too. All the ones we checked, including The Verge’s own Vergecast, which is freely distributed through RSS, were listed as costing $8.95 and promoted an Audible membership deal. These results only showed up on Amazon’s website, not in the mobile app, and only if you were logged into an Amazon account when you searched. If you clicked on the podcast, you’d then be able to select where you wanted to listen, either Amazon Music or Audible, and you could listen for free without a subscription.

The pricing disappeared Wednesday morning after The Verge reached out for comment. Amazon has not yet responded.

It’s unclear why Amazon marked the shows as costing $8.95 given that none of Audible’s subscription tiers are that price. Its lowest tier, which it launched in August, costs $7.95 for access to these free shows, as well as exclusive Audible programming and audiobooks. The price goes up to $14.95 for a subscription that includes audiobook credits. This seems more than likely to be a bug given that the shows’ prices were raised instead of lowered as part of this “limited deal,” but still, it’s not a great look for Amazon, which just recently started focusing on podcasts.

The addition of podcasts is part of Audible’s latest push to sell subscriptions. The freely available shows add value to a costly subscription and bulk up its catalog, which might entice people to pay every month for access. It’s worth remembering, though, that most podcasts are available for free through RSS, not when you pay Audible.","['Ashley Carman', 'Jan']",https://news.google.com,high
iPhone 12 Mini Sales Lackluster Compared to Other Models,"Apple's 5.4-inch iPhone 12 mini, which is the smallest iPhone that has been released since the 2016 iPhone SE, may not be selling as well as Apple hoped. According to new sales numbers from Consumer Intelligence Research Partners, the ‌iPhone 12 mini‌ accounted for a lower number of sales than other iPhone 12 models that Apple offers.



Combined, all new ‌iPhone 12‌ models accounted for 76 percent of ‌iPhone‌ sales in the United States in October and November. The standard ‌iPhone 12‌ was the best selling model, accounting for 27 percent of those sales.

‌iPhone 12 mini‌ sales made up just six percent of the total ‌iPhone 12‌ sales during the launch period, while the iPhone 12 Pro and Pro Max had sales numbers closer to the ‌iPhone 12‌.

‌iPhone 12‌ models garnered a significant share at launch, but with mixed results, as ‌iPhone 12 mini‌ seems to have been lost among the other models,"" said Josh Lowitz, CIRP Partner and Co-Founder. ""Apple not only launched a wider range of new models than ever before, and also divided that launch into two pairs of models, so comparison to earlier launches is tricky. In addition, Apple launched a new ‌iPhone SE‌ earlier in the year, further complicating the lineup.

Last year's iPhone 11 models accounted for 69 percent of sales in the period after their launch, so the ‌iPhone 12‌ models did better overall. In 2019, the ‌iPhone 11‌ was the best-selling ‌iPhone‌, accounting for 39 percent of sales, with the 11 Pro and Pro Max making up the remaining 30 percent.

Compared to last year's launch of ‌iPhone 11‌, which accounted for 69% of sales in the period after the launch, the four ‌iPhone 12‌ models did even better, with 76% of sales. However, there was no clear leader among the new models, with sales evenly distributed among ‌iPhone 12‌, 12 Pro, and 12 Max. In contrast, in 2019, ‌iPhone 11‌ had an incredible 39% of sales, with ‌iPhone 11‌ Pro and Pro Max combining for only 30% of sales.

CIRP speculates that the availability of lower-cost models like the $399 ‌iPhone SE‌, $499 iPhone XR, and $599 ‌iPhone 11‌, may have ultimately limited the appeal of the more expensive ‌iPhone 12 mini‌, which is priced at $699.","['Juli Clover', 'Hartley Charlton', 'Joe Rossignol', 'Frank Mcshan', 'Tim Hardwick']",https://news.google.com,high
Jeff Bezos just named a huge rocket recovery ship after his mom,"New York (CNN) It's always a challenge to find the right gift to get one's mother, the right token that accurately reflects the appreciation and affection you feel towards the woman that birthed you. If you are Jeff Bezos, the world's richest man, deep pockets enable you to name a giant rocket recovery ship after her.

In perhaps the ultimate gift, Jeff Bezos surprised his mother, Jacklyn Bezos, by unveiling the name of the rocket-catching recovery boat for his space company Blue Origin, calling it the Jacklyn in her honor. While the 600-foot ship was purchased back in 2018, it has since been refurbished, and now renamed, for its new post as a floating landing zone for the first stage of Blue Origin's upcoming heavy lift rocket, known as the New Glenn.

Bezos spread the news by posting video of his mother christening the boat with champagne to his Instagram.

The Jacklyn is necessary because New Glenn's first stage is reusable. In fact, the rocket's first stage is designed to be reused up to 25 times. Much like how SpaceX's drone recovery ships Of Course I Still Love You and Just Read the Instructions work to recover that company's Falcon 9 boosters, Jacklyn will be positioned in the Atlantic Ocean so that New Glenn's first stage booster can land on the boat when the rockets start launching from Kennedy Space Center later this year, if all goes to plan.",['Rachel Crane'],https://news.google.com,high

'Genshin Impact' Xiao Banner: 7 items to farm before the 1.3 update,"Genshin Impact is rapidly expanding. Every six weeks Genshin Impact receives a major update. The next update, Genshin Impact version 1.3, is launching in February, bringing new characters like Xiao to the mix. Before that happens, you can farm a few items to prepare for Xiao's arrival. Using the current Closed Beta test server, we know the current plans for what Xiao will need to increase his Ascension and Talent levels.

Here are seven items that you need to farm before Xiao arrives.

What are Xiao's upgrade items in Genshin Impact?

According to a recently updated Reddit graphic, upgrading Xiao's talents requires ""Prosperity"" talent books, Slimed-themed items, three Crowns of Insight, and Shadow of the Warrior. Meanwhile, to ascend Xiao and unlock his level caps, you'll need a mix of Vayuda Turquoise, Juvenile Jade (or Hurricane Seeds, depending on how the update pans out), Qingxin, and again Slime-themed items.

Upgrade materials needed for Xiao. u/Deviltakoyaki / MiHoYo

It's time to start acquiring your resources before Xiao actually appears.

Don't forget that you can combine excess materials at alchemic Crafting Benches in Liyue Harbor and Mondstadt. The effectiveness of crafting can be increased using either Sucrose or Xingqiu, the former of which is currently available in the Albedo banner.

Where can you farm ""Prosperity"" talent books in Genshin Impact?

You're going to need many ""Prosperity"" series talent books to max out Xiao's talents.

This series consists of Teachings of ""Prosperity,"" Guide to ""Prosperity,"" and Philosophies of ""Prosperity."" All three can be obtained as drops from the Taishan Mansion domain located by Jueyun Karst in Liyue. You need to hit Adventure Rank 26 to access the domain and you need to visit the mansion on Monday or Thursday or Sunday to secure the drops.

For specific numbers, Xiao requires nine Teachings of ""Prosperity,"" 63 Guide to ""Prosperity,"" and 114 Philosophies of ""Prosperity.""

Where can you farm the Crown of Insight in Genshin Impact?

A Crown of Insight is required to max out every single late level talent in Genshin Impact. Xiao is no exception. Unlike the other things on this list, you cannot farm the Crown of Insight at a controlled pace. It's primarily acquired through events like Unreconciled Stars and Chalk Prince and the Dragon, which both rewarded one Crown of Insight. You can also obtain one by upgrading the Frostbearing Tree in Dragonspine to level 11.

Luckily, Xiao only needs one Crown per talent. It's best to focus on upgrading the talents that you think you rely on the most.

Where can you farm Shadow of the Warrior in Genshin Impact?

Xiao needs 18 Shadow of the Warrior to max out his talents. This begins being required at Talent level 6. You can acquire Shadow of the Warrior by defeating Tartaglia in the Enter the Golden House Trounce Domain when set to level 70 or higher.

The domain becomes available after completing Chapter 1, Act 3: ""A New Star Approaches."" You can challenge the domain once per week with the reset occurring on Monday at 4 a.m. Eastern.

How can you farm Slime in Genshin Impact?

Xiao requires Slime Condensate, Slime Secretions, and Slime Concentrate throughout leveling up his character. These are necessities in both increasing his talent level and ascending his level cap.

All three items are found by killing slimes. Slime Condensate is dropped by any slain slime; Slime Secretions are dropped by level 40 and up slimes; Slime Concentrate is dropped by slimes that are level 60 and higher.

A great place to farm Slime items of all sorts can be found directly below a cliff facing the Guyun Stone Forest in Liyue. If you drop into the watery area, you'll find a small Slime squadron.

Slimes can also be found as enemies in Daily Quests or during Leyline Outcroppings. Both have a high chance to spawn Slimes.

If you're trying to max out Xiao's talents, you'll need 18 Slime Condensates, 66 Slime Secretions, and 93 Slime Concentrates. On the other hand, if you want to push Xiao to his highest level, you'll need 18 Slime Condensates, 30 Slime Secretions, and 36 Slime Concentrates.

This means you've gotta try farming a total of 36 Slime Condensates, 96 Slime Secretions, and 123 Slime Concentrates. That's enough Slime to launch a show on Nickelodeon.

Where can you farm Qingxin in Genshin Impact?

As one of the esteemed Adepti, of course, Xiao is hankering for some Qingxin to max out his level. He needs 168 Qingxin flowers to reach his highest Ascension level. You can find these floral goodies in a few separate places. You can purchase them in sets of 10 at Bubu Pharmacy. The inventory will be restocked every three days.

If you'd like to locate them in the wild, Huaguang Stone Forest and Jueyun Karst are particularly bountiful locations. Specifically, check mountaintops to find the flower. You can also find Qingxin in high supply atop the mountains by Qingce Village.

Where can you farm Vayuda Turquoise, Juvenile Jade (or Hurricane Seeds) in Genshin Impact?

Xiao is an Anemo character, meaning he needs a ton of Vayuda Turquoise for Ascensions. You can farm these items by defeating Anemo Hypostasises in Mondstadt. Vayuda Turquoise can also be purchased in small sums from souvenir shops in Liyue and Mondstadt. Xiao requires one sliver, nine fragments, nine chunks, and six gemstones.

Traditionally, Xiao, like other Anemo characters would require Hurricane Seeds, but miHoYo seemingly has other plans for the character. Hurricane Seeds were originally the upgrade material that he used in the closed beta. In recent updates, however, his final Ascension material has shifted to Juvenile Jade, an item that can only be acquired by defeating the new boss, the Ancient Geovishap. This boss will be added in version 1.3, making it impossible to farm right now.

This is likely a permanent change for Xiao. Luckily, if he does revert to Hurricane Seeds, you'll gain those as you defeat Anemo Hyposasises for Vayuda Turquoise.",[],https://news.google.com,high

A new app allows teachers to use their iPhone or iPad as an overhead camera on Zoom,"Teachers who have found themselves holding class over Zoom have probably already figured out clever hacks to show their students documents, but there’s now an app designed specifically for that purpose (via 9to5Mac). Overviewer was made by developer Charlie Chapman, and it allows teachers (or anyone, really) to easily use their phone’s camera as a replacement for an overhead document viewer.

If it’s been a minute since you were a student, or if your school didn’t have these overhead devices, they’re basically webcams pointing straight down that allow teachers to show students a printed document, book, hand drawing, or other piece of writing or image. It’s a useful ability to have, but many teachers are working from home because of COVID and may not have access to one like they would in the classroom.

Overviewer works as a replacement by taking advantage of Zoom’s built-in screen sharing feature that works with the iPhone when its connected to a computer with a Lightning cable, or wirelessly through AirPlay (at the moment, it doesn’t seem like Zoom offers this feature for Android users). It shows a feed from your phone’s camera on the screen, with nothing else getting in the way. The feature also offers the ability to turn your phone’s flashlight on if your lighting situation isn’t ideal, as well as the option to change which camera is being displayed.

In a heartwarming blog post about how he developed the app for his wife, who works as a kindergarten teacher, Chapman explains how he saw his wife using iOS’s built-in camera app to do the same thing, and how she was frustrated by the lack of landscape support and all the buttons overlaid on-screen:

So being the dorky husband that I am, I quickly built an app that does nothing other than show what the phone camera sees with zero chrome, and properly rotates the whole app so that you can share it in landscape on zoom. This did the trick and she actually used it! It’s pretty tailor made for exactly my wife’s use case but I would think that would be a pretty common one for teachers to be in right now in our current virtual teaching world.

If you’re a teacher, or are thinking of some other use for the app, it’s available for free on the App Store. It’s worth noting that if you’re using a Mac, Zoom will ask for permission to record your screen and have to be restarted in order to share your phone’s screen (this is because Zoom is just displaying your phone’s screen on your computer, and then capturing that window).

For more information on how the app works, the developer has made a how-to video, which you can watch below.","['Mitchell Clark', 'Jan']",https://news.google.com,high
Call of Duty Warzone nerfs for the DMR 14 and Mac 10 have arrived,"If you’ve been playing Warzone lately, you’re well aware of the DMR 14-dominated meta – the battle royale game has been completely taken over by the weapon, which takes at most two shots to kill most opponents. Hearing fans’ complaints, Call of Duty: Black Ops – Cold War developer Raven Software has rolled out an update to nerf some of the FPS game’s most annoyingly OP weapons.

“Don’t fret! We’ve heard you and a balance update is coming soon to address concerns about the DMR 14, Type 63, Mac 10, and dual pistols,” Raven tweeted Tuesday, which should come as a major relief to Warzone players who prefer to use weapons other than the designated marksman rifle.

Warzone’s subreddit has been awash in complaints about the DMR for the last while, complete with videos showing off its meta-busting power in action. In fact, the subreddit now has moved on to highlighting posts that show amazing counter-DMR plays – but the comments all tend to devolve into complaints about the unbalanced state of the game resulting from the rifle’s unique advantages.

Today, Raven says the update is now live, and it contains some much needed power reductions for the OP weapons.

Here’s the official tweet:

The time has come. 📄#Warzone update going live: – DMR 14 – Reduced headshot damage, increased recoil

– Type 63 – Reduced headshot damage, increased recoil

– Mac-10 – Decreased headshot multiplier

– Dual pistols – Increased hip fire spread, decreased damage range — Raven Software (@RavenSoftware) January 6, 2021

Of course, players will also be happy to learn that other new Call of Duty: Black Ops – Cold War weapons like the Mac 10 are getting nerfed, along with the Type 63 assault rifle and dual pistols.","['Ian Boudreau', 'Senior News Writer', 'Former Military Public Affairs Specialist.

"Discovery+ Needs to Be Part of Your Streaming Life, It's That Good","Photo : Catie Keck/Gizmodo

Discovery’s new streaming service has finally arrived.



The company’s official entrance into the streaming wars brought all of Discovery’s assets under a single roof, with everything from true crime to reality TV to nature documentaries. Discovery+ is home to tens of thousands of episodes from legacy broadcast channels like HGTV, the History Channel, A&E, Food Network, and more. And it’s not just old stuff, either—Discovery says it plans to bring more than 1,000 hours of original content to the platform in its first year, with more than 50 exclusives available on the service at launch. That’s a fairly good haul of content to offer potential subscribers right out of the gate.

But the service charges for both its ad-supported and ad-free tiers, which cost $5 and $7 per month, respectively. Do you really need to add another paid streaming service to your portfolio, particularly when so many others launched last year? Maybe not. But I’d encourage anyone to give Discovery+ a shot before writing it off. Not only were its natural world originals and exclusives a huge draw for me, personally—as well as all you other David Attenborough heads out there—but Discovery+ delivered an excellent product at launch that will, at the very least, introduce something new to your limited premium content options.

Services Services Discovery+ Discovery+ What is it? A new streaming service that brings all of Discovery's brands under one roof, as well as some licensed content. Price $5/month with ads, $7/month to go ad-free Like The sheer volume of its library—there's something here for everyone. Dislike Content in 4K is a little light and tricky to find.

Now, I’m not sure what your own quarantine content diet has been like, but I’ve survived mostly on mindless reality TV binge-watching (I know, I know) and a lot of documentaries about the natural world and space phenomena. I’ll watch it anywhere I can find it: Netflix, Apple TV, PBS, whatever. If this sounds like you, reader, I have some great news: Discovery+ is a smorgasbord of exactly this kind of thing, thanks to both Discovery’s own assets and exclusive BBC programming, which includes Planet Earth, Blue Planet, Serengeti, and The Mating Game. Attenborough also narrates the Discovery+ original A Perfect Planet, a five-part series from the same folks behind Planet Earth. This alone should be reason enough to at least activate one of multiple free trial offers the service is currently running.



But that’s not everything. I was honestly surprised by how much variety was represented on launch day and how easy it was to find stuff to watch by genre or channel. Homepage rows make finding new originals, featured content, trending series, and your personalized watch list easy. I do wish the service made finding 4K content a little easier. Right now, 4K is limited to a handful of natural world series like Blue Planet II and Planet Earth II on platforms that support it. But we should expect to see more 4K content hit the service eventually—potentially even this year.

In terms of support, Discovery+ had a refreshingly smooth rollout on most major platforms, including Xbox, Fire TV, Roku, Apple, Android, Samsung smart TVs, and Chromecast, including its latest version with Google TV. I am currently testing a Vizio OLED TV, and while I wasn’t able to open the app on the TV itself, I was able to cast Discovery+ to the TV from my iPhone 11. I asked Discovery whether it planned to add support to other smart TVs running proprietary software, including LG and Vizio, and while the company didn’t have anything immediate to share, it sounds like Discovery is working on expanded support.

Each of Discovery’s brands and partners has its own bubble in a slider on the homepage, in addition to categories like lifestyle, adventure and exploration, paranormal and unexplained, documentaries, as well as science and technology, among others. It was immediately clear to me that rather than simply smashing a bunch of seemingly unaffiliated brands together and hoping it works (cough HBO Max cough), Discovery put a lot of thought into organization and design. It just works.



Now, you may be wondering how, with tens of thousands of episodes available at launch, Discovery sorts through all of its various brands and titles to serve you something to watch. The company uses its own proprietary algorithm that takes a number of factors about your watch habits into consideration, and while it does consider page views, the company wouldn’t comment on specifically how its system works. But as far as user-specific content recommendations go, it does help that Discovery+ made user profiles available immediately. Five profiles are supported per account, and the service allows for up to four concurrent streams. That means that one subscription could cover just about everyone in an average household.

And as for its originals? You’ll probably know before you subscribe whether you’re a Chip and Joanna Gaines superfan—and there must be many because Discovery leans into this marital enterprise very hard—or the kind of tinfoil hat-wearing dork who’ll tune in for a new Project Blue Book series (it me). But I was pleasantly surprised at the number of titles I’ll definitely be adding to the watch list that I so desperately need to get me through what’s left of winter. (I am hesitant to admit that these titles include a paranormal joint called Amityville Horror House, but listen, we’re all doing our best right now.)

Discovery+ isn’t going to replace your Netflix subscription, and Discovery’s own leadership has said as much. But Discovery+ is, as CEO David Zaslav described it recently, a “perfect complement” to your primary portfolio of cordcutting solutions. And who knows! It may just surprise you. As streaming launches go, this one is thoughtfully exceptional.

Windows 7 is still running on at least 100 million PCs,"Windows 7 appears to still be running on at least 100 million machines, despite Microsoft ending support for the operating system a year ago. ZDNet has been analyzing the proportion of PCs still running Windows 7 across various analytics reports. While each data source pegs Windows 7 at different percentages of market share, most agree that the OS still makes up for around 20 percent of PCs.

Microsoft has said for years that there are 1.5 billion users of Windows across multiple versions worldwide. It’s difficult to get an exact number of Windows 7 users owing to the different methods used by analytics companies, but it’s at least 100 million. If you drop Microsoft’s estimate of 1.5 billion users of Windows to just a billion (there are 1 billion active Windows 10 users), then Windows 7 is still on a massive amount of PCs. In reality, it could still be in use by more than 200 million devices worldwide.

Support for Windows 7 ended in January 2020, nearly 11 years after the OS first launched with its “I’m a PC, and Windows 7 was my idea” marketing campaign. It quickly became a massively popular version of Windows, especially with businesses. It was clear from looking at the market share of the operating system last year that it would take a year or two to get Windows 7 firmly below 10 percent market share.

It may take even longer for Windows 7 to finally disappear, especially after a year when many have turned to PCs for remote working and home schooling. Microsoft reported an increase in PC demand and usage due to the pandemic. It’s likely that part of that PC usage also came from households dusting off old PCs and laptops they haven’t used frequently, and some of these devices could still be running Windows 7.

It’s clear that the pandemic has also influenced the PC market over the past year. We’re still waiting on PC estimates from Gartner and IDC, but some analysts believe we could have seen nearly 300 million PCs shipped in 2020 alone. That would be a significant change for the PC market, after PCs saw a first year of growth since 2011 during 2019. That growth was boosted by the end of Windows 7 support, and most analysts didn’t expect the market to grow even further throughout 2020.","['Tom Warren', 'Jan']",https://news.google.com,high

OnePlus Breaks Into Budget Phones With OnePlus Nord N Series,"Over the past several years, OnePlus has grown from a beloved niche brand to a powerhouse in the US market. Its strategy is simple: sell flagship smartphones at affordable prices. Last year, the company announced its first midrange offerings, the OnePlus Nord and OnePlus Nord N10 5G. And while neither made it to the US in 2020, OnePlus is now making good on its promise to bring the Nord N10 5G to the US along with its first budget phone, the Nord N100.

The OnePlus Nord N10 5G and OnePlus Nord N100 will be available at T-Mobile, Metro by T-Mobile, and on the OnePlus website later this month. Both offer serious hardware at rock-bottom prices, which puts them up against the likes of the Motorola Moto G Power.

With a 6.49-inch display and 90Hz refresh rate, the $300 Nord N10 5G is the more expensive and feature-rich of the pair. It’s powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 690 chipset, and sports 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. And if the name didn’t give it away, it also works on T-Mobile’s 5G network.

There’s a chunky 4,300mAh battery that should easily get heavy users through a full day between charges. But if you find yourself running low, OnePlus includes a 30W Warp charger in the box. A quick 10-minute charge will easily add several hours of juice to a depleted battery.

(The OnePlus Nord N10 5G features a quad camera stack.)

On the back of the phone, you’ll find a fingerprint sensor along with a quad camera stack with a 64MP primary lens, 8MP ultrawide lens, and 2MP depth and macro lenses. A 16MP selfie shooter is on the front.

OnePlus Nord N100

If you’re not worried about 5G or simply want to save a little money, the OnePlus Nord N100 is worth a look. It’s a pared-down version of Nord N10 5G that clocks in under $200. It features a 6.52-inch display, stereo speakers, and a massive 5,000mAh battery with 18W fast charging.

The phone sports a Qualcomm Snapdragon 460 processor, 4GB of RAM, and 64GB of storage. There’s a fingerprint sensor on the back of the phone, alongside a triple camera module with a 13MP main lens and 2MP depth and macro sensors. The front-facing camera clocks in at 8MP.

Both phones ship with Android 10 along with OnePlus’ OxygenOS 10.5 skin. It’s amongst our favorite Android skins and offers features like Zen Mode to help you step away from your phone, as well as a Black and White Mode for reading. There’s no word if either phone will get the Android 11 treatment in the coming months, but OnePlus tends to have an excellent track record with software upgrades.

The Nord duo will be available online and at T-Mobile and Metro by T-Mobile stores on Jan. 15 at 10 a.m. ET. The 5G-capable Nord N10 will set you back $299.99 while the Nord N100 will be available for $179.99. Pre-orders go live on Amazon, Best Buy, B&H, and OnePlus on Jan. 8 at 10 a.m. ET.

Nissan source code leaked online after Git repo misconfiguration,"Image: Daniel Demers

The source code of mobile apps and internal tools developed and used by Nissan North America has leaked online after the company misconfigured one of its Git servers.

The leak originated from a Git server that was left exposed on the internet with its default username and password combo of admin/admin, Tillie Kottmann, a Swiss-based software engineer, told ZDNet in an interview this week.

Kottmann, who learned of the leak from an anonymous source and analyzed the Nissan data on Monday, said the Git repository contained the source code of:

Nissan NA Mobile apps

some parts of the Nissan ASIST diagnostics tool

the Dealer Business Systems / Dealer Portal

Nissan internal core mobile library

""We are aware of a claim regarding a reported improper disclosure of Nissan's confidential information and source code. We take this type of matter seriously and are conducting an investigation,"" the Nissan rep told ZDNet in an email.

Loads Of Graphics Cards Just Got More Expensive,"Cards like this are either already more expensive or are about to be thanks to tariffs imposed as part of an ongoing trade dispute between the US and China. Image : ASUS

Last week, a range of products that had been exempted from tariffs—thanks to the ongoing US v China trade war—lost that status, and so in 2021 will be more expensive. Among those products are graphics cards and motherboards.



As the New York Times reported last week, “Mr. Trump began placing tariffs on more than $360 billion of Chinese goods in 2018, prompting thousands of companies to ask the administration for temporary waivers excluding them from the levies.”

Those waivers are now done, and PC hardware companies are among those who have already raised their prices to accommodate the tariffs. While this will affect most companies in this part of the industry, since so many components and products are sourced from China, ASUS are so far the only ones to issue a statement explaining the hikes, saying:

Update regarding MSRP pricing for ASUS components in 2021. This update applies to graphics cards and motherboards* We have an announcement in regards to MSRP price changes that are effective in early 2021 for our award-winning series of graphic cards and motherboards. Our new MSRP reflects increases in cost for components. operating costs, and logistical activities plus a continuation of import tariffs. We worked closely with our supply and logistic partners to minimize price increases. ASUS greatly appreciates your continued business and support as we navigate through this time of unprecedented market change. *additional models may see an increase as we moved further into Q1.

Advertisement

So what kind of price increases are we looking at? People who pay a lot closer attention to this stuff than I do have already found examples of cards getting more expensive, like ASUS’ RTX 3090 going from $1799 to $1979. The size of the tariffs themselves are “either an additional 7.5 percent or 25 percent tariff, depending on their product, ” but as you can see from that RTX 3090 price, companies aren’t passing the entire cost onto consumers; they’ll be looking to cut corners/absorb part of the hit themselves.

Aukey is offering a limited time deal on one of its wireless charging stands that has multiple coils, simultaneously supporting a phone (oriented vertically or horizontally) and, say, a set of wireless earbuds like AirPods or Galaxy Buds Live resting around the back of it. By clipping the on-page coupon that knocks 5 percent off the cost and applying the 35 percent of extra savings (click the “1 Applicable Promotion” drop-down to redeem), this charger drops down in price to just over $16 before tax.

A few things worth noting are that this wireless charger doesn’t include a power brick, so you’ll have to supply your own. Also, it tops out at 10W of charging speed for most Android phones, while iPhones (aside from the iPhone 12 mini since its coil doesn’t align properly, says Aukey) that support Qi charging will charge at 7.5W, and Pixel phones and AirPods max out at 5W. Basically, get this to keep your devices topped up throughout the day, not to quickly recharge things before leaving the house.

This deal lasts until January 12th at 2:59AM ET.

Visit Super Nintendo World without going to Japan,"Most of us probably won’t be able to travel to Japan for the opening of Universal Studios Japan’s Super Nintendo World, but there’s a second option for checking out the theme park: a digital walkthrough available on the Super Nintendo World website.

Sure, nothing will be as magical as the real thing, but the interactive map is our best look at the park yet. On the website, visitors are able to fly through the park, checking out different rides, like the Mario Kart Koopa’s Challenge and a Yoshi ride, called Yoshi’s Adventure. Everything is rendered in 3D, with looks at the different interactive elements at the park down to the food and gift shops.

You can see a full overhead view on the map below.

Nintendo shared details on its food and shopping options last year, but there are plenty more photos available now, including this burger with a very cute Mario hat. There’s also a mushroom pizza bowl with a dough cap, and a Question Block tiramisu. It’s a theme park, so you can also expect souvenir popcorn buckets — both in Mario Kart and Superstar styles.

We’ve also got a great look at the Power Up Bands that will partner with a smartphone app. Naturally, they’re also very cute, and designed to collect points as players “play” their way though the park. Alongside these bands, visitors to the park will also be able to meet Mario, Luigi, Princess Peach, and toads — and according to the website, people with Power Up Bands may have “more fun.” I don’t know what that means, but I am excited to — one day — find out.

Until then, it’s just me endlessly scrolling through the digital walkthrough.","['Nicole Carpenter', 'Austen Goslin', 'Matt Patches', 'Owen S. Good', 'Charlie Hall', 'Patricia Hernandez', 'Cass Marshall', 'Jan']",https://news.google.com,high
Apex Legends challenges you to a spot of boxing in its new event,"Meet me in the ring. Not the normal scary Apex Legends death ring though, the boxing ring! Respawn Entertainment are kicking off a new collection event for the battle royale this evening: Fight Night. It’s a new town takeover themed around the lovable murderbot Pathfinder, in which players will be stripped of their guns and face-off in fisticuffs. A new game mode is joining the fray too, as are lots of new cosmetics and a small army of robots you might recognise from the Titanfall games.

First up, Fight Night will place a giant boxing ring on the Olympus map. Players who jump into the ring will have their weapons and abilities disabled, so the only way to deal with enemies inside is to punch and kick for your life. Players outside of the boxing ring won’t be able to shoot in either, so once you’re in there the only threats are your opponents’ fists (or feet).

Given that Apex players have a bit of an affinity for boxing matches, I’m excited to see how well this goes. Some of the best fun I’ve had in this game involved matches ending in spontaneous fisticuffs.

Respawn are also experimenting with how they launch limited-time game modes now. The new one for Fight Night is called Airdrop Escalation. It’s essentially the same as a normal battle royale, except you’ll find loads more supply drops than usual. The twist is that rather than being on its own playlist, it’ll replace the normal battle royale mode for the duration of the event.

On top of all this, lots of loot MRVNs will be dotted around Olympus. These Titanfall 2 bots will drop loot if you give ’em a high five. You can tell what tier of loot they’re hoarding by what’s on their little chest screens (for example; a very happy yellow face means gold-tier stuff).

To go along with the event, a new animation in Apex Legends’ Stories From The Outlands series has been released, this time focussing on Pathfinder’s origins. It’s a film noir-style story complete with shady gangsters and flashbacks aplenty.

As with previous collection events, this one also comes with a load of pretty new cosmetics, most of which are themed around Pathy’s film-noir boxing scene.

Fight Night kicks off for us UK folks at 6pm GMT (10am PT) today. There are plenty of bug fixes, tweaks and quality of life changes coming in tonight’s patch too. Check out the website for more info.",['News Writer'],https://news.google.com,high
The Apple Products That Could Be Released In 2021,"TipRanks

It’s a new year, and a good time to choose new stock to line the portfolio. Investment banking giant Goldman Sachs has been watching the markets with an eye toward the long term – and a finger on pulse of the present. The firm is bullish following the passage of the COVID relief bill last month, seeing the direct income assistance of $600 per person – or $1200 for married couples – as a positive for consumers’ disposable income in the here-and-now.And with consumer spending making up some two-thirds of the US economy, and boost to that metric is seen as good for the whole. Taking the COVID relief checks into account, Goldman Sachs' chief economist, Jan Hatzius, raised his expectations for US economic growth in 1Q21 – bumping his GDP forecast from 3% to 5%.“While the income effects of the fiscal package will be very front-loaded, we expect the impact on consumer spending to be more evenly distributed throughout the year,” Hatzius noted. The economist sees current conditions – with lockdowns in place, as putting something of a damper on immediate spending, but leading to pent-up demand later in the year. With that in mind, Hatzius is predicting sequential gains in Q2 and Q3, and full-year GDP growth of 5.8%, up 9% from his previous estimate.The stock analysts at Goldman are keen to follow Hatzius’ lead, and they’ve been combing the market for stocks that are likely to gain as the markets take a long-term rising trajectory. The firm's analysts are pulling the trigger on two stocks in particular, noting that each has the potential to deliver double-digit gains in the year ahead. We ran the two through TipRanks’ database to see what other Wall Street's analysts have to say about them.17 Education & Technology (YQ)The worldwide pandemic had one effect that could never have been predicted in advance: the sudden shift of schools to mass online classes. Remote office work has been around for a long time, and at the secondary and college levels, schools have had long experience with correspondence courses – but mass online learning, even down to the primary level, had never been attempted. Companies like 17 Education, however, take up the challenge of online learning.17 Education is a Chinese company, dedicated to joining technology with high-quality educational content to create more effective and efficient tutoring services for K-12. The program includes both online and in-classroom solutions – 17 Education bills itself as a full-service educational technology provider.It is also a new company to the financial markets. YQ stock went public just this past December, when trading commenced on the 4th of the month. The IPO opened flat, with shares priced at $10.50, the midpoint of the pre-IPO range. By December 9, the share price had nearly doubled. Since then, however, the stock is down 34% from its peak.Among the bulls is Goldman analyst Christine Cho, who initiated her coverage of YQ with a Buy rating and a $21 price target. This figure indicates a 55% upside for the next 12 months. (To watch Cho’s track record, click here)Cho is bullish on the company’s application of big data systems to analyze and streamline classroom solutions, and sees its unique ‘hybrid’ model of combining in-school and online courses as a net plus. “We see [YQ] translating into two potential advantages for its AST [after school tutoring] business: (1) proprietary school-level insights enabling YQ to develop more localized/customized content, and (2) ability to grow paid enrollments rapidly at a low student acquisition cost — a key challenge in the online AST industry — through penetration of organic in-school MAUs…” The Goldman review is one of two on record for 17 Education; the other is also a Buy, making the consensus view a Moderate Buy. The stock is priced at $13.5, and the $20.50 average price target gives an upside potential of ~52%. (See YQ stock analysis on TipRanks)ChampionX Corporation (CHX)17 Education wasn’t the only new ticker to hit the markets at the height of the pandemic, rather, it was one of many. ChampionX is an oilfield technology company that conducted a major change in 1H20. It’s namesake, ChampionX Holdings, merged with Apergy Corp, with the combined company attaching the ChampionX name to the new partner’s trading history. CHX started trading in June 2020, and in December, the company moved its ticker from the NYSE to the NASDAQ.CHX offers a range of oilfield tech solutions, including such specialized applications as drilling fluid and mud additives, fracturing fluid systems, and well cementing, in addition to drilling technologies. These tech services are essential for the oil producers – that own the wells – to get the product to the surface. The essential nature of the service, plus the generally improving economic conditions, led to a Q3 sequential gain in revenues of 112%. The top line came in at $633 million.Analyst Angie Sedita, who covers this stock for Goldman, sees the company in an advantageous position.“We view ChampionX as a strong oilfield service and equipment provider with a global footprint and favorable product mix. Its primary businesses, chemicals and artificial lift, are exposed to the production phase of the life of a well, thus producing lower earnings cyclicality and stronger through-cycle EBITDA. The recent merger of the two companies completed in Q2-20 (Apergy and ChampionX) should drive market share growth and cross-selling opportunities both in the international and U.S. markets,” Sedita wrote.To this end, Sedita initiated coverage on CHX with a Buy rating and a $21 price target. Her target implies a 20% upside for the next 12 months. (To watch Sedita’s track record, click here)All in all, six of Wall Street’s analysts have reviews CHX shares, and 5 said to Buy against 1 who rated it a Hold. This puts the analyst consensus at a Strong Buy. However, the recent share appreciation has pushed the stock price above the average price target of $17.10.

"Apple Researching Wireless Charging Ecosystem for MacBook, iPad, iPhone, and Apple Watch","Apple is researching the integration of multiple inductive charging coils into MacBooks and iPads to use them as wireless chargers for other devices, according to a patent filed by Apple.

The patent, spotted by Patently Apple, is titled ""Inductive charging between electronic devices"" and was awarded by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.

Apple has been researching device-to-device inductive charging technology since March 2016, when the now-granted patents around it were first filed. It is notable that Apple seems to be particularly interested in this area, filing for multiple patents relating to the technology, and it has now applied for 40 new claims.

This patent highlights how all mobile Apple devices, including Apple Watches, iPhones, iPads, and MacBooks, could use an ecosystem of wireless charging together. Images included in the patent present a significant number of different coil placements for a range of portable Apple devices to facilitate this system.

Apple presents a wide variety of possible implementations for device-to-device wireless charging. For example, the lid of a MacBook could contain a series of upward-facing inductive coils, allowing devices to charge by being rested on top of it. Coils could also be placed on the palm rests and trackpad of a MacBook.

Crucially, the wireless charging system is two-way, with devices able to both receive and transmit power via inductive coils, allowing users to choose which device is charged. It may also be determined automatically by software based on which device has a greater amount of charge.

Apple's proposed strategy seems to be to incorporate carefully-positioned inductive charging coils on every mobile Apple device. For example, the patent explains how coils could be placed along both the front and back of an iPad, allowing it to be wirelessly charged from one side while transmitting charge to another device on the other side. The proposed system is heavily interchangeable as a result, with a huge number of device combinations and placements possible.

There is even the suggestion that a collection of Apple devices could be charged together from one power source. An image depicts an Apple Watch charging from an iPhone, the ‌iPhone‌ from an ‌iPad‌, the ‌iPad‌ from a MacBook, and the MacBook from a power cable. Text accompanying the image states ""only a single power cord or no power cords may be needed to charge one or more of a group of devices that include electrically communicative inductive coils.""

Apple has also considered an assortment of software integrations for the device-to-device wireless charging system. When a smaller device is placed on the display of a larger device, such as an Apple Watch on the front of an ‌iPad‌, the ‌iPad‌'s display could indicate its ""alignment condition"" and charge percentage.

Another more inventive software integration proposes that, if the screen of an ‌iPad‌ is obstructed by charging an ‌iPhone‌ on it, the ‌iPad‌'s UI could adjust to only display content on the unobstructed part of the screen. There are also provisions for scenarios in which the ‌iPhone‌ could be used to display the content that has been obstructed on the ‌iPad‌'s screen, such as a row of home screen apps.

The patent also repeatedly refers to a system of magnets that could be used to align devices to each other for charging, which seems to be strikingly similar to Apple's MagSafe system which premiered with the iPhone 12 lineup.

In some embodiments, the electronic device includes an alignment magnet that is positioned adjacent the inductive coil. The alignment magnet may be configured to assist in positioning the external device relative to the electronic device...

The patent implies that this magnetic alignment system could be used on any of its portable devices to support a better experience when charging wirelessly, and it would certainly make sense to expand ‌MagSafe‌ or a MagSafe-like system to more devices to support this ecosystem of device-to-device inductive charging. ‌MagSafe‌ is only available on the ‌iPhone 12‌ and iPhone 12 Pro at present.

Should Apple integrate the proposed technology, it would create a unified system of wireless charging across all portable Apple devices. The device-to-device inductive charging system seems feasible and would help Apple to synthesize its otherwise fragmented range of charging methods, but it is not clear how Apple would address the inevitable thermal, penetration, or efficiency issues it would cause.

The arrival of ‌MagSafe‌ charging on the ‌iPhone 12‌ demonstrates Apple's interest in wireless charging solutions, and the depth of the company's research shows how thoroughly such systems are being considered. In spite of this, patents can only serve as proof of what Apple is researching. They do not necessarily indicate what the company may implement and the contents of many patents never reach final consumer products.","['Hartley Charlton', 'Joe Rossignol', 'Frank Mcshan', 'Tim Hardwick']",https://news.google.com,high
Qualcomm's Snapdragon 480 SoC to bring 5G to low-cost phones,"Credit: Pixabay/CC0 Public Domain

As 5G-enabled phones secured their spot as major players in smartphone technology in 2020, access to this latest functionality has been limited to higher-end phones. But things are about to change, as Qualcomm announced today the development of the Snapdragon 480 5G Mobile Platform, which is expected to usher in a new wave of low-cost smartphones featuring cutting-edge features of the latest wireless standard.

5G technology promises higher peak data speeds, very low latency and greater reliability. With the current crop of 5G-enabled phones hovering above $500, the extension of 5G to Qualcomm's 4-series SoC could pave the way for smartphones priced in the $125-to-$250 range.

The Snapdragon 480 chipset incorporates an X51 modem that supports mmWave and below-6-GHz bandwidths, which ensures compatibility with nearly all 5G networks available today. 5G is not available everywhere, but users in regions offering the technology will see download speeds of 2.5 Gbps and upload speeds up to 660 Mbps.

Qualcomm says the new 400-series processor will offer key improvements over the previous generation. The Snapdragon 480 should double the speed performance of its predecessor, the Snapdragon 460. Qualcomm credits its 8-nm manufacturing process, along with new CPU and GPU elements for the improvement. Qualcomm says AI tasks will see a 70% improvement over the previous generation.

It will also offer 64-megapixel images and the capacity to capture photos from each of three onboard cameras simultaneously. Three 720p videos can also be captured at the same time.

Other features of the 480 include Bluetooth 5.1 and adoption of Charge 4+ standard that will offer better charging-speeds in new phones.

Announcement of manufacturers using the new processor will be made in the coming months. Vivo, Oppo, Xiaomi, Motorola and Nokia are expected to be among the early adopters.

In a statement released Monday, Kedar Kondap, vice president, product management at Qualcomm Technologies, said, ""Qualcomm Technologies continues to accelerate 5G commercialization globally to make 5G smartphones more accessible, especially as people worldwide continue to connect remotely. The Snapdragon 480 5G Mobile Platform will exceed OEM's and consumer's expectations in delivering high- and mid-tier features at an affordable price.""

Qualcomm led the introduction of 5G technology with a series of platforms introduced early last year. Those platforms included the Snapdragon 854, 765, 750G and 690. Its new flagship Snapdragon 888 is due to be unveiled later this month.

Today's announcement is just the opening salvo of what promises to be year filled with improved and innovative features in a tech filed expanding at explosive pace. According to Review 42, a website devoted to tech enthusiasts, there are 5.11 billion mobile phone users globally tapping, swiping and clicking their phones an average of 2,617 times a day. Worldwide, they say, more people own cellphones than toothbrushes, and they check those phones more than 50 times a day.

In addition to faster and cheaper 5G smartphones in 2021, the new year also promises devices with faster displays, with refresh rates up to 120Hz and 144Hz; under-display cameras to avoid the unsightly lens bumps populating so many phones today; higher resolution video, up to 8K video capture; and more AR and VR functionality.

"Rumor: Entry-level iPad to adopt iPad Air 3 design, no design changes for 2021 iPad Pro","A new report from the supply chain outlet Macotakara today sheds more light on what to expect from the iPad lineup in 2021. According to the report, the 9th generation entry-level iPad will adopt a design similar to the iPad Air 3. There are also reportedly no design changes in store for the iPad Pro.

Apple introduced an all-new fourth-generation iPad Air last year featuring a design similar to the iPad Pro. Today’s report, however, says the entry-level iPad introduced in 2021 will feature a design similar to the third-generation iPad Air, which was originally introduced in 2019.

The new 9th generation iPad would purportedly feature the same 10.2-inch display as the 8th generation but would be significantly thinner and lighter:

According to a Chinese supplier, the next iPad (9th Generation) is likely to be based on the iPad Air (3rd Generation). The display size will remain the same as the iPad (8th Generation) at 10.2 inches, but the thickness will be much thinner at 6.3mm and the weight will be reduced to 460g. Sources say it will continue to use Touch ID, Lightning ports, Full-Lamination Displays, Anti-reflective Coating, P3 Displays, and True Tone Display.

As for the iPad Pro refresh we expect this year, Macotakara says the physical design will remain the same, but that the performance of the A-series processor inside “may be significantly improved.” The report makes no mention of the iPad Pro’s rumored transition to mini LED display technology.

The timeline for the release of the new 9th generation iPad is unclear, but given that the 8th generation model was only introduced last fall, we wouldn’t expect any updates until fall of this year at the earliest. On the flip side, other reports have indicated that the iPad Pro could be updated as soon as sometime this quarter.

Google Explains What URL Removals Tool Does,"Google’s John Mueller answered a tweet about the URL Removal Tool and why it wasn’t working how it was expected to. The question was in the context of a site that was hacked and generated Japanese spam pages.

Google Search Results Show Hacked Pages

One of the most frustrating things to happen to a site is to get hacked. The frustration is compounded when Google shows non-existent spam URLs in the search results.

That scenario is exactly what the person who asked the question was dealing with. They tried using Google’s URL Removal Tool but it seemed to not have the expected and desired effect.

According to the person asking the question:

“A website gets attacked “Japanese Spam”, the owner cleans the code, optimizes and secures the website but search results will take their own time to offer neat results.”

They next described the problem:

“Even after removing URL’S from SERP through Search console, the URL’s tend to come back to the search results or remain in index though as 404 pages. Why is Google getting those 404 pages back in index after removing them?”

How Google’s URL Removal Tool Works

The person asking the question was puzzled as to why the URLs remained in Google’s Search Index. It’s a common perception that using the URL Removal Tool will remove the URL from the SERPs and the index.

But that’s not what is actually happening.

John Mueller responded via Twitter:

“The URL removal tool in Search Console just temporarily hides pages from the search results, it doesn’t remove anything from the index.

Sometimes these pages take a while to be reindexed (& usually those are less-frequently shown in search anyway, so few people see it).”

Sometimes these pages take a while to be reindexed (& usually those are less-frequently shown in search anyway, so few people see it). — 🍌 John 🍌 (@JohnMu) January 5, 2021

Google Search Console Help: URL Removals Tool

Google’s Webmaster Support page for the URL Removals Tool very clearly says that the tool results in a temporary removal. The word “temporarily” is used eleven times on the page, making it clear that the effect is not permanent.

The page says:

“The Removals tool enables you to temporarily block pages from Google Search results on sites that you own.”

Further down the page it says that the tool is effective for stopping a URL from appearing in the search results.

“Follow this procedure to temporarily block a URL from appearing in Google Search results.”

In a way it’s a little confusing to call the tool a Removal Tool since the word “removal” has a sense of permanence.

The definition of the word “removal” is:

“The action of taking away or abolishing something unwanted.”

That definition does not make allowances for the temporariness of the removal.

But the fact is that the effect of the tool is only temporary.

"Xiaomi Mi 10i takes on the OnePlus Nord, offering quite more bang for your buck","Xiaomi has a bad habit of re-releasing slightly different variants of extremely similar phones for different markets, and it looks like the Redmi Note 9 Pro 5G is the latest device in for this treatment. Today, the company revealed a strikingly similar Mi 10i tailored for the Indian market, coming with a 108MP primary camera, a 6.67-inch display, and the Snapdragon 750G.

Like many Xiaomi phones, the Mi 10i offers great hardware at a low price, starting at only starting at ₹20,099 (~$275). The handset comes with a 120Hz 6.67-inch 1080p LCD screen protected by Gorilla Glass 5 that takes up almost all of the phone's front, though there is a notable chin on the bottom. The front-facing 16MP camera lives in the top middle of the display. On the back, you'll find a camera array consisting of four lenses in the top middle, arranged on a circular bump. It's comprised of the headlining 108MP camera, an 8MP ultra-wide, a 2MP macro, and a 2MP depth sensor.

The Mi 10i is powered by a Snapdragon 750G, which offers some notable AI improvements over its predecessors and better performance. A 4820mAh battery should provide the phone with enough energy for a day, and it supports 33W fast-charging, which allows it to go from zero to 100% in under an hour according to Xiaomi's measurements. There's also liquid cooling on board to take some strain off the battery and the processor. Three storage configurations are available: 6GB of RAM and 64GB of storage, 6GB+128GB, and 8GB+128GB.

Specs Display 120Hz 6.67"" DotDisplay, 2400 x 1080 FHD+, HDR and HDR10+, 450 nits, Corning Gorilla Glass 5 Software MIUI 12 CPU Snapdragon 750G RAM & Storage 6GB+64GB, 6GB+128GB, 8GB+128GB, LPDDR4x, UFS2.2 with Writebooster

6GB+128GB: ₹21,999 (~$300)

8GB+128GB: ₹23,999 (~$325)

Compared to many competitors, the Mi 10i has quite an array of great-to-haves: dual stereo speakers, a headphone jack, a side-mounted fingerprint reader, an IR blaster, expandable storage, and an IP53 certification. It's just a bummer that the pre-installed MIUI 12 is still based on Android 10, so let's hope it won't take long to update the phone to the latest release.

Xiaomi says the Mi 10i will get a hands-free experience for multiple voice assistants simultaneously via an OTA update post-launch, which could certainly turn out to be interesting. As for the ""i for India"" branding, Xiaomi boasts that the phone is the first to launch with the new GPS alternative NavIC, which should allow for more accurate positioning and faster location lock-ins in the country.

The Mi 10i will only be available in India, starting at ₹20,099 (~$275) for the 6GB+64GB variant and maxing out at ₹23,999 (~$325) for the 8GB+128GB version — undercutting the OnePlus Nord, which starts at ₹24,999 in India. The Mi 10i comes in three colors: Atlantic Blue, Midnight Black, and Pacific Sunrise.

Cyberpunk 2077 modders are fixing up the game,"Cyberpunk 2077 launched full of issues both big and small, but the mod community settled down and went to work. The game’s Nexus Mods page is now full of interesting additions that smooth the path through the base game’s bumpy ride.

For instance, players noticed after launch that Night City has no barbers. But thanks to a mod by homes432 called Arasaka Appearance Updater, the player can adjust some facial features and switch their haircut.

Another mod that is incredibly helpful is Better Minimap, by WillyJL. In standard Cyberpunk 2077, every time V gets out of their car, the camera zooms way in on the minimap, meaning you can’t see the objective that got you out of your car in the first place. Better Minimap offers new zoom options and other features.

There’s even a new mod that offers a third-person camera. Jelle Bekkar posted TPP Mod WIP Third Person on NexusMods, which allows the player to toggle through four different camera options.

The mods above have issues; some are marked as WIP (work in progress), or the author notes they have minor issues with lag or flickering visuals. But they’re also a very impressive effort at patching up a game that wasn’t ready for prime time.

CD Projekt Red announced an online mode and post-launch DLC before the game’s release, but it is currently unclear if those plans have changed after Cyberpunk 2077’s troubled launch on Dec. 10.

Onkyo and Pioneer's 2021 receivers offer 8K video and 2-way Bluetooth,"Onkyo

CES

After taking a year off, Pioneer and Onkyo return to CES with brand-new receivers for 2021, offering up-to-date features including 8K video and Dolby Atmos.

All the AV receivers have HDMI 2.1 compatibility -- with 8K video and gaming features such as VRR -- while also offering Dolby Atmos and DTS:X. Onkyo has four models, the most notable being the NR6100 which is the replacement for CNET's Editor's Choice, the TX-NR696. Meanwhile Pioneer has three.

Like the models Onkyo and Pioneer have released over the last few years, the products include a complete suite of streaming protocols: Apple AirPlay 2, Chromecast, Works with Sonos and DTS Play-Fi. FireConnect doesn't appear to be available but Play-Fi can perform the same function, so it's not missed. The receivers will also allow voice control via both Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa.

The receivers offer two-way Bluetooth communication for streaming from phones or listening on headphones. A powered second zone is included on all models. They can also connect a ""headphone dock"" for listening to two different sources in the same room, for example.

Here's what we know about Onkyo's 2021 receiver range:

Onkyo TX-NR5100

5.2.2 channels

80 watts per channel (stereo)

Four HDMI inputs and two outputs (with eARC)

Onkyo TX-NR6100

5.2.2 channels

100 watts per channel (stereo)

Six HDMI inputs and two outputs (with eARC)

Onkyo TX-NR7100

7.2.2 channels

100 watts per channel (stereo)

Seven HDMI inputs (one front) and two outputs (with eARC)

Dirac Live calibration

Onkyo TX-RZ50

7.2.2 channels

120 watts per channel stereo

Seven HDMI inputs (one front), two outputs (with eARC)

Pioneer's models include the following receivers:

Pioneer VSX-LX105

5.2.2 channels

Six HDMI inputs, two outputs

80 watts per channel

Pioneer VSX-LX305

7.2.2 channels

Seven HDMI inputs (one in front), two outputs

100 watts per channel



Pioneer VSX-LX505

7.2.2 channels

Seven HDMI inputs (one in front), two outputs

120 watts per channel

After two years it's good to see Onkyo return to one of its main strengths -- AV receivers -- and I have high expectations for the NR6100 in particular. Sony hasn't updated its flagship STR-DN1080 since 2017, so the main competition for the NR100 lineup now comes from Yamaha's excellent RX-V6A and the Denon AVR-960.

Pricing and availability on the range is yet to be announced.",['Ty Pendlebury'],https://news.google.com,high
"How Do We Feel About The Huge Wing On This 1,200 HP Lamborghini?","Photo : Zyrus Engineering

I don’t know about you, but when a tuning company takes a car that’s already quite fast and expensive and makes it even faster and more expensive , I tend to lose interest pretty quickly. However, something caught my eye about the Lamborghini Huracán-based Zyrus LP1200 Strada. I wonder what it could have been?



Of course, what I’m alluding to is the LP1200 Strada’s monstrous rear wing, which is so large it looks like it could comfortably seat two. But that wing is hardly the car’s only quality that could be described as monstrous.

As the name hints, Zyrus’ Huracán boast s 1,200 horsepower thanks to the addition of twin turbochargers to its 5.2-liter V10. Elsewhere, carbon-ceramic brakes, an Xtrac racing gearbox and Öhlins suspension are tasked with reining in those raging bulls and putting that power to good use. In total, the Norwegian engineering firm says it replaced more than 600 parts of the donor Huracán LP640-4 as part of the transformation.

Despite all of these track-minded enhancements and the mile-wide wing, the LP1200 Strada is street legal, just as advertised. Zyrus is making 12 of them, and at $732,000 they won’t even be quite as expensive as you might guess.



G/O Media may get a commission RAVPower MagSafe Charger $26 at Amazon Use the promo code KJEH28AR

Back to that wing, though. I think the real reason the LP1200 Strada captured my attention is because the rear third reminds me of so many late ’90s GT1 cars, particularly ones like the McLaren F1 GTR Longtail that were lengthened with additional bodywork after having already rac ed for several years.

In this era, GT1 was a perfect mix of roadgoing hypercar and purpose-built prototype. If the class were still continuing today in a similar guise, cars like the LP1200 Strada, I have a hunch, are what we’d see bearing down the Mulsanne. And, since you’re asking — yeah, I’d be into that.

Incidentally, the timing for such a revival is just right, as we’re on the brink of two new top classes in global sports car racing, one of which is centered on hypercars that more closely evoke manufacturer s’ production vehicles. In 2019, Lamborghini publicly flirted with the idea of sending a hypercar to compete for the overall win at the 24 Hours of Le Mans. Then last June it trotted out the Essenza SCV12, which isn’t eligible for such racing but definitely looks as if it should be.

At this point, I wouldn’t bet on a factory-backed, global endurance program from Lamborghini. I f nothing else, cars like the one Zyrus has built, and that SCV12, give us ideas of what such an effort might ha ve looked like.",[],https://news.google.com,high
ProMotion and always-on display again suggested for iPhone,"A third supply-chain report says that Apple plans to use LTPO screens for this year’s iPhone Pro models, which could enable ProMotion and always-on display.

Two previous reports have suggested that Apple plans to take the type of OLED panels used in the Apple Watch Series 4 and 5 and bring them to this year’s flagship iPhones …

All iPhone 12 models have OLED screens, and that isn’t going to change in this year’s models. But what may change is the type of OLED used — specifically, the adoption of low-temperature polycrystalline oxide (LPTO) panels, which allow variable refresh rates. That opens up two possibilities.

First, the refresh rate can be boosted to improve responsiveness of the screen. This is what Apple does on the iPad Pro, using 120Hz refresh cycles under the marketing name ProMotion. It’s most beneficial when using the Apple Pencil, but also makes for smoother and faster action in games, as well as smoother scrolling.

Second, the opposite can be done: reducing the refresh rate when little is changing on the screen. This reduces power consumption. Apple does this on the Apple Watch Series 5 to enable the always-on display without a massive hit on battery life. (The same display tech is used in the Series 4, but Apple didn’t choose to enable the feature for that.)

Previous reports have pointed to LG making LTPO panels for this year’s iPhones, but today’s TheElec report says that Samsung will be the sole supplier for 2021.

Samsung Display will be the exclusive supplier used by Apple for organic light emitting diode (OLED) panels used in the two highest tier models of its next iPhone, TheElec has learned. Both models of iPhone 13 will use low-temperature polycrystalline oxide (LTPO) thin-film transistors (TFT) OLED panels made by Samsung Display. Apple’s iPhone 13 will have four models and all of them will use OLED panels. The top two models will use LTPO OLED that can support 120Hz refresh rate.

LG is still expected to supply LTPO screens for future iPhones, but only from 2022. Samsung currently has the edge on the technology as it has already used it in the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra.

The report suggests one other change next year: It says that while LTPO will be reserved for the Pro models this year, Apple is hoping to expand the tech to all of next year’s models.

A couple of cautionary notes are in order. First, the source for all three LTPO reports is the same. Second, while LTPO displays do make always-on screens practical, that doesn’t mean that Apple will choose to implement the feature. The company may instead decide to reduce the battery capacity in order to make slimmer phones.

Tile is making a UWB tracker to compete with Apple's AirTags,"Tile has been the go-to brand when it comes to reliable Bluetooth trackers, and its wide variety of products cater to different use cases. But all of its trackers rely on Bluetooth, which works just fine, but it's not as sophisticated as ultra-wideband (UWB) — tech that is reported to be used in upcoming products from Apple and Samsung. Word is that Tile is also working on a new product that boasts the same tech and is expected to be released in 2021.

The new tracker is said to look similar to the Tile Mate in that it will have a rounded square shape, a center button, a keychain hole, and a flat back to support adhesive-based mounting. The most striking difference will be the use of UWB that will make it easier to locate misplaced items.

Concept art of the upcoming Tile

UWB tech uses a short-range wireless protocol like Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. But unlike the latter, UWB operates at high frequencies, which makes it possible to record directional/spatial data. This makes it particularly useful for trackers, especially in cases where it's difficult to discern its location by ringing it.

To make most of the new technology, the Tile app will offer users an AR-enabled camera view that will show the tracker's location and guide users to it using arrows. However, it's worth noting is that very few phones currently support UWB — the Samsung Note 20 Ultra and the iPhone 11/12 series are among the handful that do. There is no information on pricing for Tile's new trackers just yet.",['Prasham Parikh'],https://news.google.com,high
"The Sinking City returns to stores, but its legal troubles are ongoing","Lovecraftian RPG The Sinking City is available to buy again, after an ongoing legal dispute between developers Frogwares and publishers Nacon saw it removed from digital storefronts back in August. According to a statement from Nacon, the dispute is still pending in French courts. But, for now at least, The Sinking City is back for sale on Xbox One, and will be available on Steam and PS4 again soon.

Back in August, Frogwares claimed in an open letter that Nacon (formerly Bigben Interactive) tried to claim copyright of the game after its release, allegedly withheld payments during development, and owed Frogwares around 1 million euros in unpaid royalties (about £900,000).

The devs said they terminated their contract with Nacon in July 2020. The Sinking City then started disappearing from digital stores due to, what Frogwares believes, was confusion over the game’s ownership. The developers then removed it from other storefronts to try and stop further sales going to Nacon.

At the time, Nacon rejected Frogwares’ claims. In a new statement released by the publisher yesterday, they say the dispute is still pending in the French courts, and in October, the Paris Court Of Appeal ruled that Frogwares unlawfully terminated their contract with Nacon. Now, the developers have to stick to the contract until the legal troubles are settled.

“Confirmed in its expectations by this decision and regardless of the time needed to resolve this dispute definitively, Nacon is continuing its action in defense of its rights and has proceeded with the execution of this court decision by asking platforms and sites to put The Sinking City game back online so that no one is held hostage to this situation,” Nacon said. “It is however specified that insofar as some of the game’s online stakes depend on the goodwill of Frogwares to perform, their absence cannot be attributed to Nacon.”

At the time of writing, The Sinking City is available to buy on Xbox One. It has a Steam page up too, with all the DLC bits and pieces listed, though isn’t on sale there just yet. It’ll hit PS4 at “a later date” as well.

In her The Sinking City review, Alice Bee though it was an alright detective game, held up by its Lovecraftian themes: “Without the weird Lovecraftian bits, this is a slightly janky, slightly grindy detective game that does some interesting things in a very atmospheric depiction of a profoundly depressed town.”",['News Writer'],https://news.google.com,high
"SpaceX scraps Starship SN8 wreckage, clears landing zone for next launch","In spite of tentative plans for preservation, SpaceX has fully scrapped the wreckage of the first high-altitude Starship prototype, clearing the landing zone it impacted for its successor’s imminent launch debut.

Known as serial number 8 or SN8, the Starship prototype was the first of any kind to fly beyond 150 meters (~500 ft), reaching an altitude of 12.5 km (~7.8 mi) on December 9th during its breathtaking launch debut. In an unexpected twist, SpaceX kept Starship SN8’s thrust to weight ratio as low as possible, stretching what could have been a two or three-minute test into an almost seven-minute ordeal with three consecutive Raptor engine cutoffs during the ascent.

At apogee, SN8 used cold gas thrusters to flip into a belly-down orientation and free-fell ~95% of the way back to Earth before igniting two of its three Raptor engines, performing a wild powered flip back into a vertical landing position and nearly securing a soft landing. Unfortunately, around 10-20 seconds before that planned landing, what Musk later described as low methane header tank pressure starved the Starship’s engines of fuel and more or less cut all appreciable thrust, causing SN8 to reach its landing zone traveling about 40 m/s (~90 mph) too fast. The rocket impacted the concrete pad, crumpled, and exploded.

Agreed, should be preserved in memory of SN8 — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) December 11, 2020

By all accounts, success was one of the less likely outcomes SpaceX expected from SN8’s high-altitude debut, with Musk himself estimating the odds of total success to be just 33%. Additionally, Starship SN8 effectively made it all the way to a low-speed landing regime that Starships SN5 and SN6 all but flawlessly demonstrated with back-to-back 150m hops and landings in August and September 2020.

In other words, despite the explosive end, SN8’s high-altitude launch debut was a spectacular success for SpaceX’s Starship program – possibly even preferable to a perfect landing given that it uncovered an unexpected issue with fuel tank pressurization. Beyond the landing failure, the Starship checked every single box on SpaceX’s test flight list, successfully debuting multiple Raptors, demonstrating multiple in-flight engine shutdowns and engine relights; proving that an unprecedented ‘skydiver-style’ landing maneuver is possible and viable; and successfully testing Starship’s ability to control itself in that bellyflop orientation with thrusters and four massive flaps.

Speaking in a recent interview with Ars Technica, in the words of pragmatic SpaceX COO and President Gwynne Shotwell, SN8’s launch debut “de-risked [the Starship] program pretty massively.” According to Musk, SpaceX engineers were quickly able to determine why Starship SN8’s methane header tank was unable to maintain the fuel flow (pressure) needed for Raptor’s landing burn(s) and quickly implemented a solution.

SN9 will press CH4 header tank with helium. Long-term solution is under debate. Not clear what is lightest/simplest. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) December 30, 2020

Thanks to a quick, temporary fix, Starship SN9’s own 12.5 km launch debut remains on track to despite SN8’s failed landing. (NASASpaceflight – bocachicagal)

SN9 appeared to complete a cryogenic proof test on December 29th and could attempt its first static fire as early as January 6th. (NASASpaceflight – bocachicagal)

Instead of pressurizing autogenously with methane gas, Starship SN9 will use helium to pressurize its fuel header tank, serving as a temporary fix while SpaceX determines what changes need to be made to get rid of that helium crutch. Landing pad now cleared of Starship remains and SN8’s impact crater more or less repaired, the only thing standing between Starship SN9 and its own 12.5 km launch debut is a triple-Raptor static fire test. Originally expected as early as January 4th, SpaceX never made it more than a few minutes into the attempt, while a backup window on January 5th was canceled later that evening. The test could now occur no earlier than (NET) Wednesday, January 6th.

Although SpaceX couldn’t fully salvage SN8’s nosecone wreckage, it did snag a mostly intact flap before scrapping the rest. (NASASpaceflight – bocachicagal)

Thankfully, although SpaceX was unable to save the entirety of Starship SN8’s wrecked nose section, the company did manage to extract a largely intact nose flap. The rest of the remains were scrapped on site and trucked away but it’s possible that certain significant components of SN8 – particularly the recovered flap – will eventually find themselves on display at one or more SpaceX facilities.",['Eric Ralph'],https://news.google.com,high
Graphics cards face further shortages as crypto prices rise,"TL;DR: Is a depressingly familiar scenario set to return? Following the recent jump in cryptocurrency prices, especially Bitcoin’s, graphics cards are expected to become even more scarce as miners grab them in bulk for their rigs. The situation is exacerbating the current supply problems experienced by the RTX 3000 and Radeon RX 6000 series.

After hitting its previous record of $19,700 in late 2017, Bitcoin dropped to a low of $3,200 a year later. It stagnated between $7,000 and $9,000 for a long time, but since December, its price has gone through the roof, passing $20,000 last month and breaking the $30K barrier recently.

Ethereum has experienced a similar resurgence—the crypto’s price has quadrupled in the last year to around $1,000.

Crypto prices via coinmarketcap

The more valuable a cryptocurrency, the more profit a miner can make each day. And with the new generation of graphics cards offering more power at lower price points than ever before, people can break even in fewer days. Tom’s Hardware notes that the $399 RTX 3060 Ti will have paid for itself after 80 days of mining.

History does appear to be repeating. As Bitcoin and Ethereum soared in 2017, the price of graphics cards—those in stock—skyrocketed as demand far outweighed supply. Consumer anger led to Nvidia requesting that retailers prioritize gamers over miners. Eventually, a slumping crypto market saw GPU prices finally return to normal. When the crypto crash came, Nvidia’s share price plummeted, and last year it faced a lawsuit alleging that the company reported $1 billion in crypto revenue as gaming revenue.

What’s unique this time around is that we’ve been experiencing a shortage of the latest graphics cards since their release. Nvidia has repeatedly said that its GPU supply issues will last until at least the end of January, and with crypto prices continuing to rise, it could be a while before gamers can upgrade their PCs.

How One Modder Discovered Nintendo's Most Advanced Miis Hiding in Zelda: Breath of the Wild,"After two generations at the centre of Nintendo’s consoles, Miis seemingly took a back seat for Switch. You can still design a Nintendo-themed avatar on the handheld hybrid system, but Nintendo games support them far less frequently, with token appearances in Mario Kart 8 Deluxe or Super Smash Bros. Ultimate their most notable appearances. It led many to believe the age of the Mii was over, but a new discovery seems to show that Miis are secretly at the heart of one of Nintendo’s most beloved Switch games – The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild

see deal The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild - Wii U $59.88 on Walmart

On January 4, Mii modder HEYimHeroic posted a discovery that seemed to confirm that Mii-like parameters had been used to create NPCs in Breath of the Wild, by using modding to inject custom Miis’ details into the game and seeing their familiar cartoon faces rendered as Hylians in Breath of the Wild’s art style. Those results seem to prove that Breath of the Wild’s NPCs are a form of advanced Mii - a point the game’s code helps support by referring to them as ‘UMiis’.



Hi, Mii expert here. Turns out, the NPCs in TLoZ:BotW use an advanced version of the Mii format. This means that with modding, you can inject Miis into the game. :) Thinking about opening commissions for Mii injects, both screenshot/images of your Mii and mod downloads! pic.twitter.com/8NfVr4zyqA



— i'm alice (@HEYimHeroic) January 4, 2021

Have you played The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild? YES NO

HEYimHeroic has been researching Miis for around a year, starting the in-depth Wii Facts Plus Twitter account and a library of all Nintendo-created Miis along the way. Speaking to me over Twitter, they explain that the Breath of the Wild modding community had theorised that Miis could be related to Breath of the Wild’s NPCs since shortly after the game launched, even finding the term UMii related to NPCs when combing the game’s files. However, that search seemed to have died down in the intervening years: “The modders I've spoken to assumed that it was only just a name, after a while, and that was pretty much where the similarities ended,” explains HEYimHeroic. “No one had ever actually attempted to port Miis into the game... and I did that out of sheer curiosity!”

The breakthrough was in realising that UMiis share ID values for parts of their construction with traditional Miis: “Every type of mouth, eyes, hair, etc. all have a certain ID value attached to them with Miis. The big thing here is that UMiis also share the exact same ID values, so this part's probably the easiest - just copy and paste the ID value from the Mii into the UMii!” HEYimHeroic then discovered that Mii colour values are drawn from altered Wii U versions of the avatars, rather than the original Mii Studio and (with an anonymous friend’s help) discovered how to convert and assign those properly. Mii sizing is one of the more confusing elements, with existing values not always corresponding with how they turn out within Breath of the Wild. “More testing is needed,” explains the modder, “but we know enough about them to port Miis in most of the time!”

“ HEYimHeroic thinks Nintendo used, “a manual creation tool, like Mii Maker. Or, maybe... UMii Maker?”

The upshot was that, on December 30, HEYimHeroic managed to inject their own Mii design into the game and - with the help of a Breath of the Wild modding server - managed to create a UMii version of an existing Mii. “Looking back, now that I know more about the format,” they explain, “I definitely could've improved more, but at the time, it was more than enough to convince people that Miis and UMiis aren't that different after all.”

What HEYimHeroic had discovered was that - aside from key characters like Link and Zelda - Nintendo had seemingly used the UMii system to create every NPC in the game. While non-humanlike races such as Gorons use a very limited set of variable, human-like races Hylians and Sheikah use many of the same kinds of backend values as Miis in their creation. Every NPC appears to be custom-built, rather than generated, which HEYimHeroic thinks means Nintendo used, “a manual creation tool, like Mii Maker. Or, maybe... UMii Maker?”



also, here are the full screenshots of the four Miis i posted in that main tweet. pic.twitter.com/lAYScS43eF — i'm alice (@HEYimHeroic) January 4, 2021

If a formal UMii Maker does exist, its differences from the classic Mii Maker are as interesting as its similarities. For example, the option to add moles to Miis aren’t supported for UMiis, and not all Mii hairstyles are replicated (although the game will automatically convert an unsupported hairstyle into a similar one). “Glasses size, position, and mustache position are also all removed,” adds HEYimHeroic. “These values are no longer manually set, but the game automatically determines them based on the rest of the face. For example, if you move the mouth lower on the face, then the mustache will be automatically moved lower on the face, too.”

Despite those changes, there appears to be far more nuance to how a UMii can be created when compared to a Mii. “This is easily the most intricate usage of Miis yet,” explains HEYimHeroic when I ask if this is the most advanced version of Mii they’ve discovered. “In fact, it's so complex, it's hard to still call them ‘Miis’ anymore. Depending on how strict your definition of what a ‘Mii’ is, you could say these aren't even Miis at all! Previously, I thought the most interesting use of Miis was actually in Super Mario 3D Land, of all games, where some levels you get are based on your Mii’s favorite color. But this takes the cake!”

“ This is easily the most intricate usage of Miis yet. In fact, it's so complex, it's hard to still call them ‘Miis’ anymore.

At time of writing, many of the new features for creating NPCs remain unknown, but HEYimHeroic is on a quest to document them. “For example,” the modder explains, “there's about 4 more values that only exist to control the NPC's pupils. [And] there's only 12 favorite colors Miis support, but I've seen UMiis go up to 14, possibly higher! [...] There are a lot more color options than the game's currently letting on, so I'd really like to dig into those. Also figuring out some of the unknown values (like the 4 pupil values) would really allow for editing the subtle details, that would really add to the magic of the UMiis.”

There’s a long way to go, but there appears to be no doubt that UMiis are indeed a step beyond the Miis we know. Which begs the question - is it possible we could see UMiis used in other Nintendo games, or even get to create them ourselves in a non-modding context? HEYimHeroic has bad news on that front:

“Most likely, no. Well, we might see UMiis return in Breath of the Wild's sequel... but as far as completely different games go? No. There's way too [much] BotW-specific stuff here, it's difficult to imagine that UMiis were made for a ‘general use’ sort of deal. In fact, we believe the name ‘UMii’ stems from [Breath of the Wild’s] internal name found in the files: UKing. So, the name ‘UMiis’ might literally mean ‘Breath of the Wild Miis’, but there's not a way to know for sure on that one!”

Loading

If that’s the case, what about Miis in general? What does the world’s now most notable Mii modder see as the future of Nintendo’s increasingly invisible mascots?

“Before finding all of this, I wouldn't have given you a very optimistic answer. But that was because I didn't even know Nintendo was willing to transform Miis like this! I have a good feeling Miis will at least make an appearance on the next platform, but I can tell Nintendo's running out of reasons for them to stay, which is very unfortunate. However, as long as they're willing to make things like UMiis that have plenty of Mii DNA in their files, I'll be able to find workarounds eventually, and get Miis into games that shouldn't even have them. At least then, we still have Miis in some form.”

Even if we are looking at the final piece of Mii evolution, this feels like something of a fitting tribute. Miis represent so much of Nintendo’s recent past, becoming the friendly face of Nintendo gaming for well over a decade, and becoming icons in the process. They’re as much a part of the company’s visible history as Mario or Link themselves. It seems only fair, then, that they make up an integral (if almost invisible) piece of perhaps Nintendo’s greatest game of that same period.

Tenchu: Stealth Assassins Creator Wants to Make a New Game for PS5 [Updated],"As Twinfinite points out, Endo actually said he'd like to create a stealth ninja game for PS5 - indicating something more like a successor to the original Tenchu games - rather than a definitive new entry in the series. IGN apologises for the error.

Tenchu: Stealth Assassins creator and president of Acquire, Takuma Endo has said that he would like to create a new Tenchu game for the PlayStation 5 - but nothing is formally in the works right now.

Have you played Tenchu: Shinobi-Hyakusen? YES NO

In an interview with Weekly Famitsu (translated by Gematsu ), Takuma Endo said that he would like to ""create a new Tenchu from the ground up for the PlayStation 5 generation if the possibility arises"", but also acknowledges that it's currently difficult.That difficulty likely stems from the fact that the Tenchu IP is currently owned by FromSoftware, who released Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice in 2019. In the early stages, Sekiro was being developed as a Tenchu successor, but From Software eventually decided to take the development in a different direction. It's not clear if the developer has any plans for the Tenchu franchise at this point.Back in August of last year, Acquire registered a trademark for ""Stealth Assassins"" in Japan which set the rumour mill off that a remake or spiritual successor was in the works. In the same interview with Famitsu, Endo mentions that this was merely a formality, as the trademark had expired.Elsewhere, Endo mentioned that Acquire plans to launch an ""indies brand"" separate from its main output, with the first title coming ""by the end of 2021"". Here's our review of Sekiro from 2019 , which we scored a 9.5, lauding its ""focused stealth-action take on t he FromSoftware formula"".Back in 1998, we awarded Tenchu: Stealth Assassins a 9/10 review , calling it ""the quintessential PlayStation game. Hard-core, smart, bloody, and fun as hell.""

"Dr. Dre's house targeted in burglary attempt a day after he was admitted to hospital, police say","One day after he was admitted to the hospital for a brain aneurysm, music mogul Dr. Dre's hilltop Los Angeles home was the target of an attempted burglary, and four suspects were arrested, according to the Los Angeles Police Department.

LAPD officer Lizeth Lomeli confirmed to NBC News that around 10 p.m. on Tuesday night, LAPD officers responded to a report of an attempted burglary in which suspects were seen ""coming over a hill"" near the 12700 block of Charon Road in the hills above Brentwood.

After a ""short pursuit,"" Lomeli said, four suspects were arrested. An investigation is ongoing.

A public trail runs to the immediate east of homes on this block, according to Google Maps, which shows hilltop mansions with large pools and tennis courts.

In 2014, the Los Angeles Times reported that Dre paid $40 million for a Brentwood mansion owned by Tom Brady and Gisele Bundchen.

The attempted break-in happened shortly after the news of Dre's aneurysm was announced.

A spokesperson for Dr. Dre, whose real name is Andre Young, confirmed to NBC News that he was admitted to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center on Monday for treatment of a brain aneurysm.

In a public post on his Instagram account Tuesday night, Dre confirmed his hospitalization and said he's ""doing great.""

""I will be out of the hospital and back home soon,"" Dre wrote. ""Shout out to all the great medical professionals at Cedars. One Love!!""

CORRECTION (Jan. 6, 2021, 12:42 a.m. ET): A previous version of this article misstated when Dr. Dre's home was targeted in a burglary attempt.

New couple Harry Styles and Olivia Wilde aren’t just turning heads at socially distanced weddings.

On Sunday, Styles, 26, and Wilde, 36, were spotted with friends in Santa Barbara, Calif., where the “Watermelon Sugar” crooner wrapped his arm around the “Booksmart” director’s back, as captured in new photos published Wednesday by the Daily Mail.

Styles sported a black hoodie, gray sweats and a pink beanie for the weekend outing, while Wilde rocked an argyle sweater and dark slacks. Both also wore face masks.

Earlier this week, Page Six published exclusive photos of Styles and Wilde holding hands at the weekend wedding of his friend and agent, Jeff Azoff.

Wilde, who split from longtime fiancé Jason Sudeikis, 45, in early 2020, is directing Styles in the upcoming thriller “Don’t Worry Darling.”

During filming, which took place in Palm Springs, Calif., Styles stayed at pal James Corden’s nearby pad, allowing the former boy-bander to keep his budding romance with Wilde private.

“Harry had been staying at James Corden’s house near Palm Springs during filming, and so they were able to be alone and keep their relationship very secret,” a source previously told Page Six.

Prior to his romance with Wilde, Styles has been linked to Taylor Swift, Kendall Jenner and, most recently, Kiko Mizuhara.

Before getting engaged to “Saturday Night Live” alum Sudeikis in 2013, Wilde was married to Tao Ruspoli from 2003 to 2011.

"Model Bianca Rojas Seems to Confirm Theory She Was a Selena Gomez Lookalike in The Weeknd's ""Save Your Tears""","Photo credit: Sean Zanni - Getty Images

From Seventeen

Fans have been having so much fun watching The Weeknd's new music video for ""Save Your Tears"" and now they're discovering some major easter eggs including one possibly about Selena Gomez.

Model Bianca Rojas, who starred in the music video alongside the R&B singer, posted photos of her on set shortly after the video was released on January 5.

Fans couldn't get enough of her look, with many also pointing out that she looked a little like Selena Gomez, who previously dated The Weeknd back in 2017. In the video, Bianca plays an audience member at his performance who he brings up on stage, dances with him, until everything goes back and he is suddenly trying to get her to shoot him with a gun that he had hidden the entire time.

just thinking because abel might watch dance again video before he reference selena in his save your tears mv OMG pic.twitter.com/hQOqyhlsJO — ofie ♡'s sel and h (@asweeterkiwi) January 5, 2021

One Selena fan commented on her Instagram post writing, ""You were looking like Selena.""

Bianca decided to have some fun and replied back with lyrics from Nicki Minaj's verse from ""Beauty and the Beat"" which she did with Justin Bieber, ""But I gotta keep an eye out for Selenerrrr.""

wait this confirms she we supposed to look like selena for the weeknd’s mv pic.twitter.com/rBLb1RlzZv — 𐩡 𐩺 𐩬 𐩱 (@leenasuss) January 6, 2021

Of course, it can totally be a coincidence and she even pointed out that she didn't 100 percent confirm that she was meant to be just like Sel in the video.

As the girl who played the lead in this music video...I never confirmed this lol. I love Selena thooooo — ✿ bibi ✿ (@bibirojass) January 5, 2021

Either way though, she seems to be having fun chatting with Selena Gomez stans and even revealed her favorite track from the singer is ""Back to You.""

Maybe this means that he's still thinking of her? Guess we'll have to wait and see if this sparks a reconciliation.

Hayley Williams says she is recording her “own ‘Folklore'”,"Hayley Williams has revealed she is recording her own equivalent of Taylor Swift‘s ‘Folklore’.

Posting on Instagram, the Paramore singer uploaded two clips, one showing the singer drumming and another in which she says: “We don’t need drums if this is my ‘Folklore’.” You can view the post below.

Swift’s acclaimed album which was co-written and produced by The National’s Aaron Dessner, was recently nominated for a number of 2021 Grammy awards, including Album of the Year.

When ‘Folklore’ was released in July, NME gave the album four stars, welcoming the singer’s initial “indie-folk makeover”.

The singer has since released it’s follow up ‘Evermore’ which received five stars last month, with NME praising Swift for “[pushing] the boundaries of her indie reinvention, adding a bit of ‘1989’-era gloss to produce a beacon of hope”.

‘Evermore’ – which is Swift’s sixth UK Number One album – set a new record among female artists, with the singer achieving her six UK number one albums in a record eight years.

The singer is also the first artist in four years to get to the Number One spot with two different albums within the same calendar year.

Meanwhile, Williams released her own debut solo ‘Petals For Armor‘, last February which was also awarded four stars by NME and described as the singer “going it alone with fiercely vulnerable alt-pop”.

'Avengers: Endgame' Easter egg reveals a genius foreshadowing you missed,"When it comes to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, a franchise full of big, epic moments and soap opera dramatics, it's easy to forget that movies like Avengers: Endgame are still movies. It's a visual medium that can tell a story in a way mere words cannot.

Which is why even now, nearly two years after its release, fans on Reddit are picking up visual foreshadows in Avengers: Endgame that our raw emotions maybe blinded us to. In this case, it was the death of Tony Stark, teased by his... helmet?

What Happened? — On January 4, a Reddit user named (fittingly) u/IronManMkXLVI shared on r/marvelstudios a visual foreshadow of the death of Tony Stark, played by Robert Downey Jr. u/IronManMkXLVI pointed out that Stark's broken helmet, which Stark uses to record a message to Pepper Pots in the ship with Nebula, is scarred on its right side. The visual mirrors the severe burns on Tony Stark's face after his brutal fight with Thanos.

""Maybe I missed it, but has no one pointed out this foreshadowing?"" wrote u/IronManMkXLVI. ""The helmet was damaged differently in [Infinity War], but it changed to reflect Tony’s final moments in Endgame. Fine on the left side, damaged on right.""

Scroll down in the comments, and you'll find Marvel fans argue over what counts as a ""helmet."" But that's not important. What's important is that u/IronManMkXLVI picked up a clear visual foreshadow that many fans haven't publicly talked about, at least not in a way that ends up a viral ""Did you know?"" meme your friends share on Facebook. Consider this a newly ""discovered"" piece of the movie.

Remember Gus Fring? — Potential spoilers if you haven't seen the TV show Breaking Bad yet. (It's been streaming on Netflix forever. What are you waiting for?) But a similar visual to Tony Stark in Endgame was famously used in the acclaimed television show Breaking Bad, which foreshadowed the death of Gus Fring (Giancarlo Esposito) with facial scarring.

Since the start of the show's second season, a recurring image of a half-burned teddy bear with a missing eye (originating from a plane crash Walter White accidentally caused) haunted viewers until, at the end of Season 4, they finally learned why: It was how Gus Fring was going to die.

There's no direct connection to this and Avengers: Endgame, which is a wildly different story with wildly different themes. But for budding cinema studies students, it's a succinct lesson in visual storytelling that isn't distracting or too obvious.

A missing Easter egg? — It's probably important to mention that this isn't an Easter egg. Easter eggs are, or at least should be, cute, subtle references to existing mythology or trivia. What this is is classic filmmaking. Directors Joe and Anthony Russo (as well as the countless other professionals behind the camera) intended to foreshadow Tony Stark's death right at the beginning of the film. By using Tony Stark's irremovable identity as Iron Man, the foreshadow deepens the significance of Iron Man's sacrifice. It's smart, it's clever, and like Babe Ruth pointing his slugger up to the skies in the Bronx, it's the movie calling its shot.

And all the while, none of us were that wise. (At the same time, Downey Jr.'s perfect ""I am Iron Man"" line in Endgame, which ties back to the beginning of the MCU in 2008's Iron Man, was improvised on the spot. So who knows how much any of this is planned ahead.)

The Inverse Analysis — The subtlety of this Avengers: Endgame foreshadow is remarkable. This one definitely flew past even the hardest of hardcore fans. I just think it's neat to be learning something new about our favorite movies, even now.",[],https://news.google.com,high
Cyborg Cameo Written Out of ‘The Flash'; Role Played by Ray Fisher Won’t Be Recast,"“Justice League” actor Ray Fisher, who was offered a cameo role last June to appear as Cyborg in “The Flash” solo movie, publicly stated he did not want to be involved with the project via Twitter, hence the character of Cyborg has been written out of the screenplay and will not be recast, according to insiders with knowledge of the situation.

Fisher publicly resigned from the role last week in his continuing beef with DC Films President Walter Hamada, who is overseeing “The Flash.” The actor tweeted on Dec. 30, “Walter Hamada is the most dangerous kind of enabler. He lies, and WB PR’s failed Sept. 4th hit-piece sought to undermine the very real issues of the Justice League investigation.”

Fisher added in his tweet, “I will not participate in any production associated with him.” Of note, Hamada did not oversee the “Justice League” production and was not the head of DC Films at the time, nor was he employed during the film’s initial release.

Also Read: Walter Hamada Extends Deal as DC Films President Through 2023

Hamada first joined DC Films back in 2018 and lead the division to the release of its highest-grossing film to date, 2018’s “Aquaman,” which banked over $1.4 billion at the worldwide box office. On Tuesday, it was announced that Hamada had reupped his deal as president until 2023. Fisher called the news “reactionary” in a tweet later that day.

Fisher, in his only film role, first appeared as Cyborg in 2017’s “Justice League.” His final appearance as Cyborg will be in the “Justice League” Snyder Cut, which will premiere this spring on HBO Max.

Fisher’s beef with DC Films and Hamada first surfaced last July, when the actor publicly accused “Justice League” director Joss Whedon of “gross, abusive, unprofessional” behavior on set. Fisher said Whedon’s behavior was enabled by then-DC Entertainment president Geoff Johns and by Jon Berg, former co-president of production at WB. Berg left the company in December 2017 as part of a “restructuring,” while Johns stepped down seven months later.

Warner Bros. launched an independent investigation in mid-August, a move initially celebrated by Fisher. But on Sept. 4, he criticized the company on Twitter, saying, “After speaking out about Justice League, I received a phone call from the President of DC Films wherein he attempted to throw Joss Whedon and Jon Berg under the bus in hopes that I would relent on Geoff Johns. I will not.”

In a counter-statement later that day, Warner Bros. denied Fisher’s accusation against Hamada and said the actor had never actually accused anyone of “actionable conduct.” The company also said Fisher refused to speak to the investigator despite multiple attempts to reach him.

In a statement released on Dec. 11, WarnerMedia said it had concluded its investigation into accusations by Fisher of inappropriate conduct during the production of “Justice League.” The company said “remedial action” was taken, but declined to clarify what that means.

The plot of “The Flash” will introduce audiences to the idea of the multiverse, one of the core concepts underpinning DC Comics. For the non-fanboy set, the multiverse refers to a shifting number of alternate universes that coexist within the larger reality depicted in DC comics. Originally created to explain various contradictory changes the company’s characters experienced over decades, it allows several different versions of the same characters to simultaneously exist and, occasionally, interact.

For example, Ben Affleck’s Batman is not the only Caped Crusader who will return in “The Flash” — Michael Keaton will also return to his role of Batman from the 1989 Tim Burton film, as TheWrap first exclusively reported.","['Umberto Gonzalez', 'Brian Welk']",https://news.google.com,high
"Deadliest Catch's Mahlon Reyes, 38, died of cocaine overdose in accidental death, coroner reveals","Blake Painter

Blake Painter

Before Reyes, former Deadliest Catch captain Blake Painter was found dead at his home in Astoria, Oregon, in May 2018.

Authorities never released a specific cause of death for painter, but TMZ reported that a number of drugs were found near his body, including heroin, meth and the prescription painkiller Tramadol.

His death was rumored to be from an accidental overdose after police found no evidence of foul play.

Joe McMahon

Joe McMahon

Joe McMahon, who served as an associate producer on nine episodes of Deadliest Catch in 2013, was shot and killed aged 24 near his parents' California home in July of 2015.

The LA Sheriff's Office determined that he was killed in a murder suicide after the suspected shooter was found dead in his car with a self-inflicted gunshot wound.

Reports at the time suggested that McMahon had gone outside to investigate a noise coming from the street when he was shot.

Witnesses reported hearing seven gunshots followed by the sound of a car driving away.

Investigators later identified McMahon's killer as 24-year-old Brandon Rafiepour. They did not say how the pair knew each other.

Tony Lara

Tony Lara

Tony Lara, former captain of the Cornelia Marie, died aged 50 after suffering a heart attack while sleeping in Sturgis, South Dakota, in August 2015.

Though he had only appeared in six episodes of Deadliest Catch, his death was felt deeply by members of the cast and crew.

'No conversation was cut short. No call unreturned,' Lara's crew said in a statement after his death. 'When the Cornelia Marie needed him, he was quick to respond with a ""When"" and ""Where.""

'He offered his support and his advice. He taught and he educated. At the end of the day, Tony made all of us just a little bit better.'

Justin Tennison

Justin Tennison

Justin Tennison, a deckhand on the Time Bandit, died aged 33 in 2011 at a hotel room in Homer, Alaska, just four days after returning from sea.

His death was ruled to be from complications with sleep apnea.

'Justin was tough as a bull and was an all-around good hand,' the ship's crew said in a statement announcing the news.

'The captains and crew appreciated his hard work and many contributions this past year. We will miss him terribly and wish his family all the best during this most difficult time.'

Keith Anderson

Keith Anderson

Keith Anderson, the father of Deadliest Catch star Jake Anderson, went missing in 2010 and his skeletal remains were found two years later in rural Washington state.

His death was ruled a homicide but eight years later no one has been arrested.

Deadliest Catch cameras captured the moment Jake Anderson learned that his father had gone missing, providing some of the most haunting scenes of the entire series.

After Keith Anderson's body was recovered, his son spoke candidly on the show about how the trauma had motivated him to be the best fisherman possible.

Phil Harris

Phil Harris

Phil Harris, captain of the Cornelia Marie, died aged 53 in 2010 - ten days after suffering a stroke while unloading crab in Alaska.

Immediately after the stroke Harris was transported to a hospital in Anchorage where he underwent surgery and was placed in a medically-induced coma.

A little over a week later he was brought out of the coma and pronounced dead.

Harris' son Josh opened up about his father's death in an interview with People at the time, revealing the comfort his family found in his final days.

'We had nine days total that we were there to enjoy a few moments with him,' Josh said. 'We had our closest people there, and it was awesome.'

Mahlon Reyes

Mahlon Reyes

Reyes was pronounced dead at a hospital in his hometown of Whitefish, Montana, soon after suffering a 'massive heart attack' on July 25.

It has since been revealed his death was caused by a cocaine overdose.

Reyes, who last appeared on Deadliest Catch in 2015, was at the time in the recovery process from a torn Achilles tendon, which he suffered while crabbing.

He was planning on going back to Alaska for the beginning of the next fishing season.

To honor his memory, Reyes' wife revealed she and his Deadliest Catch crew made plans to spread some of his ashes in the Bering Sea.

Nick McGlashan

Nick McGlashan

McGlashan, a seventh-generation fisherman and crabber who appeared on the Discovery Channel reality series for seven years, passed away in December in Nashville.

The 33-year-old was found unresponsive by a friend in a $79-per-night room at the Holiday Inn Nashville-Vanderbilt on West End Avenue at 12:30pm. He was pronounced dead at the scene by first responders shortly after.

Friends of the reality TV star told The Sun McGlashan had been in good spirits in the days leading up to his death.

However they say they fear the father-of-two, who for years had struggled with drug and alcohol abuse before getting clean in 2017, may have recently relapsed over Christmas.

In a statement, Nashville police said preliminary evidence 'indicated the possibility of drug involvement' in McGlashan's death.","['Jack Newman', 'Jack Newman For Mailonline']",https://news.google.com,high

Stone wore an evolvetogether face mask and held a reusable water bottle as she kept up with her female friend. Every now and then she would pull down the mask for some fresh air or a sip of water.

Reps for Stone refused to comment when approached by DailyMail.com.

The sighting comes after it was revealed last month that Stone had dropped out of an upcoming film featuring Brad Pitt.

Stone was slated to play the lead in La La Land director Damien Chazelle's Old Hollywood epic Babylon.

She left the cast after an apparent scheduling conflict. But perhaps the 'conflict' is taking time to raise her first child.

According to Deadline, Australian actress Margot Robbie, 30, is now being lined up by producers to swiftly replace Stone.

The movie was supposed to begin filming in Los Angeles before the coronavirus pandemic put a halt to plans, so it's likely the change in filming dates created a conflict.

Distributed by Paramount, Babylon is currently slated for a Christmas Day 2021 release.

They were reportedly supposed to have their wedding in mid-March, but had to call it off due to the coronavirus pandemic.

But in May, Stone had swapped out her engagement ring for a simple gold band, leading to speculation that she and McCary had secretly tied the knot.

Those pictures prompted the rumors that Stone was pregnant, as she was seen dressed in baggy overalls with an apparent bump.

Last May rumors first flew that Stone had secretly gotten married to McCary when she sported a wedding band during a YouTube appearance with Reese Witherspoon.

NFL Mock Draft 5.0,"National Football League NFL Mock Draft 5.0 5 hours ago share facebook twitter reddit link

By Jason McIntyre

FOX Sports betting analyst

The NFL regular season is in the rear view, the Top 18 picks are locked in for the April 2021 NFL Draft, and the No. 1 pick has officially declared.

You know what that means – it's draft season! There's still plenty of time left on the clock, and we will continue to update our draft as the playoffs unfold.

Good news: if your team is in need of a QB or a WR in round one, you’re in luck. Bad news: not so lucky if you need to bolster the middle of your defensive line and stop the run.

To the picks!

1. Jacksonville Jaguars – Trevor Lawrence, QB, Clemson (Previous rank: 1)

2020 season stats: 3,153 passing yards, 204passing TDs, 69.2 completion percentage

With two first round picks and two second rounders as well, the Jaguars are in a tremendous spot to quickly build a contender. Lawrence is a no-brainer, even if Urban Meyer takes the coaching job and you read chatter about Justin Fields. Don't be fooled: it’s Lawrence.

2. New York Jets – Zach Wilson, QB, BYU (5)

2020 season stats: 3,692 passing yards, 33 passing TDs, 73.5 completion percentage

For now, I remain steady in the Zach Wilson camp. He holds an advantage in quick decision-making, and he succeeded despite his lack of future pros on the OL or at the skill positions. Give me the hungry QB who has never been handed anything and has grinded to become an elite prospect. It is unlikely anyone else from his offense is drafted in 2021.

If the Jets can trade down a couple spots and grab him because someone is enamored with Justin Fields, even better.

3. Miami Dolphins (via Houston) – Penei Sewell, OT, Oregon (3)

Yes, they will have to take a look at a QB here. That’s what smart, forward-thinking front offices do. The Cowboys did it (Steve Walsh, Troy Aikman), the Cardinals did it (Josh Rosen, Kyler Murray). It’s not the exact same situation, but they must explore it. Ultimately, this will come down to protection vs. help on the outside – that can be addressed at 19.

4. Atlanta Falcons – Kwity Paye, Edge, Michigan (10)

2020 season stats: 2 sacks, 16 total tackles

Atlanta's QB Matt Ryan is 36 and coming off back-to-back subpar seasons following a glorious run from 2014-2018 when he graded out as a Top 8 QB in the NFL. The new regime will have to decide if they want one last hurrah with this group, or to hit the reset button. For now, the decision is to upgrade the defense, which finished 14th in efficiency, its highest rating since 2012.

5. Cincinnati Bengals – Micah Parsons, LB, Penn State (9)

2020 season stats: N/A (opted out of the season)

2019 season stats: 5.0 sacks, 109 total tackles, 4 fumbles forced, 1 fumble recovered, 5 passes defended

The Bengals missing on Penei Sewell because Brandon Allen and Ryan Finley pulled upset victories may hurt in the long run. Free agency must find them a tackle if they pass on Alijah Vera-Tucker or Rashawn Slater. If they don’t trade back, the defense needs an infusion of talent, and Parsons is a great start.

6. Philadelphia Eagles – DeVonta Smith, WR, Alabama (13)

2020 season stats: 105 receptions, 1,641 receiving yards, 20 receiving TDs

Let’s see what shakes out in free agency on the offensive line, but you can’t go into another season with guys like DeSean Jackson and Alshon Jeffery outside. The Smith vs. Chase debate will rage in Philly, but the Eagles can’t miss like they did on Jalen Reagor vs. Justin Jefferson.

7. Detroit Lions – Ja’Marr Chase, WR, LSU (11)

2020 season stats: N/A (opted out of the season)

2019 season stats: 84 receptions, 1,780 receiving yards, 20 receiving TDs

If-and-when Robert Saleh gets the head coaching job, everyone will project defense here. But let’s stop wasting QB Matthew Stafford’s time and get him another receiver. Tag Kenny Golladay and draft Chase, and you’ve got an insanely talented offense.

8. Carolina Panthers – Justin Fields, QB, Ohio State (2)

2020 season stats: 1,906 passing yards, 21 passing TDs, 73.4 completion percentage

If Fields torches Alabama the way he did Clemson, it’ll be difficult to keep him this low, but the Panthers are in a terrific spot to grab Matt Rhule’s QB of the future.

9. Denver Broncos – Trey Lance, QB, North Dakota State (7)

2020 season stats: N/A (only one exhibition game played)

2019 season stats: 2,786 passing yards, 28 passing TDs, 66.9 completion percentage; 1,100 rushing yards, 6.5 yards per carry, 14 rushing TDs

Now that John Elway has ceded control of the draft, perhaps someone can figure out the future of the QB situation in Denver. Lance, 20, hails from the midwest with a big arm, oozes potential, and might just end up winning the job over Drew Lock.

10. Dallas Cowboys – Rashawn Slater, OL, Northwestern (4)

The Cowboys QB situation is a tricky one, because paying Dak Prescott $35 million or more limits freedom in free agency, making hitting this pick crucial. A beaten-up OL has hindered the run game, but Andy Dalton still thrived with talented pass-catchers.

11. New York Giants – Caleb Farley, CB, Virginia Tech (14)

2020 season stats: N/A (opted out of the season)

2019 season stats: 4 INTs, 1 TD, 20 total tackles

Yes, I would I look long and hard at a QB here. But with the top four off the board, adding another high end CB talent greatly helps the defense. James Bradberry had an all-pro season, but the Giants could never figure out CB2 after the Deandre Baker disaster.

12. San Francisco 49ers – Patrick Surtain, CB, Alabama (12)

2020 season stats: 35 total tackles, 1 fumble recovery, 1 INT, 1 TD

Kyle Shanahan has proven time and time again he can take skill position players in any round and fit them into his creative schemes. But the secondary has been exposed in 2020. Eight 49ers CBs under contract are set to hit free agency in 2021, including Richard Sherman.

13. Los Angeles Chargers – Alijah Vera-Tucker, OT, USC (6)

The Chargers are going to be a hot playoff pick next year. They must keep Justin Herbert healthy and upright.

14. Minnesota Vikings – Gregory Rousseau, Edge, Miami (8)

2020 season stats: N/A (opted out of the season)

2019 season stats: 15.5 sacks, 54 total tackles, 2 fumbles forced, 1 fumble recovered

Mike Zimmer called the 2020 Vikings the ""worst defense he’s ever had.""

15. New England Patriots – Kyle Pitts, TE, Florida (16)

2020 season stats: 43 receptions, 770 receiving yards, 12 receiving TDs

The Pats don't have an answer at QB yet, but if Pitts falls this far, he’s perfect for New England coach Bill Belichick.

16. Arizona Cardinals – Jaylen Waddle, WR, Alabama (22)

2020 season stats: 25 receptions, 557 receiving yards, 4 receiving TDs (only played 4 games before suffering a season-ending injury)

2019 season stats: 33 receptions, 560 receiving yards, 6 receiving TDs

There will be some pressure on Arizona coach Kliff Kingsbury to adjust the offense and deliver after a rough ending to 2020.

17. Las Vegas Raiders – Jayson Oweh, Edge, Penn State (30)

2020 season stats: 1 pass defended, 38 total tackles

2019 season stats: 5.0 sacks, 2.0 fumbles forced, 21 total tackles

The pick here has to be defense. Has to be. After finishing 31st in defensive efficiency in 2019, they ""improved"" to 28th in 2020. Oweh allegedly ran a 4.33 40, which is music to Raiders coach Jon Gruden’s ears.

18. Miami Dolphins – Christian Barmore, DL, Alabama (15)

2020 season stats: 7 sacks, 3 forced fumbles, 3 passes defended, 32 total tackles

The Dolphins would hit a home run if they bolstered the OL and DL in the first round. Miami loves Alabama players, drafting three in the last three years.

19. Washington Football Team – Rondale Moore, WR, Purdue (NR)

2020 season stats: 35 receptions, 270 receiving yards, 0 receiving TDs

The defense is Top 10; the offense struggles to get 10.

20. Chicago Bears – Rashod Bateman, WR, Minnesota (23)

2020 season stats: 36 receptions, 472 receiving yards, 2 receiving TDs

Regardless if Allen Robinson stays or goes, there is a significant infusion of talented needed at receiver.

21. Jacksonville Jaguars (via LA Rams) – Samuel Cosmi, OL, Texas (26)

The 6-foot-7 anchor morphed from a three-star recruit to an All-American.

22. Indianapolis Colts – Jeremiah Owusu-Koramoah, Edge, Notre Dame (18)

2020 season stats: 1.5 sacks, 61 total tackles, 3 forced fumbles, 2 fumbles recovered, 3 passes defended

Indianapolis edge rusher Justin Houston turns 32 this month, and he ranked 2nd on the team in sacks. The Colts had a Top 10 defense, and adding to it could vault them into the Top 5.

23. Cleveland Browns – Joseph Ossai, Edge, Texas (NR)

2020 season stats: 5 sacks, 54 total tackles, 3 forced fumbles, 1 fumble recovered, 2 passes defended

The Browns need help on the interior, but there’s more value in getting an edge rusher in this spot. Ossai, new to the board, had 16 TFL, five sacks, three forced fumbles, and was an All-American.

24. Tennessee Titans – Jaycee Horn, CB, South Carolina (24)

2020 season stats: 2 INTs, 6 passes defended, 16 total tackles

The Titans defense is by far the worst of any playoff team.

25. Tampa Bay Buccaneers – Carlos Basham Jr, Edge, Wake Forest (21)

2020 season stats: 5 sacks, 1 fumble forced, 28 total tackles

Four months from the draft, it feels like this pick will be on the line or in the secondary.

26. Baltimore Ravens – Pat Freiermuth, TE, Penn State (17)

2020 season stats: 23 receptions, 310 receiving yards, 1 receiving TD

The Ravens have clearly regressed offensively from 2019 to 2020, and they need receivers badly. But the loss of Hayden Hurst to Atlanta followed by the injury to Nick Boyle has hurt blocking as well as pass-catching.

27. New York Jets (via Seattle) – Wyatt Davis, G, Ohio State (25)

If Davis falls this far, he's a gift for a young QB.

28. Pittsburgh Steelers – Christian Darrisaw, OT, Virginia Tech (32)

The offensive line is the biggest need on a loaded roster.

29. New Orleans Saints – Zaven Collins, LB, Tulsa (29)

2020 season stats: 4 sacks, 54 total tackles, 2 fumbles forced, 1 fumble recovered, 2 passes defended

The Saints don’t have many weaknesses, and Collins makes sense as a linebacker who could play a hybrid safety role at times.

30. Buffalo Bills – Levi Onwuzurike, DL, Washington (NR)

2020 season stats: 2 sacks, 45 total tackles

If the Bills get run over by the Colts, this pick will move from a ""yeah, makes sense"" to ""let’s make this happen, now.""

30. Green Bay Packers – Nick Bolton, LB, Missouri (NR)

2020 season stats: 2 sacks, 95 total tackles, 1 fumble recovered, 5 passes defended

He’s been one of the best linebackers in the SEC over the last two seasons, and finally makes an appearance on this mock draft.

32. Kansas City Chiefs – Azeez Ojulari, Edge, Georgia

2020 season stats: 8.5 sacks, 31 total tackles, 4 fumbles forced, 1 fumble recovered, 2 passes defended

Here's yet another new name in the mock draft after Ojulari completed a strong season leading the Bulldogs in forced fumbles (4), sacks (8.5), and TFL (12.5).

Sources: George Washington's game against UMass postponed due to D.C. curfew,"The chaos at the United States Capitol on Wednesday afternoon has spilled over into the sports world.

George Washington’s men’s basketball game against the University of Massachusetts, scheduled for 6 p.m. ET Wednesday in Washington D.C., has been postponed, multiple sources told Yahoo Sports.

A source told Yahoo Sports that the reasoning for the game being off was the 6 p.m. curfew announced by D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser.

The curfew came in the wake of supporters of President Donald Trump storming the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday afternoon.

There has been no immediate word if or when the game between George Washington (3-7) and UMass (2-3) would be rescheduled.

Trump supporters try to break through a police barrier, Wednesday, Jan. 6, 2021, at the Capitol in Washington. As Congress prepares to affirm President-elect Joe Biden's victory, thousands of people have gathered to show their support for President Donald Trump and his claims of election fraud.

Report: Alabama OL coach Kyle Flood expected to join Steve Sarkisian at Texas,"One of the key targets for new Texas Longhorns head coach Steve Sarkisian is close to falling into place, as Chip Brown of Horns247 reported on Wednesday morning that Alabama offensive line coach Kyle Flood is expected to join Sarkisian’s staff.

Flood will also likely receive the offensive coordinator title — and a commensurate salary boost — with Sarkisian calling plays.

In Flood’s second season in Tuscaloosa, the Alabama offensive line won the Joe Moore Award on Tuesday as the best offensive line in college football this season. Quarterback Mac Jones was only sacked 12 times in 2020, once for every 42.1 dropbacks, and ranked second nationally in rushing touchdowns with 35. Senior left tackle Alex Leatherwood and redshirt senior center Landon Dickerson were both consensus All-American and leaders of an experienced group that boasted 126 career starts.

Likewise, the 2019 group was also outstanding in pass protection, surrendering just .92 sacks per game. Alabama ranked second nationally in SP+, second nationally in scoring offense, and sixth in total offense.

Flood joined the Crimson Tide after spending the 2017 and 2018 seasons coaching Sarkisian’s offensive lines with the Atlanta Falcons. In 2017, the Falcons only allowed 24 sacks.

So Flood is a coach who has now worked with Sarkisian for the last four years and clearly has his trust.

Prior to the Falcons, Flood was the head coach at Rutgers for four seasons and spent 11 total seasons on the staff in Piscataway.

One of the questions with Flood is his recruiting ability — he likely won’t recruit at the level of former offensive coordinator Tim Beck. Most of his connections are on the East Coast. As a result, expect Sarkisian to try to surround Flood with a high-level recruiter or two on the offensive staff in an attempt to approximate the formula that worked for Alabama in landing the Brockermeyer twins and other high-level offensive line prospects.","['Wescott Eberts', 'Jan']",https://news.google.com,high
Deshaun Watson tweets cryptic message after Texans reportedly hire Nick Caserio,"Not everyone in Houston seems to be happy with the Texans decision to name longtime New England Patriots executive Nick Caserio as new general manager.

Multiple reports on Tuesday confirmed that the Texans had reached an agreement to name Caserio to the position after previously firing Bill O’Brien in October.

TEXANS HIRE LONGTIME PATRIOTS EXECUTIVE NICK CASERIO AS NEW GENERAL MANAGER: REPORT

The move seemed welcomed by all, especially as it was Houston’s second attempt at locking down Caserio but just hours after news broke, Texans quarterback Deshaun Watson sent out a cryptic tweet that seemed to express disappointment with the organization's decision.

""Some things never change….,"" the tweet read.

In a busy news cycle, it’s not clear what Watson was tweeting about but the coincidence seems unlikely.

O’Brien, who served as head coach and GM before his firing, was a former offensive coordinator for the Patriots. He was joined by Jack Easterby who currently serves as the team’s executive vice president of football operations but previously worked alongside Bill Belichick in New England.

If Watson was talking about Caserio, it's clear he doesn't believe that ties to the Patriots are the answers to Houston’s problems.

The Texans wrapped up the 2020 season over the weekend with a 41-38 loss to the Tennessee Titans, closing out with a sad 4-12 record.

College basketball rankings: UConn remains at No. 26 in Top 25 And 1 after storming back to down Marquette,"UConn was down 18 points with fewer than 16 minutes to play Tuesday night on the road against a Marquette team that owns victories over Wisconsin and Creighton. The Huskies' win probability had dipped below 4%. Their two-game winning streak seemed all but snapped.

But then Tyler Polley got going and changed the game completely.

The senior forward, who entered averaging just 4.8 points per contest, scored 23 points in the second half to lead UConn to an incredible comeback that resulted in a 65-54 victory over Steve Wojciechowski's Golden Eagles. Polley had scored zero points in two of UConn's previous four games. But, in this one, he sank five of the eight 3-pointers he attempted and was the biggest reason the Huskies outscored Marquette 40-11 in the final 15:12.

""Tyler's as good a guy as you'll ever coach,"" UConn coach Dan Hurley told reporters afterward, according to the New Haven Register. ""I don't think he has a bad bone in his body. It couldn't happen to a better guy.""

Wednesday pod

The win means UConn is now 5-1 overall and 2-1 in the Big East heading into Saturday's game at Butler. It also suggests one of the biggest brands in the sport, a program that's won three of the past 16 NCAA Tournaments, is good enough in Hurley's third season to return to the NCAA Tournament for the first time since 2016. The Huskies are currently on their longest NCAA Tournament drought since the 1980s.

UConn remains No. 26 in Wednesday morning's updated CBS Sports Top 25 And 1 daily college basketball rankings. The Huskies' next scheduled game against a team that's also currently ranked is Jan. 15 against Villanova.

Wednesday's NFL injury and roster news ahead of Super Wild Card Weekend,"A day after coach Ron Rivera entertained the idea of rotating quarterbacks in Saturday's wild-card game against the Buccaneers, the Washington Football Team took steps toward making it a reality.

With Alex Smith limited by his calf strain, Washington gave backup Taylor Heinicke first-team reps on Wednesday.

""It looked like he threw the ball well,"" Rivera said of Smith after practice.

Smith, who injured the calf against the 49ers in Week 14 and missed Weeks 15-16, returned in the season finale to lead Washington to a division-winning victory over the Eagles. The 36-year-old's movement was limited throughout the contest, which contributed to his up-and-down performance.

""Tomorrow is going to be a telling day,"" Smith said in regards to the status of his injury.

Heinicke played in relief of Dwayne Haskins in the Week 16 loss to Carolina and fared well in limited action. The 27-year-old joined Washington's practice squad on Dec. 8; since going undrafted in 2015, Heinicke has had short stints with four NFL teams, including the Panthers in 2018, and in the XFL last year.

Washington running back Antonio Gibson (toe) and wide receiver Terry McLaurin (ankle) were also limited in practice.",['Around The Nfl Staff'],https://news.google.com,high
No surprise: Peyton Manning a Hall of Fame finalist,"Peyton Manning, no surprise, is among 15 finalists for the Pro Football Hall of Fame's class of 2021.

The star quarterback, owner of a record five NFL Most Valuable Player awards and two Super Bowl titles, was the first finalist revealed by the hall on Tuesday night.

Manning, of course, was one of the most prolific passers in NFL history. In 18 pro seasons and 265 starts out of 266 games played since being the top overall draft choice by Indianapolis in 1998, he had 14 seasons with 4,000-plus yards passing.

When he retired following leading Denver to the 2015 league title, Manning held NFL records for career passing yards (71,940), career passing touchdowns (539) and consecutive seasons with at least 25 passing touchdowns (13).

He won 201 of those games, including playoffs, guiding the Colts to the 2006 NFL championship. He also made the Super Bowl for the 2009 and 2013 seasons, was a seven-time All-Pro, and a member of the NFL’s All-Decade Team of the 2000s.

Joining Manning as a finalist was one of the players he threw to, wide receiver Reggie Wayne, a finalist for the second time. First-year eligible Calvin Johnson and second-time finalist Torry Holt also made the cut among receivers.

Wayne played in two Super Bowls with Manning.

Four defensive backs, including current 49ers general manager John Lynch, advanced. This will be Lynch’s eighth time as a finalist, while it’s the first for Charles Woodson in his initial year of eligibility, and Ronde Barber, and the second for appearance in the finals for Leroy Butler.

""I am just enjoying this moment, sitting here watching those highlights and what you immediately do is kind of reliving some of those moments,"" Woodson said. ""To me it is not lost to be in this moment, to be a Hall of Fame finalist in the first year; it takes a lot to get to this point. You really have to make an impact on the game and I am excited to be in this moment.""

Two of the NFL’s most dependable defensive linemen got to the finals: sack master Jared Allen and versatile Richard Seymour. Allen, who had 136 sacks and forced four safeties, is another first-year eligible player, while Seymour has made the finals for three of his four eligible years.

Zach Thomas, who also excelled on special teams, was one of three linebackers making the finals, joining Sam Mills — a star in the USFL and then the NFL — and Clay Matthews, who led some strong Cleveland defenses from 1978-1993 before playing three season in Atlanta. Thomas and Mills became second-time finalists, and Matthews for the first time.

Two offensive linemen who have been frequent finalists round out the potential class of 2021: Alan Faneca and Tony Boselli. Faneca, who played guard and tackle and starred for three franchises (Steelers, Jets, Cardinals) made his sixth final in as many years of eligibility, while Boselli, a standout for Jacksonville, reached the finals for a fifth time.

"You Can Catch Jupiter, Saturn, and Mercury Taking Over the Night Sky This Weekend","Odds are that when you gaze at the night sky, you're looking up to see the stars. But if you peer out this weekend, you'll likely see something more unexpected: a triple conjunction of planets. According to Good News Network, Jupiter, Saturn, and Mercury will come together to form a triangle on January 10. As for the best time to spot this phenomenon? You can catch the planets arranging into the triangle shape 45 minutes after sunset as you look at the southwest horizon.

While it's recommended to grab a pair of binoculars if you'd like to clearly see the three planets, which will be just about one-and-a-half degrees apart, you will also notice them by their brightness. Space notes that Mercury will seem two-and-a-half times dimmer than Jupiter, but the planet will be four times brighter than Saturn.

This isn't the only planet-related news to kick off the new year. You may have noticed that your days seem to be flying by faster than usual. There's a good reason why: The Earth is spinning faster than it has in 50 years—meaning your days are less than 24 hours. Daily Mail reported that this all started last year on July 19. Scientists recorded this as the shortest day—measured at 1.4602 milliseconds shorter than 24 hours—since they began analyzing days in the 1960s.",['Nashia Baker'],https://news.google.com,high
The Autonomous-Car Chaos of the 2004 Darpa Grand Challenge,"When the inquisition required him to drop his study of what the Roman Catholic Church insisted was not a heliocentric solar system, Galileo Galilei turned his energy to the less controversial question of how to stick a telescope onto a helmet. The king of Spain had offered a hefty reward to anyone who could solve the stubborn mystery of how to determine a ship’s longitude while at sea: 6,000 ducats up front and another 2,000 per year for life. Galileo thought his headgear, with the telescope fixed over one eye and making its wearer look like a misaligned unicorn, would net him the reward.

Determining latitude is easy for any sailor who can pick out the North Star, but finding longitude escaped the citizens of the 17th century, because it required a precise knowledge of time. That’s based on a simple principle: Say you set your clock before sailing west from Greenwich. Say when the sun hits its apex, the clock reads five hours past noon. Because you know the earth rotates 15 degrees per hour—completing the 360 in 24 hours—you know you’re 75 degrees west of London. Easy peasy. That only works, though, if you have a clock that can keep accurate time, which nobody sailing the high seas then did. Clocks were complex mechanical devices, ill-suited to sea voyages. The rolling oceans messed with the pendulums that kept time on land. Salt air messed with everything. So explorers increasingly interested in crossing the oceans had a dangerously limited understanding of where they were.

Galileo’s solution lay with the incessant eclipses of what he called Jupiter’s four moons (and what astronomers now call Jupiter’s Galilean moons, having since discovered 75 more). In 1612, Galileo realized he could use the movement of the moons, which he charted, as a sort of astronomical clock. Over the next century, this became a common way of determining longitude on land. But it didn’t work on the ocean. The telescopes of Galileo’s age had tiny fields of view, and finding and tracking things that are at least 365 million miles away was virtually impossible on a ship bouncing along the waves. Galileo thought that by wearing the telescope on his face, a navigator could counteract that pitching and rolling more easily, and keep his focus on Jupiter’s moons.

The Spanish were unimpressed, and no one ever claimed the king’s ducats. Then, in 1714, British Parliament passed the Longitude Act, offering £20,000 for a solution. After decades of trial and error, working-class clockmaker John Harrison presented the marine chronometer, a time-keeping device that could withstand the rigors of the seafaring life and keep its practitioners on the maps they were filling in as they went along.

That successful iteration of the longitude prize was what Tony Tether, the director of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, had in mind when he concocted the 2004 Grand Challenge: a way to motivate the Harrisons of the world as well as the Galileis.

DARPA was the secretive arm of the Pentagon that had birthed the internet, GPS, and the stealth bomber. In the early 2000s, it turned its gaze to autonomous vehicles that could keep US soldiers out of harm’s way. Frustrated by the slow progress by the defense contractors and university labs that had spent decades on the problem, Tether tried something new: a race for autonomous vehicles, through the Mojave Desert, open to anyone. The $1 million prize and the audacity of the challenge drew in all sorts of hopefuls. Esteemed roboticists, university and high school students, hobbyist tinkerers, BattleBots veterans. What they lacked in experience with autonomous machines they made up for in enthusiasm. They spent the year leading up to race day sacrificing sleep, social contact, and in one case, $50,000 in Jeopardy! winnings to the Grand Challenge. A qualifying round slimmed an original field of 86 teams to 15 finalists.","['Alex Davies', 'Alex Davie']",https://news.google.com,high
How Earth's oddest mammal got to be so bizarre,"Credit: Unsplash/CC0 Public Domain

Often considered the world's oddest mammal, Australia's beaver-like, duck-billed platypus exhibits an array of bizarre characteristics: it lays eggs instead of giving birth to live babies, sweats milk, has venomous spurs and is even equipped with 10 sex chromosomes. Now, an international team of researchers led by University of Copenhagen has conducted a unique mapping of the platypus genome and found answers regarding the origins of a few of its stranger features.

It lays eggs, but nurses, it is toothless, has a venomous spur, has webbed feet, fur that glows and has 10 sex chromosomes. Ever since Europeans discovered the platypus in Australia during the late 1700's, the quirky, duck-billed, semi-aquatic creature has baffled scientific researchers.

Modern day researchers are still trying to understand how the platypus—often considered to be the world's oddest mammal—got to be so unique. Their understandings have now advanced, to a great degree. For the first time, an international team of researchers, led by University of Copenhagen biologists, has mapped a complete platypus genome. The study is published in the scientific journal, Nature.

""The complete genome has provided us with the answers to how a few of the platypus' bizarre features emerged. At the same time, decoding the genome for platypus is important for improving our understanding of how other mammals evolved—including us humans. It holds the key as to why we and other eutheria mammals evolved to become animals that give birth to live young instead of egg-laying animals,"" explains Professor Guojie Zhang of the Department of Biology.

The platypus belongs to an ancient group of mammals—monotremes—which existed millions of years prior to the emergence of any modern-day mammal.

""Indeed, the platypus belongs to the Mammalia class. But genetically, it is a mixture of mammals, birds and reptiles. It has preserved many of its ancestors' original features—which probably contribute to its success in adapting to the environment they live in,"" says Professor Zhang.

Lays eggs, sweats milk and has no teeth

One of the platypus' most unusual characteristics is that, while it lays eggs, it also has mammary glands used to feed its babies, not through nipples, but by milk—which is sweat from its body.

During our own evolution, we humans lost all three so-called vitellogenin genes, each of which is important for the production of egg yolks. Chickens on the other hand, continue to have all three. The study demonstrates that platypuses still carry one of these three vitellogenin genes, despite having lost the other two roughly 130 million years ago. The platypus continues to lay eggs by virtue of this one remaining gene. This is probably because it is not as dependent on creating yolk proteins as birds and reptiles are, as platypuses produce milk for their young.

In all other mammals, vitellogenin genes have been replaced with casein genes, which are responsible for our ability to produce casein protein, a major component in mammalian milk. The new research demonstrates that the platypus carries casein genes as well, and that the composition of their milk is thereby quite similar to that of cows, humans and other mammals.

""It informs us that milk production in all extant mammal species has been developed through the same set of genes derived from a common ancestor which lived more than 170 million years ago—alongside the early dinosaurs in the Jurassic period,"" says Guojie Zhang.

Another trait that makes the platypus so unique is that, unlike the vast majority of mammals, it is toothless. Although this monotremes' nearest ancestors were toothed, the modern platypus is equipped with two horn plates that are used to mash food. The study reveals that the platypus lost its teeth roughly 120 million years ago, when four of the eight genes responsible for tooth development disappeared.

Only animal with 10 sex chromosomes

Yet another platypus oddity investigated by the researchers was how their sex is determined. Both humans and every other mammal on Earth have two sex chromosomes that determine sex—the X and Y chromosome system in which XX is female and XY is male. The monotremes, however, including our duck-billed friends from Down Under, have 10 sex chromosomes, with five Y and five X chromosomes.

Thanks to the near-complete chromosomal level genomes, researchers can now suggest that these 10 sex chromosomes in the ancestors of the monotremes were organized in a ring form which was later broken away into many small pieces of X and Y chromosomes. At the same time, the genome mapping reveals that the majority of monotreme sex chromosomes have more in common with chickens than with humans. But what it shows, is an evolutionary link between mammals and birds.

U.S. officials report more severe allergic reactions to COVID-19 vaccines,"FILE PHOTO: Medical staff member receives the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine at Jackson Memorial Hospital in Miami, Florida, U.S., December 15, 2020. REUTERS/Marco Bello

(Reuters) - The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said on Wednesday it is carefully monitoring allergic reactions to the coronavirus vaccines from Pfizer Inc and Moderna Inc and urged individuals who had a serious reaction not to get the second dose.

In a conference call with reporters, the U.S. public health agency said allergic reactions are occurring at a rate of 11.1 per 1 million vaccinations. That compared with flu vaccines, in which such reactions occur at a rate of 1.3 per 1 million shots.

The severe reactions are still “exceedingly rare,” they said, stressing the need for people to get vaccinated when the shots become available to them, given the threat of death and serious disease from the coronavirus that has already claimed more than 357,000 lives in the United States alone.

The CDC said it is monitoring allergic reaction incidents closely and plans to post weekly updates on its website.

The agency is also urging that venues that deliver the vaccine be prepared not only to recognize serious allergic reactions, known as anaphylaxis, but be trained on how to treat them and recognize when individuals need to be referred to hospitals for additional care.

CDC officials said 28 people who received the coronavirus vaccine developed by Pfizer and BioNTech had severe allergic reactions. They also noted one case of anaphylaxis, which can cause throat swelling and breathing difficulty, after an individual received Moderna’s vaccine.

Officials attributed the difference largely to the fact that the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine was authorized earlier than the Moderna shot, and said the precautions apply to both.

A study published on Wednesday in the CDC’s weekly report on death and disease looking at cases between Dec. 14 and Dec. 23, identified 21 cases of anaphylaxis after the administration of 1,893,360 doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine. Of these, 71%occurred within the first 15 minutes after vaccine administration.

Britain’s medical regulator has said that anyone with a history of anaphylaxis, or severe allergic reactions to a medicine or food, should not be given the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine.","['Manas Mishra', 'Julie Steenhuysen']",https://news.google.com,high
U.S. tops 21 million COVID-19 cases with record hospitalizations as states ramp up vaccinations,"NEW YORK (Reuters) -More Americans were hospitalized with COVID-19 on Wednesday than at any time since the pandemic began, as total coronavirus infections crossed the 21 million mark, deaths soared across much of the United States and a historic vaccination effort lagged.

FILE PHOTO: A mobile field hospital is shown outside UCI Medical Center during the outbreak of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Orange, California, U.S., January 4, 2021. REUTERS/Mike Blake

U.S. COVID-19 hospitalizations reached a record 130,834 late on Tuesday, according to a Reuters tally of public health data, while 3,684 reported fatalities was the second-highest single-day death toll of the pandemic.

That appalling toll meant that on Tuesday someone died from COVID-19 every 24 seconds in the United States. With total deaths surpassing 357,000, one in every 914 U.S. residents has died from COVID-19 since the pandemic began, according to a Reuters analysis.

In hard-hit California, public health authorities ordered hospitals in more than a dozen southern and central counties overwhelmed with COVID-19 patients to suspend elective surgeries for at least three weeks.

The order, issued late on Tuesday by the state’s Department of Public Health, applies to 14 counties, including Los Angeles, Orange and San Diego counties, where hospital critical care capacity has been severely stretched.

Total U.S. COVID-19 cases surpassed the 21 million mark on Wednesday, and, with many healthcare systems approaching a breaking point, pressure mounted on state and local officials to speed up distribution of the two authorized vaccines from Pfizer Inc with partner BioNTech SE and Moderna Inc.

The lack of a federal blueprint for the crucial final step of getting the vaccines into tens of millions of arms has left state and local officials in charge of the monumental effort, creating a patchwork of different plans across United States.

VACCINE MEGA HUBS AND THE NATIONAL GUARD

Some states have summoned extra resources to speed vaccine administrations. North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper on Tuesday mobilized the state’s National Guard to “provide support to local health providers” to more quickly distribute coronavirus vaccines.

“We will use all resources and personnel needed,” Cooper said in a statement.

Maryland Governor Larry Hogan also announced that emergency support teams from the state’s National Guard will lend a hand to local health departments in their vaccination efforts.

“At the current pace of allocation,” Hogan said, the state expects to be able to start vaccinating the 1b priority group - people age 75 and older and frontline essential workers - by late January.

In New York City, where Mayor Bill de Blasio and Governor Andrew Cuomo have sparred over slow vaccine administration, officials said on Wednesday the city was ramping up its “vaccine hubs,” which would include 15 locations by Jan. 16, five “mega sites” among them. The sites will have the capacity to vaccinate 100,000 New Yorkers a week, official said.

The ambitious goal comes as the city administered roughly 10,000 shots on Tuesday, according to data posted on Wednesday.

De Blasio also said at a news briefing that home health aides and some members of the New York Police Department could receive the vaccine for the first time on Wednesday.

After earlier this week laying blame on local officials for the sluggish pace of vaccinations at some New York hospitals, Cuomo said on Wednesday that the rate among hospital staff statewide has tripled to 30,000 inoculations per day since Monday.

In Florida, which set a new single-day record of coronavirus cases, Ron DeSantis announced that the Hard Rock stadium in Miami’s metropolitan area was converting its testing operations into a vaccination center.

Another 3 million doses of the two vaccines were sent to U.S. states on Tuesday, acting Secretary of Defense Christopher Miller said in a statement, bringing the total to more than 19 million doses in 21 days, only a fraction of which have been administered so far.

Both authorized vaccines require two doses three or four weeks apart. Healthcare workers in several states this week began getting their second dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, which was approved before the Moderna shot.

The U.S. government was considering halving the doses of Moderna’s vaccine to free up supply for more vaccinations. But scientists at Moderna and the National Institutes of Health said it could take two months to study whether the halved doses would be effective.

Meanwhile, CVS Health Corp said on Wednesday it expected to complete administering the first doses of COVID-19 vaccines at nearly 8,000 U.S. nursing homes by Jan. 25.

A massive global vaccination campaign will be needed to establish a level of herd immunity that could put an end to the devastating pandemic raging across much of the United States and many other countries, with more highly transmissible variants of the virus cropping up.

A variant that has swept through the United Kingdom has been reported in at least five U.S. states, National Institutes of Health Director Francis Collins said in an interview with the Washington Post on Wednesday.

“We have now seen that same UK virus in the U.S. in at least five states, and I would be surprised if that doesn’t grow pretty rapidly,” Collins said, adding, however, that it doesn’t seem to be more severe.","['Maria Caspani', 'Peter Szekely']",https://news.google.com,high
Maricopa County to enter Phase 1B of coronavirus vaccinations next week,"PHOENIX – Maricopa County is moving to the next phase of COVID-19 vaccinations next week, expanding access to teachers, police and elderly people.

Scheduling for phase 1B prioritized individuals in metro Phoenix will open up Monday through the county’s registration system, according to the Maricopa County Public Health website.

The prioritized portion of 1B consists of K-12 school staff and childcare workers, law enforcement and protective services personnel and people age 75 and older.

The rest of phase 1B, which consists of adults living in congregate settings and certain essential workers — will be next up after the prioritized groups.

At first, the next phase of shots will be given at the county’s point of distribution sites that aren’t already fully booked with phase 1A people getting their second doses of the vaccine.

The number of available appointments will be limited because of vaccine scarcity. More slots and locations will be opened when more doses become available.

People in phase 1A who haven’t been vaccinated will still be able to register during the next phase but will no longer have priority status.

On Wednesday morning, Maricopa County reported having administered 62,068 doses to individuals in phase 1A of the distribution plan.

Two Arizona counties, Gila and Pinal, are already in phase 1B.

Yuma County has announced that it will move into 1B on Monday, while Pima County said it was aiming for the end of next week.

Arizona’s vaccine distribution began Dec. 16. Through Tuesday, the state had administered 119,653 doses, according to the Arizona Department of Health Services.

With millions of people prioritized for phases 1A, 1B and 1C, state officials have said they don’t expect vaccines to be available to the general public until March or April.

COVID outbreak linked to Christmas tree costume at San Jose hospital has now spread to 60 workers,"The COVID-19 outbreak at a San Jose hospital linked to an inflatable Christmas tree costume has now spread to at least 60 people.

Kaiser Permanente has said it is investigating if the outfit worn by an emergency department employee on Christmas Day might have caused the spread that has killed one.

'This was not a Kaiser Permanente sponsored or approved activity,' the spokesperson said in a statement.

'Any exposure, if it occurred, would have been completely innocent, and quite accidental, as the individual had no Covid symptoms and only sought to lift the spirits of those around them during what is a very stressful time.'

Kaiser had reported 44 cases potentially linked to the costume but revised the figure late Tuesday. All 60 workers now testing positive were in the ER on Christmas Day, The Mercury News reports.

The hospital is now probing whether the air-powered costume, which had big eyes, a smile, and a bright red nose may have fanned the spread of virus-laden droplets.

DailyMail.com has contacted the hospital to find out what has happened to the costume since it was linked to the outbreak.

California is so swamped by the coronavirus pandemic that the state has ordered hospitals with room to accept patients from others that have maxed out on intensive care beds.

The giant inflatable Christmas tree costume linked with spreading COVID-19 to at least 43 California hospital staff, killing one, has been pictured on the wards

A colleague at the hospital who was working the morning of the incident told Mercury News the woman had wanted to provide some 'innocent' festive relief to her coworkers and patients.

'She was just spreading joy,' the nurse who did not want to be named told the outlet.

The nurse said her colleague had surprised everyone at the central nurses station at the emergency department by appearing dressed in the costume sometime between 9 a.m. and 10 a.m. December 25.

'You just see this Christmas tree coming bounding down towards you, and it makes you smile. It was a brief moment of levity, and you get back to working,' she recalled.

The nurse said she stayed six feet from the woman in the costume in line with social distancing guidelines and that she was wearing a mask and a face shield alongside everyone else in the emergency department.

She told how the festive gesture had been 'spur of the moment' and insisted that previous reports of a party or gathering of people around the woman in the costume were incorrect.

'[They] painted us in a light of being irresponsible when we've been working our butts off to save lives. We're not seeing our families. It portrayed us as not caring about our community,' she said.

She added that all staff wear masks and 'don't hug' and that no one wore Santa hats in the ER this year in case they got in the way of PPE.

But on December 27, two days after the brief merriment, the nurse said she started showing symptoms of COVID-19.

Many colleagues working Christmas Day also began feeling ill and showing symptoms around the same time, she added.

The woman wearing the costume had no symptoms on Christmas Day but later also tested positive.

A nurse has leaped to the defense of her colleague who wore a Christmas Tree costume now linked to a COVID-19 outbreak that killed one and infected 44 at a California hospital (above)

The unidentified hospital employee wore the novelty air-powered inflatable costume on the wards at the Kaiser Permanente San Jose Medical Center on Christmas Day

NBC Bay Area news, which first reported the incident, said the deceased was a registration clerk described by her co-workers as an 'absolutely wonderful woman.'

They quoted one employee as saying the outbreak may actually have been caused by staff carrying out respiratory treatments in a room not designed for that purpose.

The coronavirus is primarily spread through respiratory droplets emitted when people breathe, speak, sing, cough or sneeze.

Although hospital employees have begun to receive their Covid-19 vaccines, it takes around two weeks after the first dose for the body to have enough antibodies to fight off infection, and both vaccines authorized so far in the US require a booster shot.

Kaiser Permante said that staff who received their first dose less than 10 days ago would therefore not be expected to have reached immunity at the time of the exposure.

The hospital offered employees expedited testing, carried out a deep clean of the emergency room and adjusted its protocols, including ending large gatherings in break rooms, it said.

The nurse added that she was struggling to get her head around the idea that the costume could have sparked the cluster of cases.

'It just doesn't seem completely plausible that it was all her because it was just a moment in time compared to what we deal with all the time,' the nurse said.

'How could it be that if this occurred at 9 in the morning that people were being infected at three o'clock in the afternoon? Could this happen? Yes. But was it tragically coincidental or something else? We just don't know.'

Irene Chavez, senior vice president and area manager, Kaiser Permanente San Jose Medical Center said in a statement that it was 'a highly unusual situation involving a well-intentioned staff member acting on their own without advance notice or approval'.

'Any exposure, if it occurred, would have been completely innocent, and quite accidental, as the individual had no COVID symptoms and only sought to lift the spirits of those around them during what is a very stressful time,' she said.

'Obviously, we will no longer allow air-powered costumes at our facilities,' Chavez said.

'At the same time, we are taking steps to reinforce safety precautions among staff, including physical distancing and no gathering in break rooms, no sharing of food or beverages, and masks at all times,' the hospital said, as per ABC7.

Dr. Peter Chin-Hong, a professor of medicine and infectious disease expert at UCSF said the costume was likely 'acting as the mover of air in a huge way. It's like a fan that's kind of multidirectional and random.'

The hospital is currently conducting contact tracing to determine if other staff, patients or visitors may have been exposed to the virus.

It has also introduced weekly testing for its staff.

The hospital's emergency department is still open and safe to receive patients and all areas of the department are undergoing a deep cleaning, while those infected go into isolation.

Nearly 40,000 health care workers at Kaiser Permanente have already received COVID-19 vaccines and more are anticipated soon.

Los Angeles continues to see hospitalizations rise day after day, setting a new record Tuesday with almost 8,000 hospitalized and more than a fifth of those in ICU. The county, which accounts for a quarter of California’s 40 million residents, has more than 40% of the state’s 27,000 coronavirus deaths.","['Lauren Fruen', 'Rachel Sharp', 'Marlene Lenthang For Dailymail.Com']",https://news.google.com,high
Early High-Titer Plasma Therapy to Prevent Severe Covid-19 in Older Adults,"Trial Design and Oversight

We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial between June 4, 2020, and October 25, 2020 (when the last patient completed follow-up), at clinical sites and geriatric units in Argentina. The trial was approved by the institutional review boards of the participating institutions and the state of Buenos Aires and was supervised by an independent data and safety monitoring board. The authors who designed the trial and wrote the manuscript are listed in Table S15 in the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org. All the authors compiled the data and vouch for the accuracy and completeness of the data and the adherence of the trial to the protocol, available at NEJM.org. Three of the authors analyzed the data. The last author wrote the first draft of the manuscript. No one who is not an author contributed to the writing of the manuscript. No confidentiality agreements related to the data are in place between the sponsors and the authors or their institutions.

Trial Patients

Patients who were 75 years of age or older, irrespective of current coexisting conditions, or between 65 and 74 years of age with at least one coexisting condition were identified and assessed for eligibility. Coexisting conditions, which are defined in Table S1, included hypertension or diabetes for which the patient was currently receiving pharmacologic treatment, obesity, chronic renal failure, cardiovascular disease, and COPD. At the time of screening for SARS-CoV-2 by reverse-transcriptase–polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assay, eligible patients had had at least one of each sign or symptom in the following two categories for less than 48 hours: a temperature of at least 37.5°C, unexplained sweating, or chills; and dry cough, dyspnea, fatigue, myalgia, anorexia, sore throat, dysgeusia, anosmia, or rhinorrhea. Exclusion criteria included severe respiratory disease (the primary end point), any disease listed in Table S5, or both.

Patients who provided consent to undergo screening received home visits, and samples of nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal secretions were obtained for testing with an RT-PCR assay (iAMP COVID-19, Atila BioSystems) to detect SARS-CoV-2. Patients with detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA were transported to trial hospitals and invited to sign the informed-consent form. After July 22, 2020, legal guardians provided consent for patients who had cognitive impairment. Starting on July 27, 2020, since several geriatric institutions with SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks were transformed into low-complexity inpatient units for mildly ill residents infected with SARS-CoV-2, we screened and invited residents who met the trial criteria to participate in the trial on-site.

Randomization and Intervention

Eligible patients who provided written informed consent were randomly assigned to receive either 250 ml of convalescent plasma with an IgG titer greater than 1:1000 against SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein (COVIDAR IgG, Instituto Leloir, Argentina) or 250 ml of placebo (0.9% normal saline). The convalescent plasma was arbitrarily defined as “high-titer” and included antibody concentrations in the upper 28th percentile. A computer-generated randomization sequence with a balanced permuted block design (block size 2) was prepared at the data center.

Convalescent plasma or placebo was administered less than 72 hours after the onset of symptoms, and the infusions were given over a period of 1.5 to 2.0 hours. Both the convalescent plasma and placebo were concealed with opaque bags and tape to cover the infusion catheter. Patients were monitored for adverse events until 12 hours after the intervention.

A total of 479 potential plasma donors who had had SARS-CoV-2 infection for a minimum of 10 days and who had been asymptomatic for 3 days or longer and had two negative RT-PCR tests17 were identified through hospital lists and an online campaign. Potential donors who provided written informed consent were visited at home and screened for SARS-CoV-2 S IgG at a titer greater than 1:1000 in serum. Each of the 135 candidates (28%) with adequate titers donated 750 ml of plasma (see Fig. S6).

Clinical and Laboratory Monitoring

A total of 24 hours after the end of the infusion, a sample of venous blood (5 ml) was obtained from the patients. Serum samples were preserved at −20°C until completion of the trial. We assayed anti–S IgG SARS-CoV-2 using the COVIDAR IgG test. In addition, we assayed samples using the SARS-CoV-2 Spike S1-RBD IgG enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay detection kit (GenScript) and the SARS-CoV-2 surrogate virus neutralization test kit (GenScript).

The patients’ clinical status was monitored daily by trial physicians until day 15 to assess for primary end-point events that occurred in the hospital, in participating geriatric institutions, or at home if the patients had been discharged (Figs. S7 and S8). Patients who had persistent symptoms for which medical care was warranted were followed until the resolution of symptoms or for a maximum of 25 days to assess for secondary end-point events. The trial physicians used predesigned questionnaires to collect clinical information. None of the patients received any experimental therapy for Covid-19 besides convalescent plasma. Data were recorded on paper forms and then double-entered into an electronic database.

Trial End Points

The primary end point of the trial was the development of severe respiratory disease, defined as a respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute or more, an oxygen saturation of less than 93% while the patient was breathing ambient air, or both. Patients were assessed for this end-point event between 12 hours after the infusion of convalescent plasma or placebo and day 15 of trial participation.

Prespecified secondary clinical end points were life-threatening respiratory disease (defined as oxygen supplementation at a fraction of inspired oxygen [Fio 2 ] of 100%, noninvasive or invasive ventilation, admission to an intensive care unit, or any combination of these), critical systemic illness (respiratory failure with a ratio of the partial pressure of oxygen to Fio 2 ≤200 mm Hg, shock, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, or any combination of these), and death associated with Covid-19. Patients in whom the illness had not resolved were assessed for these end-point events until day 25 of trial participation. On July 22, 2020, we amended the protocol to include a fourth secondary end point that included any of the three secondary end points described above, alone or in combination.

Early Trial Termination

The trial was initiated when the number of cases of Covid-19 in Buenos Aires was high. However, as the number of cases decreased, it became clear that it would take approximately 5 months to reach the enrollment goal. Consequently, after discussions with the data and safety monitoring board and enrollment of 76% of the target population, we decided that it would be logistically impossible and ethically questionable, given the daily cost of the pandemic in lives and illness, to continue the trial, and we stopped to examine the results.

Statistical Analysis

Given the complexity of implementing this intervention, the minimal clinically important difference was set at a 40% relative reduction for an expected 50% of the patients in the placebo group and 30% of the patients in the convalescent plasma group who would have a primary end-point event. We estimated that a total sample size of 210 patients (105 per trial group) would provide the trial with 80% power to detect a between-group difference, at a significance level of α=0.05. We used a two-sided z-test of proportions with continuity correction and one planned interim analysis with the O’Brien–Fleming spending function to determine the test boundaries.

In the intention-to-treat analysis, the end points were assessed from the time of randomization. Continuous variables are presented as means and standard deviations or medians and interquartile ranges, as appropriate, and categorical variables are presented as percentages.

In the primary analysis strategy, we used the Kaplan–Meier product limit estimates to compare the time to reach the primary end point in the trial groups. An estimate of the relative risk and 95% confidence interval was also reported. A modified intention-to-treat analysis excluded patients who became ineligible between randomization and the administration of convalescent plasma or placebo.

The protocol prespecified an evaluation of IgG protection correlates and a subgroup analysis that was suggested by the data and safety monitoring board and approved by the institutional review boards on November 2, 2020. This analysis included an evaluation of end-point events in patients who were 75 years of age or older, irrespective of coexisting conditions, and in those between 65 and 74 years of age who had at least one coexisting condition.","['Romina', 'Gonzalo', 'Pérez Marc', 'Diego', 'Silvina', 'Alejandra', 'Virginia', 'Ignacio', 'Mauricio T.', 'Cristian']",https://news.google.com,high
"Central Valley hospitals brace for oxygen shortages, lack of space for bodies","Officials in Fresno County are scrambling for oxygen-making machines to care for the rising tide of those sick with COVID-19, as the number of bodies has placed greater pressure on funeral homes.

Officials in California’s 10th most populous county say the situation is not as severe as that in Los Angeles County. But health authorities officials are seeking to ease pressure on hospitals by sending home COVID-19 patients who would normally stay in the hospital — and to do so, they’re searching for machines that can generate oxygen for patients at home.

“It’s a very grave scenario to make that decision,” said Fresno County interim health officer Dr. Rais Vohra. “Because under normal conditions, under ideal conditions, everyone who needs oxygen would be admitted to the hospital. Unfortunately, we’re operating in a disaster and so we don’t have that luxury, and we have to make really hard choices and do the best that we can.”

Vohra said he was on the hunt to track down some oxygen concentrators — machines that can create oxygen out of air. “We’re trying to do as much as we can to track down the supplies that will be needed just to prepare ourselves for an even larger number of patient volumes in the weeks to come.”

The demand for oxygen is critical.

“A lot of people just need oxygen in order to get through this,” Vohra said. These are patients who have pneumonia and are able to walk, but need a tube of oxygen flowing at a high rate plugged into their nose to avoid becoming critically ill.

At the moment, it’s hard to scale up a program that can accommodate perhaps hundreds of patients a day to be set up for home-oxygen treatment. But that’s what they’re trying to do, Vohra said.

Fresno County is the most populous county in the San Joaquin Valley, one of the most productive agricultural areas of the country. But like Southern California, the San Joaquin Valley has been hit hard by the pandemic, and its available intensive care unit capacity is 0%.

And in this county of nearly 1 million people, there were only 11 available intensive care unit beds on Tuesday. That means many critically ill patients have had to remain in the emergency room when they should be in the ICU, Vohra said.

“There’s other places within the hospital that they’re trying to make space for critical care patients,” Vohra said. Less critically ill patients may need to be cared for outdoors, in the tents set up in the parking lot.

The coming weeks are a source of worry. Already, there are intermittent times at which patients in ambulances are waiting several hours before being allowed into the emergency department. Ambulance staff are trying to redirect people who don’t have a true emergency to a primary care doctor or urgent care center.

“I’m very worried that we are going to see an uptick in the number of hospitalizations and deaths,” considering the big gatherings that occurred over the holidays, Vohra said. “We haven’t really seen a letup of the surge that we’ve already seen. ... There really hasn’t been a reprieve. And so, we’re certainly just waiting and bracing ourselves to see what the next couple of weeks brings.”

Within the hospitals in Fresno County, officials report they’re still able to adequately provide oxygen through the existing infrastructure; they’ve received help from American Ambulance, a company that provides ambulance service in the county, which has machines to generate oxygen and refill tanks.

But Vohra said that what’s happening in L.A. is a cautionary tale about how infrastructure can easily become overwhelmed.

“We know — because Los Angeles is experiencing this — that the demand could ... overwhelm our ability to meet people’s demands,” Vohra said. Some hospitals are under pressure because of the significant volume of patients, “the inability to find spaces for them,” and limited staffing.

Funeral homes in Fresno County are also under pressure. Mortuaries have had to figure out ways to maximize storage space for the increasing numbers of the dead, Vohra said, and mobile refrigeration units have been called in to store some bodies.

“This is a mass casualty, a mass fatality event that our county is experiencing. And we’ve had to expand the storage areas for the dead bodies here in Fresno County beyond what’s normal,” Vohra said.

Whether the county will need to resort using two refrigerated trailers being sent by state officials depends on how fast funeral homes and mortuaries can process bodies, Vohra said.

“It’s going to take that whole ecosystem to try to figure out how best to work through this really large number of bodies that they have to get taken care of,” Vohra said. “I’m glad that those two trucks are coming, and I sure hope that we don’t need them.”

Fresno County has had one of the highest death rates per capita in the last week of any county in California over the past seven days, ranked 12th of the 58 counties. Since Dec. 1, 230 COVID-19 deaths have been reported in Fresno County, nearly one-third of the cumulative total of 711 deaths recorded over the last 10 months.","['Rong-Gong Lin Ii Is A Metro Reporter Based In San Francisco Who Specializes In Covering Statewide Earthquake Safety Issues', 'The Pandemic.

"Covid-19: Smoking DOUBLES risk of hospitalisation, study says","Smoking doubles the risk of developing a severe case of coronavirus and needing hospitalisation, a new study claims.

The research provides the first conclusive evidence, based on real-world data, that being a smoker puts individuals at higher risk of severe disease than non-smokers.

It found smokers are 14 per cent more likely to have the three main symptoms of coronavirus: fever, persistent cough and shortness of breath.

But smokers are also at 50 per cent greater risk of developing more than ten symptoms at once — including cough, fever, loss of smell, loss of appetite, diarrhoea, fatigue, confusion or muscle pain — than people who do not smoke.

Development of myriad symptoms is often an indicator of more severe infection, experts believe.

The data was gathered from millions of Britons via the King's College London app ZOE.

The findings, published in the BMJ journal Thorax, fly in the face of previous studies, many of which have found smokers are less likely to catch the coronavirus or get severely ill.

Academics have been left baffled by the data, given that decades of research has found smoking tobacco increases the risk of deadly diseases such as lung cancer, strokes and diabetes.

But as the pandemic has progressed fresh research has emerged which shows smokers who catch Covid-19 are more likely to see their disease rapidly progress and lead to death.

There have been conflicting reports on the impact of smoking on a Covid patient's prognosis, with some studies finding it reduces risk, and others finding the opposite. Now, data from KCL shows smokers are twice as likely to be hospitalised than non-smokers

Dr Mario Falchi, lead researcher and Senior Lecturer at King's College London said: 'Some reports have suggested a protective effect of smoking on COVID-19 risk.

'However, studies in this area can easily be affected by biases in sampling, participation and response. Our results clearly show that smokers are at increased risk of suffering from a wider range of COVID-19 symptoms than non-smokers.'

The latest study from KCL provides real information on patients living with Covid, and looked at both self-reported cases and lab-confirmed cases.

Data from the app shows that, of the 2.4million participants who downloaded ZOE between March 24 and April 23 last year, 220,135 were smokers – around 11 per cent.

Smoking e-cigarettes increases risk of Covid-19 diagnosis by 500% A study by Stanford University academics assessed the relationship between Covid-19 and smoking. This piece of research aimed to assess whether youth cigarette and electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) use are associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) symptoms. An online national survey of 4,351 adolescents and young adults aged 13–24 years was conducted in May 2020. COVID-19 diagnosis was five times more likely e-cigarette smokers. It was seven times more likely in people who smoked both. 'There are a number of potential reasons why both dual use and e-cigarette use were associated with getting infected with COVID-19,' the researchers write. 'Heightened exposure to nicotine and other chemicals in e-cigarettes adversely affects lung function, with studies showing that lung damage caused by e-cigarettes is comparable to combustible cigarettes.'

This is slightly lower than the UK-wide average of 14 per cent of the population being smokers but was representative, the researchers say.

Participants submitted various pieces of data about themselves, any symptoms that emerged as well, and any positive lab results.

Self-reported data is less reliable, but at this early stage of the pandemic the testing capacity was a fraction of what it is now and was only available in hospitals.

Claire Steves, lead researcher, consultant physician and Reader at King's College London, said: 'As rates of COVID-19 continue to rise and the NHS edges towards capacity, it's important to do all we can to reduce its effects and find ways to reduce hospital admissions.

'Our analysis shows that smoking increases a person's likelihood to attend hospitals, so stopping smoking is one of the things we can do to reduce the health consequences of the disease.'

At the start of the pandemic, when little was known about SARS-CoV-2, the virus which causes Covid-19, researchers instinctively warned smokers would be at higher risk, due to the fact the coronavirus targets the respiratory system and the known link between smoking and lung cancer, strokes, diabetes and other chronic conditions that target this same system.

Artist David Hockney first suggested the idea that smokers may be less at risk because the nicotine-fuelled habit hardens the immune systems and bodies of smokers, leading to tougher respiratory systems.

The 82-year-old noted in April 2020 that Greece had one of the pandemic's lowest death tolls in Europe, despite having an above-average number of smokers. Greece has to-date experienced fewer than 5,000 deaths and around 133,000 cases.

The UK, in contrast, has recorded more than 76,000 deaths and the Office for National Statistics revealed yesterday that there are currently 1.1million Britons infected with Covid-19 – around one in 50.

Studies later emerged which agreed with Mr Hockney, finding smokers may indeed be at reduced risk, and experts floundered to explain how this could be, calling it 'weird' and 'bizarre'.

Despite the confounding evidence, the World Health Organization declared in June that smoking may make people more susceptible to COVID-19.

But a study published earlier that month from Mexico analysed data from almost 90,000 patients and found smokers were 23 per cent less likely than non-smokers to get diagnosed with Covid-19.

Smoking doubles the risk of developing a severe case of coronavirus and needing hospitalisation, a study claims. The research is the first conclusive proof that being a smoker puts individuals at higher risk of severe disease than non-smokers

Smoking causes THREE times as many cells to be infected with coronavirus Smoking cigarettes increases the risk of severe coronavirus infection by dampening the immune response of the body, a new study suggests. Lab studies on airway models made from human stem cells reveals smoking stops key immune system molecules, called interferons, from working properly. Interferons are messengers that tell infected cells to make proteins to attack the invading pathogen, and are essential for fighting off initial infection. They also summon support from the wider immune system and warn uninfected cells to prepare for the virus. The study found smoking stops this pathway from working properly, and this causes up to a threefold increase in the number of human cells infected by the virus. Advertisement

And the team also found smokers who did get infected were no more likely to need intensive care, be hooked up to a ventilator, or die.

University College London academics looked at 28 papers and found the proportion of smokers among hospital patients was 'lower than expected'.

But other studies have been published suggesting smokers may be at increased risk, however scientists have, until now, struggled to provide real-world data to support this.

A recent study by academics at UCLA used lab-grown stem cells and found smoking causes three times as many cells to be infected with coronavirus.

The study showed smoking stops key immune system molecules, called interferons, from working properly.

Interferons are messengers that tell infected cells to make proteins to attack the invading pathogen, and are essential for fighting off initial infection.

They also summon support from the wider immune system and warn uninfected cells to prepare for the virus.

The study found smoking stops this pathway from working properly, and this causes up to a threefold increase in the number of human cells infected by the virus.

'If you think of the airways like the high walls that protect a castle, smoking cigarettes is like creating holes in these walls,' Dr Brigitte Gomperts, from UCLA, said in November.

'Smoking reduces the natural defenses and that allows the virus to set in.'","['Joe Pinkstone', 'Joe Pinkstone For Mailonline']",https://news.google.com,high
A Shameful Attack on Democracy Itself,"The divisions in our country did not start with Donald Trump, but as president, he has poured gasoline on already raging fires. This is where it has brought us.

Trump supporters clash with police and security forces as they storm the US Capitol in Washington, D.C. on January 6, 2021. Brendan Smialowski/AFP via Getty Images

A Republican faction openly trying to overturn the results of a presidential election and install President Trump for a second term, in defiance of the public will. Trump in the backyard of the White House urging supporters to protest free and fair election results. A mob of Trump backers assaulting security staff, storming the Capitol, and forcing the emergency lockdown of the seat of representative government in America.

“It’s not protest,” President-elect Joe Biden said. “It’s insurrection.”

This shameful attack on democracy itself is where we found ourselves on Wednesday, after dozens of Republicans in the House and Senate tried to thwart the election of Joe Biden and block the president-elect from taking office January 20.

Specifically, these Republicans sought to derail what is normally a formality—the ceremonial counting by Congress of the Electoral College votes submitted by states—by calling for what Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) described as a “tribunal” to examine election processes and outcomes in several key swing states that Trump lost.

The effort was doomed to fail because Democrats and a majority of Republicans in both houses were poised to stand up for constitutional democracy. A failed attempt to overturn our elections, though, is cause for concern, not relief.

The partisan effort was backed by several thousand Trump supporters. Urged to action by the president himself, some stormed the U.S. Capitol, assaulted and overwhelmed police and overran metal barricades, forcing the emergency recess of Congress and temporary lockdown of the Capitol.

The lawless and dangerous disruption was encouraged for weeks by Trump, who took to the grassy Ellipse behind the White House to issue an angry call for supporters to take the Capitol in protest of the election results.

“We will never give up. We will never concede. It doesn’t happen. You don’t concede when there’s theft involved,” Trump told a crowd of supporters, shortly before rioters—many of them wearing helmets and paramilitary vests—breached the security perimeter and forced their way into the Capitol.

Ironically, these unprecedented attacks on our democracy unfolded on a day when the voice of the people triumphed elsewhere, electing the Reverend Raphael Warnock, the first Black candidate Georgia has ever sent to the U.S. Senate. That’s progress we all should be celebrating, and it sends a powerful and unmistakable message about the change sweeping the country, at a time when addressing racial injustice, in all its forms, must be central to our larger task of building back better.

Newly elected Senators Reverend Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images

And the election of Jon Ossoff from the same state shifts control of the Senate to Biden’s party, giving him the congressional support required to enact an agenda focused on urgent action to tame the pandemic, get our economy humming again, advance racial equity, and confront the climate crisis.

That’s how democracy is supposed to work. It is not where Trump, his congressional enablers, or his violent mob would take us. So let’s be clear about three things:

First, those who act to subvert the will of the people and the law of the land are in breach of their sworn oath to protect the Constitution. They’re unfit to hold public office.

Second, the sanctity of U.S. democracy depends, absolutely, on public confidence in the legitimacy of our elections. These actions are meant to erode that trust, by asserting claims without evidence.

Finally, the effort to disenfranchise voters who opposed Trump is deliberately aimed at preemptively delegitimizing the Biden presidency, undercutting his ability to govern and restore unity to the nation.

Instead, in a country riven by partisan divisions, a large and growing segment is being led to a fight over whether we continue to be governed by the consent of the governed or give way to a tyrant’s rule.

No one, of course, is contesting the legitimacy of elections in the states Trump won. The ringleaders of this attempt to seize power are trafficking in unproven allegations meant to sow doubt in the legitimacy of election outcomes in selected states like Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin—swing states that Biden won.

The truth is, these elections and their outcome were, and are, legitimate. Biden won the election fair and square, by a popular vote margin of more than 7 million votes and, in the Electoral College, by a margin of 306 to Trump’s 232.

That’s what state election officials have certified, no evidence has been presented to the contrary, and more than 80 state and federal judges have affirmed as much in rulings in some 50 different cases.

Trump’s backers aren’t trying to prove that these officials and judges are wrong. There’s no case to be made that they are. This is all about feeding anger and fueling distrust in the hearts and minds of the Trump supporters who simply refuse to accept the election results, largely because Trump spent months, in advance of the elections, priming them to reject any outcome other than victory.

What must be rejected, though, is the effort to drown out the voice of the people with the rage of a political mob. Our vote is sacrosanct, the foundation of our democracy, and we will not sit quietly in the face of rogue attempts to overturn free and fair elections.

The divisions in our country did not start with the Trump presidency, nor will they end with it. As president, though, Trump has taken every opportunity to use the bully pulpit to pour gasoline on already raging fires, to embolden and empower those who seek to attack the very people our systems have already made the most vulnerable. This is where it has brought us.

We have a lot of work to do. And a lot of healing. Even more so after Wednesday.","['Mitchell Bernard', 'January']",https://www.nrdc.org,mostly high
Neonic Pesticides – Potential Risks to Brain and Sperm,"Neonicotinoid insecticides or “neonics”—the most widely class of insecticides worldwide—have long been linked to massive losses of bees and butterflies, despite industry efforts to downplay their leading role. Science also ties neonics to declining bird species, dramatic losses of fish populations, and birth defects in white-tailed deer.

But neonics may be a problem for more than just the birds and the bees. Commonly found in water supplies, food, and human bodies across the country, these popular chemicals are increasingly becoming part of our daily lives. That’s also of increasing concern to health professionals as new studies illuminate the serious risks that these everyday exposures may pose for people, especially children.

While more research on neonics’ possible human health harms is sorely needed, what we already know is worrying, and scrutiny is growing. For example, California is currently considering whether to list some of the neonic pesticides under Proposition 65 based on their neurodevelopmental and reproductive effects (i.e., brain and sperm damage), with a committee of experts (the “DARTIC” committee) discussing it last month (see NRDC’s comments here). However, since the evidence we have on neonics’ potential human health impacts to date is little known to the public, often ignored by regulators, and (as with the wildlife data) downplayed by industry, it’s worth a quick review:

HOW NEONICS WORK – They Target the Brain and Nervous System

Neonics are neurotoxic insecticides. They permanently bind to insect nerve cells, overstimulating and destroying them—commonly causing uncontrollable shaking or twitching, paralysis, and (eventually) death. Neonics bind to nicotinic acetylcholine (nACh) receptors, so called because they are activated by nicotine. Neonicotinoids (meaning “new nicotine-like” substance) get their name because they activate nACh receptors too.

But nACh receptors aren’t only in insect nerve cells, they’re also in the brain cells of people, where they play a central role in the operations of our brain and nervous systems, including learning, memory, mood, sensory processing, and pain. And there’s reasons to fear the impacts of nicotine-like substances on the brain, particularly for young, developing brains. In fact, health experts have long warned pregnant women to avoid nicotine because we know it isn’t safe for the fetus.

To get even more fine-grained, neonics are designed to bind to a subunit of the nACh receptor, called the alpha-4-beta-2 (α4β2) subunit. This subunit is a part of all insect nACh receptors, but a lesser fraction of those in people. Nonetheless, critical areas of the human brain are densely populated with nACh receptors containing the α4β2 subunit, including: the cortex (responsible for planning, judgment, creativity, inhibition, attention, memory, language); the thalamus (emotion, memory, relay sensory information between the cortex and the cerebellum); and, the cerebellum (posture, balance, coordination, speech). In other words, this receptor subtype may number fewer in people than in insects proportionally, but it’s all over critically important areas of the brain.





To make an analogy, a needle poke will hurt an insect more than a human, but it is still important to ask what happens if a person gets that needle poke in a sensitive area like the eye. With neonics, the concern is about getting a needle poke (or many) in critical regions of the brain during sensitive life-stages of brain development.

EVIDENCE OF EXPOSURE – Half the U.S. Population Regularly Dosed with Neonics

To continue the metaphor, the first key question is how many people are getting poked with neonic needles? As it turns out, you don’t need to go looking in haystacks.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) finds that roughly half the U.S. population is exposed to at least one neonic chemical on a regular basis (Ospina et al. 2019). That analysis looked for neonic breakdown products or “metabolites” in urine from a random population sample of thousands of people, finding acetamiprid (35% of samples) and imidacloprid metabolites (20% of samples) most commonly and also at the highest levels (95th percentile concentrations were 1.29 and 1.37 µg/L respectively).

Compared with adults, young children age 3 to 5 years old had higher neonic exposures, likely from eating non-organic (conventionally grown) foods. While the CDC study does not include children under 3 years old, the EPA has estimated that infants up to 1 year old are exposed through diet (food and water) to roughly 70-80% of the maximum acceptable limit (called the acute Population Adjusted Dose, or aPAD) for each of acetamiprid (69% of aPAD, 0.071 mg/kg-day) and imidacloprid (84% of aPAD, 0.08 mg/kg-day). Had EPA evaluated the cumulative toxic impacts of all neonics together (which it should have) then exposure to infants would exceed EPA’s acceptable limit.

So how are these neonics entering people’s bodies? Most people exposed would have to search no further than their refrigerator or the tap at their kitchen sink.

Favorite Kids Foods Contaminated with Neonics (Good news - Organics Are Mostly Neonic-Free)

Pesticide Action Network https://www.whatsonmyfood.org

On organic foods—where neonic use is prohibited—neonics were rarely detected. However, in a sign of how pervasive neonic contamination is, research has shown that neonics even show up in a very small percentage of organic produce too.

What’s on Tap? Neonics!

In addition to our favorite foods, neonics also run off farm fields, lawns, and gardens into waterways and groundwater—with federal government research showing neonics in about half of U.S. streams tested. While modern filtration systems can remove neonics, standard chlorination treatment doesn’t, meaning homes that pull from groundwater or older treatment systems are at higher risk of finding neonics in their tap. For example, one study found neonics “ubiquitously” in tap water at the University of Iowa. Even worse, some government and university experts are warning that neonics have the potential to form even more toxic compounds when they are chlorinated during routine tap water treatment (see details in my previous blog; Klarich Wong et al. 2019).

Poisoning from Household Products

Imidacloprid is the most common neonic used in household products (e.g., bed bug and pet flea treatments), and, in the last decade, there’s been an astounding 1,630 imidacloprid poisoning incidents according to data collected by EPA (see here). The reported symptoms include skin rash, muscle tremor, difficulty breathing, vomiting, wheezing, lock jaw, memory loss, and renal failure. Other severe symptoms are described in EPA’s Pesticide Poisoning Handbook:

“Patients have presented with disorientation, confusion and agitation – severe enough to require sedation – headache, drowsiness, dizziness, weakness, tremor and, in some situations, loss of consciousness.” (EPA 2013, p. 90).

These poisonings are evidence that consumers using these neonic products are getting exposed to imidacloprid at levels that cause poisoning symptoms severe enough for them to seek medical attention, but they likely represent only a fraction of actual poisonings. Note: To report a pesticide poisoning – including to people, pets, and wildlife - call a Poison Control Center, or follow the instructions on EPA’s webpage.

EVIDENCE OF HAZARD – Developmental and Reproductive Risks

Science has long recognized that even small toxic exposures that occur during early development are more likely to lead to permanent or debilitating effects throughout life (for example, see NAS 1993, and FQPA 1996). A growing body of scientific evidence now demonstrates these sorts of hazards are very real for neonics—and are made even more concerning by the fact that neonic exposure is chronic and widespread across the country. While more research is critically needed, here is a summary of the human and animal research raising alarms:

Human Studies – Potential Elevated Risk of Birth Defects in Prenatally Exposed Children

A systematic review of publicly available literature on unintentional human exposures to neonics reported a link between neonic exposures and malformations of the developing heart and brain, as well as a cluster of symptoms including memory loss and finger tremors (Cimino et al. 2017). The review highlights three epidemiologic studies of U.S. populations that report a suggestive association between prenatal exposure to neonic pesticides and birth defects:

Autism like symptoms - A study by NIH-funded researchers from UNC Chapel Hill and UC Davis reported that frequent exposure (self-reported by parents) to imidacloprid applied as flea and tick treatments for pets (Advantage by Bayer) during pregnancy was associated with a 2-fold elevated risk of autism spectrum disorder in prenatally-exposed children (odds ratio 2.0, 95% confidence interval 1.0-3.9 based on 407 children with confirmed autism spectrum disorder) (Keil et al. 2014).

Birth defects of the heart - A study of infants born with heart defects born to mothers in California’s San Joaquin valley reported a statistically significant association between living close to agriculture areas that use imidacloprid and having a baby born with a rare heart defect called the teratology of Fallot (adjusted odds ratio 2.4, 95% confidence interval 1.1-5.4 based on 101 cases of heart defects) (Carmichael et al. 2014).

Birth defects of the brain - A study of the same population of mothers in California’s San Joaquin valley reported a suggestive association between living near agriculture areas that use imidacloprid and an almost 3-fold elevated risk of having a baby born with anencephaly, lacking parts of the brain and skull (adjusted odds ratio 2.9, 95% confidence interval 1.0, 8.2 based on 73 cases of anencephaly) (Yang et al. 2014).

While these studies are limited by small numbers of study subjects, they are well-conducted, the exposures are well-characterized, and the statistical analysis is appropriate. They also have all been peer-reviewed and published in respected scientific journals. These studies are considered by the authors to largely be “hypothesis generating studies” that raise red flags and signal the need for more additional studies.

Animal Studies – Poor Sperm Quality and Quantity

Several rat studies report adverse effects of acetamiprid on sperm, including dose-dependent decreases sperm concentration and testosterone levels associated with a 90-day neonic exposure (Arican et al. 2020), increases in abnormal sperm and low sperm count (Mosbah et al. 2018), and a guinea pig study showing acetamiprid caused cell membrane degradation in the testis (Guiekep et al. 2019).

Likewise, imidacloprid rat studies also report effects on male reproductive system, including decreased sperm count, sperm motility, and live sperm, and decreased testosterone (Lonare et al. 2016; Bal, Naziroglu et al. 2012; Bal, Turk et al. 2012; Najafi et al. 2010). Additional studies reported on increased sperm abnormalities in rats (Hafez et al. 2016) and mice (Bagri et al. 2015).

This is relevant to humans, given that roughly one-third of all infertility is due to the male, with the most common cause being deficiencies in sperm quality and sperm count.

Animal Studies – Developmental Neurotoxicity

A number of animal studies show that prenatal exposure to neonics increases the risk of neurodevelopmental abnormalities and birth defects. In addition to published scientific studies these also include laboratory animal studies submitted by pesticide manufacturers to EPA support regulatory approval for neonics.

Based in large part on the above studies, the Endocrine Society submitted comments to EPA citing the “substantial and increasing body of literature linking exposure to neonicotinoid pesticides and developmental thyroid toxicity in wildlife.” As thyroid functioning is critical to brain development, and “[neonic] chemicals may have effects at extremely low doses,” the comments warn “there may in fact be no ‘safe’ level for these chemicals.”

Harms found to animals that raise human health concerns include:

Reduced thyroid function in deer - Developmental abnormalities in white-tailed deer exposed to real-world levels of imidacloprid in their water had a higher risk of hypothyroidism and lethargy, decreased body and organ weight, decreased jawbone length, and higher mortality rates for fawns. (Berheim et al. 2019).

Thinning of some brain areas and under-activity in rats - An unpublished Bayer-sponsored rat study reported imidacloprid exposure during pregnancy produced an overall reduced activity in the offspring, and a statistically significant 2% decrease in the thickness of two areas of the brain involved in regulating movement (caudate and putamen) in the high dose female rats. (see EPA DER 2002; study MRID 45537501).

Thinning of some brain areas, altered reflexes, delayed sexual development - An unpublished Syngenta-sponsored rat study reported that exposure to the neonic thiamethoxam during pregnancy produced statistically significant adverse effects in offspring in many of the low (4.3 mg/kg) and middle dose (34.5 mg/kg) groups and all of the high dose (298.7 mg/kg) groups. These included a thinner brain cortex, altered auditory startle reflexes, delayed reproductive development (delayed preputial separation) in males, and an increase in stillbirths (EPA DER 2005; study MRID 47034201, 46028202).

Sensorimotor deficits in rats – One study found neurobehavioral impairments in rodents exposed prenatally to a single high sublethal injection of imidacloprid (337 mg/kg at day 9 of pregnancy). Effects included sensorimotor deficits like reduced beam walking time and reduced forepaw grip time (from about 3.5 seconds in control animals, to below 1 second in imidacloprid-exposed rats. (Abou-Donia et al. 2008).

EPA’S REGULATORY FAILURE

The EPA Pesticide Office has had access to the growing body of evidence on neonics’ neurotoxicity for years, but has failed to take protective action—or even honestly acknowledge the risks—proposing only minimal restrictions in its recent review of neonics. EPA’s proposal not only continues to leave bees and other wildlife exposed to the widespread, wasteful neonic use decimating their populations (see NRDC’s comments here), it violates the Food Quality Protection Act (FQPA), passed unanimously by Congress in 1996 to protect human health (see NRDC’s 2020 petition).

The FQPA requires EPA to consider potential pesticide exposures from all sources during the entire span of human development, using a “risk cup” approach. Where those exposures exceed EPA’s maximum acceptable limit (again, the Population Adjusted Dose, or “PAD”), the risk cup overflows. EPA must then cancel or restrict uses so that the total exposures no longer spill out of the cup, i.e. do not exceed the PAD. In order to protect children and other sensitive populations, the FQPA requires that EPA multiply the risk in the cup by 10 (the “Child Safety Factor”) in absence of reliable evidence justifying a lower margin of safety. It must also consider the cumulative risk of all pesticides sharing a common mechanism of toxicity (i.e., that cause harm in the same way) together in the same risk cup.

For neonics, EPA discarded the Child Safety Factor for each of the five registered neonics (that is, reduced it to 1X), despite considerable evidence of neonics’ risks to early life stages of neurodevelopment and no justification for removing the legally required protection for children. It also ignored neonics’ common mechanism of toxicity (all target the nACh receptor), considering the risks from each neonic chemical separately, not cumulatively (i.e., splitting the risk into five cups instead of one, so that none would overflow) when real-world evidence demonstrates that many Americans are routinely exposed more than one neonic at once.

Despite EPA’s questionable and illegal math (again, see NRDC’s 2020 petition for all the details), the agency was still compelled by law to propose canceling certain imidacloprid lawn products to protect human health. That means that if EPA actually followed the law (i.e., assessed all the risk cumulatively in the same “cup” with the required 10X FQPA Child Safety Factor), EPA would have to cancel or severely restrict many more neonic uses.

HEALTH-PROTECTIVE ACTION NEEDED

The serious health concerns raised by laboratory and epidemiologic studies demand greater protections for people from neonic exposures—especially from widespread and wasteful neonic uses—while further research is conducted. While we hope that 2021 is the year that EPA sets the record straight on the neonics and puts the health and safety of our families and our environment first, the agency’s pesticide office has a long and troubled history.

Consumers can put a dent in neonic and other toxic pesticide pollution by avoiding insecticides and herbicides on lawns and gardens, purchasing organic produce when feasible, avoiding neonic-based pet flea and tick products, and supporting local initiatives to keep pesticides off public spaces like parks and playgrounds.

Protective actions by states and local jurisdictions will continue to be critical for protecting their residents for some time. You can TAKE ACTION to support our work to protect New Jersey, California, and New York’s people and wildlife from neonics.","['Jennifer Sass', 'January']",https://www.nrdc.org,mostly high
Romney tells Republican colleagues 'this is what you've gotten' as Senate shelters in breached Capitol,"The Conversation

Mike Pence has remained one of the only constants in the often chaotic Trump administration.Variously described as “vanilla,” “steady” and loyal to the point of being “sycophantic,” he is, in the words of one profile, an “everyman’s man with Midwest humility and approachability,” and in another, a “61-year-old, soft-spoken, deeply religious man.”But that humility and loyalty are being tested as his tenure as vice president draws to an end. “I hope Mike Pence comes through for us,” Trump told supporters at a rally on Monday, seemingly under the mistaken belief that Pence can overturn the election result as he presides over the Electoral College vote count at a joint session of Congress today. Balancing the ticketThroughout the past four years, the vice president has offered a striking contrast to the mercurial, abrasive temperament of his commander in chief. Indeed, in his acceptance speech at the 2016 Republican National Convention, Pence joked that he’d been chosen because Trump, with his “large personality,” “colorful style,” and “lots of charisma,” was “looking for some balance on the ticket.” Commentators have attributed Pence’s steadiness to his Hoosier roots and his “savvy political operator” skills. But it is his religious beliefs that perhaps inform his politics and style more than anything else; as Pence has oft repeated, he is “a Christian, conservative and Republican – in that order.” In a 2011 profile during Pence’s run for Indiana governor, noted state political columnist Brian Howey remarked, “Pence doesn’t just wear his faith on his sleeve, he wears the whole Jesus jersey.”It isn’t a characterization that Pence has shied away from. “My Christian faith is at the very heart of who I am,” Pence said during the 2016 vice presidential debate.Richard Land, former president of the Southern Baptist Convention’s Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission and current president of Southern Evangelical Seminary in Charlotte, told the Atlantic in 2018, “Mike Pence is the 24-karat-gold model of what we want in an evangelical politician. I don’t know anyone who’s more consistent in bringing his evangelical Christian worldview to public policy.” But as a scholar of U.S. religion and culture, I believe that Pence’s faith and political identities are more complex than these statements suggest. In fact, one can trace three distinct conversion experiences in his biography. Three-point conversionGrowing up in an Irish Catholic family with five siblings, working-class roots and Democratic political commitments, Pence attended Catholic school, served as an altar boy at his family’s church, idolized John F. Kennedy and was a youth coordinator for the local Democratic Party in his teens.It was as a freshman at Hanover College in 1978 that Pence experienced an evangelical conversion while attending a music festival in Kentucky billed as the “Christian Woodstock.”For some years afterward he remained active in the Catholic Church, attending Mass regularly, serving as a youth minister and seriously considering joining the priesthood. At the same time, he and his future wife Karen were part of a demographic shift of Americans who “had grown up Catholic and still loved many things about the Catholic Church, but also really loved the concept of having a very personal relationship with Christ,” as a close friend put it.By the mid-1990s he was a married father of three who identified as a “born-again, evangelical Catholic,” an unusual term that has caused some consternation among both evangelicals and Catholics.In subsequent interviews, Pence has spoken freely about how his 1978 conversion gave him a “personal relationship with Jesus Christ” that “changed everything.” But he has tended to avoid labeling his religious views when pressed, referring to himself as a “pretty ordinary Christian” who “cherishes his Catholic upbringing.” He has attended nondenominational evangelical churches with his family since at least 1995. Pence’s political conversion was more clear cut. Though he voted for Jimmy Carter in the 1980 presidential election, he quickly came to embrace Ronald Reagan’s economic and social conservatism and his populist appeal.

‘Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell’: Democrats including Hillary Clinton and AOC rejoice over Georgia as Trump goes wild on Twitter,"Hillary Clinton, quien perdió ante Donald Trump en 2016 (Getty Images for Refinery29)

“Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell.”

The unfamiliar phrase served as a cry of relief for Democrats nationwide rejoicing in the news coming out of Georgia, where senatorial candidates Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock were leading in the state’s runoff elections.

By Wednesday, both Democrats had declared victory against their Republican opponents, Senators David Perdue (R—GA) and Kelly Loeffler (R—GA), following record-level early voter turnout and massive fundraising efforts launched by both national parties.

While the Associated Press has not yet called both races for the Democrats, many were already celebrating the win across social media, with everyone from Hillary Clinton to lawmakers on Capitol Hill sharing in the festivities.

“Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell has a nice ring to it,” Gavin Newson, the Democratic governor of California, wrote in a tweet.

Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D—WA) said she was “just practicing” the Senate majority leader’s new title in a post, adding: “Sounding very, very good.”

Meanwhile, the current Senate minority leader, Senator Chuck Schumer (D—NY), offered his own two cents in a tweet that simply read: “Buckle up!”

Joy comes in the morning. Thank you, Georgia. pic.twitter.com/Dw8wPWAMeI — Senator-Elect Reverend Raphael Warnock (@ReverendWarnock) January 6, 2021

The news that both Mr Ossoff and Mr Warnock potentially unseated both Republicans in the once-reliably red state — which had not voted for a Democratic president since 1992, before flipping to President-elect Joe Biden in the November race — came as a shock to members on both sides of the political aisle this week.

Though polls showed a narrowing race between the Republican and Democratic candidates, folks were clearly surprised by the results as they come flooding in on Tuesday night.

But the president was anything but happy on Twitter, launching an all-caps tirade and describing the Democrats as “scoundrels” in a series of tweets that falsely claimed allegations of rampant voter fraud.

THE REPUBLICAN PARTY AND, MORE IMPORTANTLY, OUR COUNTRY, NEEDS THE PRESIDENCY MORE THAN EVER BEFORE - THE POWER OF THE VETO. STAY STRONG! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 6, 2021

Mr Trump’s tweets, almost immediately flagged by the platform for containing disputed claims of election fraud, urged Republicans to “be strong!” and continue fighting.

The news comes as Congress convenes to certify Mr Biden’s victory in the presidential elections on Wednesday, a typically mundane process that has become a potential flashpoint of controversy, with Mr Trump demanding Vice President Mike Pence — who oversees the event in a mostly symbolic role — to somehow intervene.

Mr Pence does not possess the power to intervene in the electoral process, however, and the national vote has already been certified by the Electoral College.",[],https://news.yahoo.com,high
Trump Is Furious—but Not at the MAGA Mob That Stormed the Capitol,"Shawn Thew/EPA/Bloomberg via Getty

As President Trump watched a mob of thousands of his supporters storm the seat of the United States government on Wednesday from a safe distance, he characteristically stewed and blew off steam in the White House—but not at the public displays of anti-democratic action that were unfolding in the nation’s capital.

Upon arrival back at the White House, the president vented his fury that politicians and people on cable news were already starting to hold him responsible for the day’s mayhem, according to two people familiar with the situation. Predictably, Trump held the position that it wasn’t his fault, and that a strong public denunciation was not necessary at the time, the sources relayed.

Trump did, however, make time to continue privately griping throughout Wednesday afternoon about how unfair his own vice president was being to him.

White House spokespeople did not immediately provide comment for this story.

Trump’s only public statements of the afternoon came via his preferred medium of Twitter. As the mob stormed the gates of the Capitol Building, the president was busy lashing out at his own vice president for refusing to nullify a presidential election in order to illegally keep him in power.

“Mike Pence didn’t have the courage to do what should have been done to protect our Country and our Constitution,” he complained. Fifteen minutes later, he followed up with a perfunctory request for the rioters to “stay peaceful!” Only after Vice President Mike Pence and the Senate’s most senior Republican, Iowa’s Chuck Grassley, were evacuated to a secure location did the president more forcefully plead with his legions of supporters—some of whom had professed a willingness to die in the name of Trump’s re-election—did the president issue a more impassioned plea for his supporters to stand down.

“I am asking for everyone at the U.S. Capitol to remain peaceful. No violence!” he tweeted. “Remember, WE are the Party of Law & Order – respect the Law and our great men and women in Blue. Thank you!”

Story continues

Members of Trump’s family quickly chimed in as well. “The violence must stop immediately. Please be peaceful,” tweeted Ivanka Trump. Her tweet, which referred to the mob as “American Patriots,” was quickly deleted.

Despite their tweets, rioters pushed past police barricades surrounding the Capitol, smashed windows, and pushed through doors. They streamed into the building and some had soon made their way onto the floor of the U.S. Senate. Members of the mob stood atop the dais and shouted conspiracy theories about an election they insist, falsely, was stolen from President Donald Trump. On the House side, security officers barricaded the door, drew their weapons, and stood down demonstrators trying to fight their way inside.

Meanwhile, the president’s campaign was busy raising money off the election fraud conspiracy that precipitated Wednesday’s violence. “Congress is voting to certify, or OBJECT TO, the Election results. Pres Trump needs YOU to STAND WITH HIM! 1000% IMPACT! Donate,” Trump 2020 texted supporters at 1:36 p.m. ET on Wednesday, as gatherings of furious, Trump-supported MAGA fans forced the Hill into a frenzied state of lockdown and evacuation.

But the images of the day did not seem to bother the outgoing president all that much, who for weeks had been cheering on the actions of some of his most extreme, dead-ender supporters and street demonstrators. However, the images did appear to shock and disgust several of Trump’s own former and current officials, some of whom served at the most senior echelon of his administration.

“I have strong opinions about the matter,” Dan Coats, the former director of national intelligence under Trump who previously served inside the very building under attack as a U.S. senator, told The Daily Beast on Wednesday afternoon. “Obviously, this has gotten out of hand, and to the extent that the president has encouraged people without taking thought that it could turn out like this is something that should have been decided upon before it happened. I think we’re in a dire situation that could have been prevented. And that’s all I have to say on that [at this time].”

Pro-Trump MAGA Mob Clashes With Police, Storms the Capitol

Michael Short, previously a spokesman in the Trump White House who still serves in the administration, tweeted, “Unreal. The President needs to tell the crowd he recklessly whipped up into a frenzy to stand down.” Alyssa Farah, who until recently was one of Trump’s top spokespeople and communications director, posted to Twitter, “Condemn this now, @realDonaldTrump- you are the only one they will listen to. For our country!”

But Trump had another top priority this week: condemning Farah’s former boss, Pence.

Earlier in the day, Pence’s office released an official letter emphasizing that he doesn’t have the authority to decide the 2020 election—a power that Trump has falsely insisted to the public and directly to Pence that the vice president does have. The president lost it and seethed at this supposed sight of backstabbing.

For days, the president has telegraphed to aides and advisers that he was storing up his wrath for Pence, should Pence simply formally acknowledge that he cannot unilaterally upturn the 2020 presidential election and subvert the will of the American people.

Three individuals who are close to Trump and who work for him say that in conversations with the president since this past weekend, he has made clear he doesn’t intend to let Pence off the hook if (rather, when) his VP doesn’t attempt to overturn the American democratic system on Capitol Hill.

A person who’s been in direct contact with the president multiple times in recent days said close allies have warned Trump that Pence wouldn’t do what he wanted come Jan. 6, to which the president would respond with phrases such as, “he better not do that” and “we’ll have to see.” This source said that they, and some others, have specifically advised Trump to work against Pence’s future political ambitions, especially if the veep tries to run for president in the post-Trump era, should Pence cross the president on Wednesday. This source recounted that the president simply responded by saying he hopes it doesn’t come to that.

Even after Pence’s office released his letter, some associates and diehard allies of the president refused to even believe that Joe Biden would assume the highest office in the land on Inauguration Day on Jan. 20.

“[Pence’s] not going to declare Biden president-elect today,” MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell, a Trump friend and a funder of several pro-Trump events and legal efforts to overturn the 2020 election, said in a brief interview shortly after 2 p.m. ET on Wednesday. When asked about what was going on on Capitol Hill, Lindell, who was in Washington, D.C., this week to speak at and support rallies seeking to throw out the election results, added, “I don’t know what [those] protesters are doing” and that “I suppose they came out because they were angry about the letter.”

In the lead-up to Wednesday, Trump has been devoting considerable time to taking stock of who remains in his corner and who he and his inner circle can brand a turncoat or a “coward.” The president has been going out of his way to privately thank and congratulate officials, lawmakers, and cohorts for their efforts in the past few days, and claimed that they would be rewarded for their “loyalty” and that it would not be forgotten, according to several sources with direct knowledge.

On Wednesday evening, as the mob continued to mill about the Capitol, Trump took to Twitter once more to both indulge the conspiracy theories that drove the rioters to Washington in the first place and to call on them to “go home.”

“There’s never been a time like this where such a thing happened, where they could take it away from all of us, from me, from you, from our country. This was a fraudulent election,” Trump said in a video tweeted just after 4 p.m.. “But we can’t play into the hands of these people. We have to have peace.”

"Hollywood hails Stacey Abrams, LaTosha Brown after Democrats take Georgia","The Conversation

Mike Pence has remained one of the only constants in the often chaotic Trump administration.Variously described as “vanilla,” “steady” and loyal to the point of being “sycophantic,” he is, in the words of one profile, an “everyman’s man with Midwest humility and approachability,” and in another, a “61-year-old, soft-spoken, deeply religious man.”But that humility and loyalty are being tested as his tenure as vice president draws to an end. “I hope Mike Pence comes through for us,” Trump told supporters at a rally on Monday, seemingly under the mistaken belief that Pence can overturn the election result as he presides over the Electoral College vote count at a joint session of Congress today. Balancing the ticketThroughout the past four years, the vice president has offered a striking contrast to the mercurial, abrasive temperament of his commander in chief. Indeed, in his acceptance speech at the 2016 Republican National Convention, Pence joked that he’d been chosen because Trump, with his “large personality,” “colorful style,” and “lots of charisma,” was “looking for some balance on the ticket.” Commentators have attributed Pence’s steadiness to his Hoosier roots and his “savvy political operator” skills. But it is his religious beliefs that perhaps inform his politics and style more than anything else; as Pence has oft repeated, he is “a Christian, conservative and Republican – in that order.” In a 2011 profile during Pence’s run for Indiana governor, noted state political columnist Brian Howey remarked, “Pence doesn’t just wear his faith on his sleeve, he wears the whole Jesus jersey.”It isn’t a characterization that Pence has shied away from. “My Christian faith is at the very heart of who I am,” Pence said during the 2016 vice presidential debate.Richard Land, former president of the Southern Baptist Convention’s Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission and current president of Southern Evangelical Seminary in Charlotte, told the Atlantic in 2018, “Mike Pence is the 24-karat-gold model of what we want in an evangelical politician. I don’t know anyone who’s more consistent in bringing his evangelical Christian worldview to public policy.” But as a scholar of U.S. religion and culture, I believe that Pence’s faith and political identities are more complex than these statements suggest. In fact, one can trace three distinct conversion experiences in his biography. Three-point conversionGrowing up in an Irish Catholic family with five siblings, working-class roots and Democratic political commitments, Pence attended Catholic school, served as an altar boy at his family’s church, idolized John F. Kennedy and was a youth coordinator for the local Democratic Party in his teens.It was as a freshman at Hanover College in 1978 that Pence experienced an evangelical conversion while attending a music festival in Kentucky billed as the “Christian Woodstock.”For some years afterward he remained active in the Catholic Church, attending Mass regularly, serving as a youth minister and seriously considering joining the priesthood. At the same time, he and his future wife Karen were part of a demographic shift of Americans who “had grown up Catholic and still loved many things about the Catholic Church, but also really loved the concept of having a very personal relationship with Christ,” as a close friend put it.By the mid-1990s he was a married father of three who identified as a “born-again, evangelical Catholic,” an unusual term that has caused some consternation among both evangelicals and Catholics.In subsequent interviews, Pence has spoken freely about how his 1978 conversion gave him a “personal relationship with Jesus Christ” that “changed everything.” But he has tended to avoid labeling his religious views when pressed, referring to himself as a “pretty ordinary Christian” who “cherishes his Catholic upbringing.” He has attended nondenominational evangelical churches with his family since at least 1995. Pence’s political conversion was more clear cut. Though he voted for Jimmy Carter in the 1980 presidential election, he quickly came to embrace Ronald Reagan’s economic and social conservatism and his populist appeal. In a 2016 speech at the Reagan Library, Pence credited Reagan with inspiring him to “leave the party of my youth and become a Republican like he did.” “His broad-shouldered leadership changed my life,” he said.

Wade is sent to the ash heap of history,” he said at the time.In 2016, over the objections of many Republican state representatives, he signed the most restrictive set of anti-abortion measures in the country into law, making him a conservative hero. Among other things, the bill prevented women from terminating pregnancies for reasons including fetal disability such as Down syndrome. Although opponents succeeded in getting the bill overturned in the courts, Indiana is still seen as one of the most anti-abortion states in America.As vice president, Pence also cast the tie-breaking Senate vote to allow states to withhold federal family planning funds from Planned Parenthood in 2017.Pence has also been an outspoken opponent of LGBTQ rights. He opposed the inclusion of sexual orientation in hate crimes legislation and the end of the military’s “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” policy. He likewise supported both state and federal constitutional amendments to ban same-sex marriage, and expressed disappointment at the 2015 Obergefell decision, which required all states to recognize such unions.At the same time he has been a strong supporter of “religious freedom,” particularly for Christians.In March 2015, as Indiana governor, he signed the state’s Religious Freedom Restoration Act “to ensure that religious liberty is fully protected.” The act ignited a firestorm of nationwide controversy: Critics alleged that it would allow for individuals and businesses to legally discriminate against members of the LGBTQ community. Under pressure from LGBTQ activists, liberals, business owners and moderate Republicans, Pence signed an amendment a week later stipulating that it did not authorize discrimination. Staked reputationPence’s religious and political biography mirrors key political and religious shifts over the past 40 years, from the rise of the religious right and its growing influence in the Republican Party to the conservative coalition of evangelicals and Catholics across denominational lines, to the legacy of the “outsider” celebrity president.These threads converge in Mike Pence, whose “24-karat,” “unalloyed” conservative credentials were instrumental in rallying evangelical voters behind Trump in the 2016 election and who has staked his political future on continuing to defend him.This article is republished from The Conversation, a nonprofit news site dedicated to sharing ideas from academic experts.

Today dozens of Republicans lawmakers in Congress will attempt a stunt vote that will briefly stall — but not stop — the congressional ceremony to confirm Joe Biden's presidency.

This is a disgraceful affront to democratic principles and the US Constitution.

But at the very least it makes it that much easier to spot who the phoniest politicians in Washington are.

Video: The rise of partisanship in the House of Representatives

Today 13 US Senators and as many as 140 lawmakers in the House of Representatives, all from the Republican party, plan to vote to subvert democracy and delay confirmation of Joe Biden's presidential victory.

This is a stunt, it is a disgrace, it is contrary to the principles on which this country was founded. But at least it is instructive. President Donald Trump's refusal to accept that he lost the White House has forced the most servile of his acolytes to stand proudly in their unscrupulousness in an effort to capture the attention of his base. So in the last week or so it has become that much more clear to see who - in a town known for its phonies - is the absolute phoniest.

Any politician who told you we need to have an ""emergency audit"" to investigate a lie they've been helping Trump tell for months now is a phony.

Anyone who tried to tell you that Congress can ultimately decide who is president today - against the American people's wishes and the Electoral College results - is a phony.

Anyone running around filing lawsuits that make state and federal judges around the country laugh: phony. Anyone pressuring or threatening state governments to change vote counts: phony. Anyone getting on Fox News saying that this stunt of a vote is in any way fighting for America: phony.

Masks off

Trump has done precious little for this country, but one good thing he did was draw a line in the sand. He has told Republicans that they either stand with him, or they stand with the Constitution. In forcing the most craven people on Capitol Hill to reveal themselves he's tested this country's ability to recognize a fraud. And for that, we thank him.

Story continues

For a lot of Americans, Trump's scam on democracy was clear from the beginning, so what's happening right now isn't shocking. His petulant attempts to cling to power are simply the natural consequence of having someone without morals in the White House.

But for other Americans, this vote is a new low. Even after years of watching him attempt to destroy the values and norms of our system of government, these people thought Trump would go away once he lost. These are generally people who have clung so hard to the myth that there's in an innate strength in our democracy that they have been wrong about everything over the last five years. Hopefully this is a clarifying moment for them. Nothing about democracy's success is innate. It is a difficult, imperfect practice, even for the US.

Other Americans surprised in this moment genuinely thought Trump had convinced himself that the election had been stolen from him. These people thought Trump's conspiracy theories were the result of narcissistic self-delusion, not opportunism. His call with Georgia election officials likely disabused them of that notion.

In an hour-long almost-incoherent phone call to Brad Raffensperger, Georgia's secretary of state, Trump made it clear that he was pressuring officials flip the state in his favor. In a press conference Monday Georgia election official Gabriel Sterling minced no words, saying that Trump intentionally misled"" voters about fraud in the election.

The president knows he lost, and his cronies know it too. Which means that they know full well that what they are doing right now is an attempt to steal our democracy.

These people will never change

The members of Congress voting to stall the confirmation of a free and fair election are cowards. Most aren't even confronting officials in their own states where they risk alienating voters, and all of them know this vote won't change the outcome of the election. They just know this vote will please Trump and his base, and they are willing to hurt the democracy they swore to protect in order to do so.

Just like Trump, they are people who only believe in the system as long as it works for them. When it does not, they change the rules. Calling them anti-democratic is almost too principled, they are ademocratic. They only thing they believe in is power for themselves and those like them.

We all need to remember this moment. Eventually - likely soon - one of these dozens of lawmakers will make an appeal for bipartisanship, or appeal to democracy, or argue their opponents are undermining America. When they do that, based on this vote alone, you should feel free ignore them. I would hope President-elect Joe Biden and his White House will as well.

If you want to get deep about it, what we're witnessing is another moment in which more of America's innocence is lost. It's another chip away at the myth of American exceptionalism - a myth some in this country never got to participate in anyway. That is to say, a loss of innocence isn't necessarily a bad thing. It enables us to see ourselves for who we really are, and accept all the work we have to do.

If you want to be shallow about it what we're witnessing is simply a bunch of phonies being phony. They don't know how to be anything else.
