an ordinary person', 'not because the president is a dictator as some lefties have accused but because the executive branch bears responsibility for the doj', 'and the argument that team coup keeps making is that any interference with its investigation is obstruction of justice', 'nope', 'if that were the case obama and plenty of his predecessors would have committed obstruction of justice a thousand times over', 'the president of the united states has the right to set policy', 'that includes policy for the doj', 'if the president believes that the russia investigation is a waste of time he has the right to shred it', 'if he wants to tell top officials to drop it he can do that', 'if the left wants to claim obstruction of justice it has to first find a core crime', 'it cant simply claim that hes obstructing justice', 'in their house of mirrors any white house direction on a counterintelligence investigation somehow morphs into obstruction of justice', 'no and no', 'team coup has yet to identify how the russians rigged the election election truther conspiracy 1 and what crime any americans committed during that process', 'it refuses to do that', 'instead it waves its arms pounds the pulpit and classifies its claims', 'and then it throws out perjury and obstruction of justice threats', 'no no and no', 'thats not how america works', 'and there is no justice for the
